{"title": "Monty_Python's_Life_of_Brian", "label": "Film", "text": "Monty Python's Life of Brian, also known as Life of Brian, is a 1979 British comedy film starring and written by the comedy group Monty Python (Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Terry Gilliam, Eric Idle, Terry Jones and Michael Palin). It was directed by Jones. The film tells the story of Brian Cohen (played by Chapman), a young Jewish-Roman man who is born on the same day as\u2014and next door to\u2014Jesus, and is subsequently mistaken for the Messiah.\nFollowing the withdrawal of funding by EMI Films just days before production was scheduled to begin, long-time Monty Python fan and former member of the Beatles, George Harrison, arranged financing for \"Life of Brian\" through the formation of his company HandMade Films.\nThe film's themes of religious satire were controversial at the time of its release, drawing accusations of blasphemy and protests from some religious groups. Thirty-nine local authorities in the United Kingdom either imposed an outright ban, or imposed an X (18 years) certificate. Some countries, including Ireland and Norway, banned its showing, and in a few of these, such as Italy, bans lasted decades. The filmmakers used the notoriety to promote the film, with posters in Sweden reading, \"So funny, it was banned in Norway!\"\nThe film was a box office success, the fourth-highest-grossing film in the United Kingdom in 1979, and highest grossing of any British film in the United States that year. It has remained popular and has been named as the greatest comedy film of all time by several magazines and television networks, and it later received a 95% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes with the consensus, \"One of the more cutting-edge films of the 1970s, this religious farce from the classic comedy troupe is as poignant as it is funny and satirical.\" In a 2006 Channel 4 poll, \"Life of Brian\" was ranked first on their list of the 50 Greatest Comedy Films.\nPlot.\nBrian Cohen is born in a stable next door to the one in which Jesus is born, which initially confuses the three wise men who come to praise the future King of the Jews. Brian later grows up into an idealistic young man who resents the continuing Roman occupation of Judea. While listening to Jesus's Sermon on the Mount, Brian becomes infatuated with an attractive young rebel, Judith. His desire for her and hatred of the Romans, further exaggerated by his mother revealing Brian himself is half-Roman, inspire him to join the \"People's Front of Judea\" (PFJ), one of many fractious and bickering independence movements which spend more time fighting each other than they do the Romans.\nBrian participates in an abortive attempt by the PFJ to kidnap the wife of Roman governor Pontius Pilate but is captured by the palace guards. Escaping when the guards suffer paroxysms of laughter over Pilate's speech impediment, Brian winds up trying to blend in among prophets preaching in a busy plaza, repeating fragments of Jesus' sermons. He stops his sermon mid-sentence when some Roman soldiers depart, leaving his small but intrigued audience demanding to know more. Brian grows frantic when people start following him and declare him to be the messiah. After spending a night in bed with Judith, Brian discovers an enormous crowd assembled outside his mother's house. Her attempts at dispersing the crowd are rebuffed, so she consents to Brian addressing them. He urges them to think for themselves, but they parrot his words as doctrine.\nThe PFJ seeks to exploit Brian's celebrity status by having him minister to a thronging crowd of followers demanding miracle cures. Brian sneaks out the back, only to be captured by the Romans and is sentenced to crucifixion. In celebration of Passover, a crowd has assembled outside the palace of Pilate, who offers to pardon a prisoner of their choice. The crowd shouts out names containing the letter \"r\", mocking Pilate's rhotacistic speech impediment. Eventually, Judith appears in the crowd and calls for the release of Brian, which the crowd echoes, and Pilate agrees to \"welease Bwian\".\nHis order is eventually relayed to the guards, but in a scene that parodies the climax of the film \"Spartacus\", various crucified people all claim to be \"Brian\" so they can be freed and the wrong man is released. Other opportunities for a reprieve for Brian are denied as the PFJ and then Judith praise his martyrdom, while his mother expresses regret for having raised him. Hope is renewed when a crack suicide squad from the \"Judean People's Front\" charges and prompts the Roman soldiers to flee; however, the squad commits mass suicide as a form of political protest. Condemned to a slow and painful death, Brian finds his spirits lifted by his fellow sufferers, who cheerfully sing \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life.\"\nCast.\nSeveral characters remained unnamed during the film but do have names that are used in the soundtrack album track listing and elsewhere. There is no mention in the film that Eric Idle's ever-cheerful joker is called \"Mr Cheeky\", or that the Roman guard played by Michael Palin is named \"Nisus Wettus\".\nSpike Milligan plays a prophet, ignored because his acolytes are chasing after Brian. By coincidence Milligan was visiting his old World War II battlefields in Tunisia where the film was being made. The Pythons were alerted to this one morning and he was promptly included in the scene being filmed. He disappeared in the afternoon before he could be included in any of the close-up or publicity shots for the film.\nProduction.\nPre-production.\nThere are various stories about the origins of \"Life of Brian\". Shortly after the release of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" (1975), Eric Idle flippantly suggested that the title of the Pythons' forthcoming feature would be \"Jesus Christ: Lust for Glory\" (a play on the UK title for the 1970 American film \"Patton\"). This was after he had become frustrated at repeatedly being asked what it would be called, despite the troupe not having given the matter of a third film any consideration. However, they shared a distrust of organised religion, and, after witnessing the critically acclaimed \"Holy Grail\"s enormous financial turnover, confirming an appetite among the fans for more cinematic endeavours, they began to seriously consider a film lampooning the New Testament era in the same way that \"Holy Grail\" had lampooned Arthurian legend. All they needed was an idea for a plot. Eric Idle and Terry Gilliam, while promoting \"Holy Grail\" in Amsterdam, had come up with a sketch in which Jesus' cross is falling apart because of the idiotic carpenters who built it and he angrily tells them how to do it correctly. However, after an early brainstorming stage, and despite being non-believers, they agreed that Jesus was \"definitely a good guy\" and found nothing to mock in his actual teachings: \"He's not particularly funny, what he's saying isn't mockable, it's very decent stuff\", said Idle later. After settling on the name Brian for their new protagonist, one idea considered was that of \"the 13th disciple\". The focus eventually shifted to a separate individual born at a similar time and location who would be mistaken for the Messiah, but had no desire to be followed as such.\nWriting.\nThe first draft of the screenplay, provisionally titled \"The Gospel According to St. Brian\", was ready by Christmas 1976. The final pre-production draft was ready in January 1978, following \"a concentrated two-week writing and water-skiing period in Barbados\". The film would not have been made without Python fan Beatle George Harrison, who set up HandMade Films to help fund it at a cost of \u00a33\u00a0million. Harrison put up the money for it as he \"wanted to see the movie\"\u2014later described by Terry Jones as the \"world's most expensive cinema ticket.\"\nThe original backers\u2014EMI Films and, particularly, Bernard Delfont\u2014had been scared off at the last minute by the subject matter. The very last words in the film are: \"I said to him, 'Bernie, they'll never make their money back on this one'\", teasing Delfont for his lack of faith in the project. Terry Gilliam later said, \"They pulled out on the Thursday. The crew was supposed to be leaving on the Saturday. Disastrous. It was because they read the script ... finally.\" As a reward for his help, Harrison appears in a cameo appearance as Mr. Papadopoulos, \"owner of the Mount\", who briefly shakes hands with Brian in a crowd scene (at 1:09 in the film). His one word of dialogue (a cheery but out of place Scouse \"'ullo\") had to be dubbed in later by Michael Palin.\nFilming.\nTerry Jones was solely responsible for directing, having amicably agreed with Gilliam (who co-directed \"Holy Grail\") to do so, with Gilliam concentrating on the look of the film. \"Holy Grail\"s production had often been stilted by their differences behind the camera. Gilliam again contributed two animated sequences (one being the opening credits) and took charge of set design. However, this did not put an absolute end to their feuding. On the DVD commentary, Gilliam expresses pride in one set in particular, the main hall of Pilate's fortress, which had been designed so that it looked like an ancient synagogue that the Romans had converted by dumping their structural artefacts (such as marble floors and columns) on top. He reveals his consternation at Jones for not paying enough attention to it in the cinematography. Gilliam also worked on the matte paintings, useful in particular for the very first shot of the three wise men against a star-scape and in giving the illusion of the whole of the outside of the fortress being covered in graffiti. Perhaps the most significant contribution from Gilliam was the scene in which Brian accidentally leaps off a high building and lands inside a starship about to engage in an interstellar war. This was done \"in camera\" using a hand-built model starship and miniature pyrotechnics. Gilliam recounted in an interview:\nWell, we didn't know what to do with Brian. He got himself to the top of the tower and we had to rescue him somehow, so I said, \"OK, spaceship for that.\" That was purely it. It was funny, because this was at the time when \"Star Wars\" had just come out. I remember meeting George Lucas at the baggage roundabout in the San Francisco airport, and I said, \u201cThis was my chance to do a mini \"Star Wars\" episode.\u201d\nThe film was shot on location in Monastir, Tunisia, which allowed the production to reuse sets from Franco Zeffirelli's \"Jesus of Nazareth\" (1977). The Tunisian shoot was documented by Iain Johnstone for his BBC film \"The Pythons\". Many locals were employed as extras on \"Life of Brian\". Director Jones noted, \"They were all very knowing because they'd all worked for Franco Zeffirelli on \"Jesus of Nazareth\", so I had these elderly Tunisians telling me, 'Well, Mr Zeffirelli wouldn't have done it like that, you know.'\" Further location shooting also took place in Tunisia, at Sousse (Jerusalem outer walls and gateway), Carthage (Roman theatre) and Matmata (Sermon on the Mount and Crucifixion).\nGraham Chapman, suffering from alcoholism, was so determined to play the lead role \u2013 at one point coveted by Cleese \u2013 that he dried out in time for filming, so much so that he also acted as the on-set doctor.\nRough cut and pre-screenings.\nFollowing shooting between 16 September and 12 November 1978, a two-hour rough cut of the film was put together for its first private showing in January 1979. Over the next few months \"Life of Brian\" was re-edited and re-screened a number of times for different preview audiences, losing a number of entire filmed sequences.\nEditing.\nA number of scenes were cut during the editing process. Five deleted scenes, a total of 13 minutes, including the controversial \"Otto\", were first made available in 1997 on the Criterion Collection Laserdisc. An unknown amount of raw footage was destroyed in 1998 by the company that bought Handmade Films. However, a number of them (of varying quality) were shown the following year on the Paramount Comedy Channel in the UK. The scenes shown included three shepherds discussing sheep and completely missing the arrival of the angel heralding Jesus's birth, which would have been at the very start of the film; a segment showing the attempted kidnap of Pilate's wife (a large woman played by John Case) whose escape results in a fistfight; a scene introducing hardline Zionist Otto, leader of the Judean People's Front (played by Eric Idle) and his men who practise a suicide run in the courtyard; and a brief scene in which Judith releases some birds into the air in an attempt to summon help. The shepherds' scene has badly distorted sound, and the kidnap scene has poor colour quality. The same scenes that were on the Criterion laserdisc can now be found on the Criterion Collection DVD.\nThe most controversial cuts were the scenes involving Otto, initially a recurring character, who had a thin Adolf Hitler moustache and spoke with a German accent, shouting accusations of \"racial impurity\" at Judeans who were conceived (as Brian was) when their mothers were raped by Roman centurions, as well as other Nazi phrases. The logo of the Judean People's Front, designed by Terry Gilliam, was a Star of David with a small line added to each point so it resembled a swastika, most familiar in the West as the symbol of the anti-Semitic Nazi movement. The rest of this faction also all had the same thin moustaches, and wore a spike on their helmets, similar to those on Imperial German helmets. The official reason for the cutting was that Otto's dialogue slowed down the narrative. However, Gilliam, writing in \"The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons\", said he thought it should have stayed, saying \"Listen, we've alienated the Christians, let's get the Jews now.\" Idle himself was said to have been uncomfortable with the character; \"It's essentially a pretty savage attack on rabid Zionism, suggesting it's rather akin to Nazism, which is a bit strong to take, but certainly a point of view.\" Michael Palin's personal journal entries from the period when various edits of \"Brian\" were being test-screened consistently reference the Pythons' and filmmakers' concerns that the Otto scenes were slowing the story down and thus were top of the list to be chopped from the final cut of the film. However, Oxford Brookes University historian David Nash says the removal of the scene represented \"a form of self-censorship\" and the Otto sequence \"which involved a character representative of extreme forms of Zionism\" was cut \"in the interests of smoothing the way for the film's distribution in America.\"\nThe only scene with Otto that remains in the film is during the crucifixion sequence. Otto arrives with his \"crack suicide squad\", sending the Roman soldiers fleeing in terror. Instead of doing anything useful, they \"attack\" by committing mass suicide in front of the cross (\"Zat showed 'em, huh?\" says the dying Otto, to which Brian despondently replies \"You silly sods!\"), ending Brian's hope of rescue (they do however show some signs of life during the famous rendition of \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" when they are seen waving their toes in unison in time to the music). Terry Jones once mentioned that the only reason this excerpt was not cut too was due to continuity reasons, as their dead bodies were very prominently placed throughout the rest of the scene. He acknowledged that some of the humour of this sole remaining contribution was lost through the earlier edits, but felt they were necessary to the overall pacing.\nOtto's scenes, and those with Pilate's wife, were cut from the film after the script had gone to the publishers, and so they can be found in the published version of the script. Also present is a scene where, after Brian has led the Fifth Legion to the headquarters of the People's Front of Judea, Reg (John Cleese) says \"You cunt!! You stupid, bird-brained, flat-headed...\" The profanity was overdubbed to \"you klutz\" before the film was released. Cleese approved of this editing as he felt the reaction to the profanity would \"get in the way of the comedy.\"\nAn early listing of the sequence of sketches reprinted in \"Monty Python: The Case Against\" by Robert Hewison reveals that the film was to have begun with a set of sketches at an English public school. Much of this material was first printed in the \"Monty Python's The Life of Brian / Monty Python Scrapbook\" that accompanied the original script publication of \"The Life of Brian\" and then subsequently reused. The song \"All Things Dull and Ugly\" and the parody scripture reading \"Martyrdom of St. Victor\" were performed on \"Monty Python's Contractual Obligation Album\" (1980). The idea of a violent rugby match between school masters and small boys was filmed in \"Monty Python's The Meaning of Life\" (1983). A sketch about a boy who dies at school appeared on the unreleased \"The Hastily Cobbled Together for a Fast Buck Album\" (1981).\nSoundtrack.\nAn album was also released by Monty Python in 1979 in conjunction with the film. In addition to the \"Brian Song\" and \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\", it contains scenes from the film with brief linking sections performed by Eric Idle and Graham Chapman. The album opens with a brief rendition of \"Hava Nagila\" on Scottish bagpipes. A CD version was released in 1997.\nAn album of the songs sung in \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\" was released on the Disky label. \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" was later re-released with great success, after being sung by British football fans. Its popularity became truly evident in 1982 during the Falklands War when sailors aboard the destroyer HMS \"Sheffield\", severely damaged in an Argentinean Exocet missile attack on 4 May, started singing it while awaiting rescue. Many people have come to see the song as a life-affirming ode to optimism. One of its more famous renditions was by the dignitaries of Manchester's bid to host the 2000 Olympic Games, just after they were awarded to Sydney. Idle later performed the song as part of the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" is also featured in Eric Idle's \"Spamalot\", a Broadway musical based upon \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", and was sung by the rest of the Monty Python group at Graham Chapman's memorial service and at the \"Monty Python Live At Aspen\" special. The song is a staple at Iron Maiden concerts, where the recording is played after the final encore.\nRelease.\nFor the original British and Australian releases, a spoof travelogue narrated by John Cleese, \"Away From It All\", was shown before the film itself. It consisted mostly of stock travelogue footage and featured arch comments from Cleese. For instance, a shot of Bulgarian girls in ceremonial dresses was accompanied by the comment \"Hard to believe, isn't it, that these simple happy folk are dedicated to the destruction of Western Civilisation as we know it!\", Communist Bulgaria being a member of the Warsaw Pact at the time. Not only was this a spoof of travelogues \"per se\", it was a protest against the then common practice in Britain of showing cheaply made banal short features before a main feature.\n\"Life of Brian\" opened on 17 August 1979 in five North American theatres and grossed US$140,034 ($28,007 per screen) in its opening weekend. Its total gross was $19,398,164. It was the highest grossing British film in North America that year. Released on 8 November 1979 in the UK, the film was the fourth highest-grossing film in Britain in 1979. In London, it opened at the Plaza cinema and grossed \u00a340,470 in its opening week.\nOn 30 April 2004, \"Life of Brian\" was re-released on five North American screens to \"cash in\" (as Terry Jones put it) on the box office success of Mel Gibson's \"The Passion of the Christ\". It grossed $26,376 ($5,275 per screen) in its opening weekend. It ran until October 2004, playing at 28 screens at its widest point, eventually grossing $646,124 during its re-release. By comparison, a re-release of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\" had earned $1.8 million three years earlier. A DVD of the film was also released that year.\nReception.\nReviews from critics were mostly positive on the film's release. Movie historian Leonard Maltin reported that \"This will probably offend every creed and denomination equally, but it shouldn't. The funniest and most sustained feature from Britain's bad boys.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" called the film \"the foulest-spoken biblical epic ever made, as well as the best-humored\u2014a nonstop orgy of assaults, not on anyone's virtue, but on the funny bone. It makes no difference that some of the routines fall flat because there are always others coming along immediately after that succeed.\" Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, writing, \"What's endearing about the Pythons is their good cheer, their irreverence, their willingness to allow comic situations to develop through a gradual accumulation of small insanities.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film three and a half stars, calling it \"a gentle but very funny parody of the life of Jesus, as well as of biblical movies.\" Kevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" declared, \"Even those of us who find Monty Python too hit-and-miss and gory must admit that its latest effort has numerous moments of hilarity.\" Clyde Jeavons of \"The Monthly Film Bulletin\" wrote that the script was \"occasionally over-raucous and crude,\" but found the second half of the film \"cumulatively hilarious,\" with \"a splendidly tasteless finale, which even Mel Brooks might envy.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" had a negative opinion of the film, writing that it was \"a cruel fiction to foster the delusion that 'Brian' is bristling with blasphemous nifties and throbbing with impious wit. If only it were! One might find it easier to keep from nodding off.\"\nOver time, \"Life of Brian\" has regularly been cited as a significant contender for the title \"greatest comedy film of all time\", and has been named as such in polls conducted by \"Total Film\" magazine in 2000, the British TV network Channel 4 where it topped the poll in the 50 Greatest Comedy Films, and \"The Guardian\" in 2007. Rotten Tomatoes lists it as one of the best reviewed comedies, with a 95% approval rating from 61 published reviews. A 2011 poll by \"Time Out\" magazine ranked it as the third greatest comedy film ever made, behind \"Airplane!\" and \"This is Spinal Tap\".\nThe BFI declared \"Life of Brian\" to be the 28th best British film of all time, in their equivalent of the original AFI's 100 Years...100 Movies list. It was the seventh highest ranking comedy on this list (four of the better placed efforts were classic Ealing Films). Another Channel 4 poll in 2001 named it the 23rd greatest film of all time (the only comedy that came higher was Billy Wilder's \"Some Like It Hot\", which was ranked 5th). In 2016, \"Empire\" magazine ranked \"Life of Brian\" 2nd in their list of the 100 best British films, with only David Lean\u2019s \"Lawrence of Arabia\" ranking higher.\nVarious polls have voted the line, \"He's not the Messiah, he's a very naughty boy!\" (spoken by Brian's mother Mandy to the crowd assembled outside her house), to be the funniest in film history. Other famous lines from the film have featured in polls, such as, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" and \"I'm Brian and so's my wife\".\nBlasphemy accusations.\nInitial criticism.\nRichard Webster comments in \"A Brief History of Blasphemy\" (1990) that \"internalised censorship played a significant role in the handling\" of \"Monty Python's Life of Brian\". In his view, \"As a satire on religion, this film might well be considered a rather slight production. As blasphemy it was, even in its original version, extremely mild. Yet the film was surrounded from its inception by intense anxiety, in some quarters of the Establishment, about the offence it might cause. As a result it gained a certificate for general release only after some cuts had been made. Perhaps more importantly still, the film was shunned by the BBC and ITV, who declined to show it for fear of offending Christians in the UK. Once again a blasphemy was restrained \u2013 or its circulation effectively curtailed \u2013 not by the force of law but by the internalisation of this law.\" On its initial release in the UK, the film was banned by several town councils \u2013 some of which had no cinemas within their boundaries, or had not even seen the film. A member of Harrogate council, one of those that banned the film, revealed during a television interview that the council had not seen the film, and had based their opinion on what they had been told by the Nationwide Festival of Light, a grouping with an evangelical Christian base, of which they knew nothing.\nIn New York (the film's release in the US preceded British distribution), screenings were picketed by both rabbis and nuns (\"Nuns with banners!\" observed Michael Palin). It was also banned for eight years in Ireland and for a year in Norway (it was marketed in Sweden as \"The film so funny that it was banned in Norway\"). During the film's theatrical run in Finland, a text explaining that the film was a parody of Hollywood historical epics was added to the opening credits.\nIn the UK, Mary Whitehouse, and other traditionalist Christians, pamphleteered and picketed locations where the local cinema was screening the film, a campaign that was felt to have boosted publicity. Leaflets arguing against the film's representation of the New Testament (for example, suggesting that the Wise Men would not have approached the wrong stable as they do in the opening of the film) were documented in Robert Hewison's book \"Monty Python: The Case Against\".\nCrucifixion issue.\nOne of the most controversial scenes was the film's ending: Brian's crucifixion. Many Christian protesters said that it was mocking Jesus' suffering by turning it into a \"Jolly Boys Outing\" (such as when Mr Cheeky turns to Brian and says: \"See, not so bad once you're up!\"), capped by Brian's fellow sufferers suddenly bursting into song. This is reinforced by the fact that several characters throughout the film claim crucifixion is not as bad as it seems. For example, when Brian asks his cellmate in prison what will happen to him, he replies: \"Oh, you'll probably get away with crucifixion\". In another example, Matthias, an old man who works with the People's Front of Judea, dismisses crucifixion as \"a doddle\" and says being stabbed would be worse.\nThe director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: \"Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly.\" The Pythons also pointed out that crucifixion was a standard form of execution in ancient times and not just one especially reserved for Jesus.\nResponses from the cast.\nShortly after the film was released, Cleese and Palin engaged in a debate on the BBC2 discussion programme \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\" with Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, the Bishop of Southwark, who put forward arguments against the film. Muggeridge and Stockwood, it was later claimed, had arrived 15 minutes late to see a screening of the picture prior to the debate, missing the establishing scenes demonstrating that Brian and Jesus were two different characters, and hence contended that it was a send-up of Christ himself. Both Pythons later felt that there had been a strange role reversal in the manner of the debate, with two young upstart comedians attempting to make serious, well-researched points, while the Establishment figures engaged in cheap jibes and point scoring. They also expressed disappointment in Muggeridge, whom all in Python had previously respected as a satirist (he had recently converted to Christianity after meeting Mother Teresa and experiencing what he described as a miracle). Cleese stated that his reputation had \"plummeted\" in his eyes, while Palin commented, \"He was just being Muggeridge, preferring to have a very strong contrary opinion as opposed to none at all.\" Muggeridge's verdict on the film was that it was \"Such a tenth-rate film that it couldn't possibly destroy anyone's genuine faith.\" In a 2013 interview on BBC Radio 4, Cleese stated that having recently watched the discussion again he \"was astonished, first of all, at how stupid [the two members of the Church] were, and how boring the debate became\". He added: \"I think the sad thing was that there was absolutely no attempt at a proper discussion \u2013 no attempt to find any common ground.\"\nThe Pythons unanimously deny that they were ever out to destroy people's faith. On the DVD audio commentary, they contend that the film is heretical because it lampoons the practices of modern organised religion, but that it does not blasphemously lampoon the God that Christians and Jews worship. When Jesus does appear in the film (on the Mount, speaking the Beatitudes), he is played straight (by actor Kenneth Colley) and portrayed with respect. The music and lighting make it clear that there is a genuine aura around him. The comedy begins when members of the crowd mishear his statements of peace, love and tolerance (\"I think he said, 'blessed are the cheese makers'\"). Importantly, he is distinct from the character of Brian, which is also evident in the scene where an annoying and ungrateful ex-leper pesters Brian for money, while moaning that since Jesus cured him, he has lost his source of income in the begging trade (referring to Jesus as a \"bloody do-gooder\").\nJames Crossley, however, has argued that the film makes the distinction between Jesus and the character of Brian to make a contrast between the traditional Christ of both faith and cinema and the historical figure of Jesus in critical scholarship and how critical scholars have argued that ideas later got attributed to Jesus by his followers. Crossley points out that the film uses the character of Brian to address a number of potentially controversial scholarly theories about Jesus, such as the Messianic Secret, the Jewishness of Jesus, Jesus the revolutionary, and having a single mother.\nNot all the Pythons agree on the definition of the movie's tone. There was a brief exchange that occurred when the surviving members reunited in Aspen, Colorado, in 1998. In the section where \"Life of Brian\" is discussed, Terry Jones says, \"I think the film is heretical, but it's not blasphemous.\" Eric Idle can be heard to concur, adding, \"It's a heresy.\" However, John Cleese, disagreeing, counters, \"I don\u2019t think it's a heresy. It's making fun of the way that people misunderstand the teaching.\" Jones responds, \"Of course it's a heresy, John! It's attacking the Church! And that has to be heretical.\" Cleese replies, \"No, it's not attacking the Church, necessarily. It's about people who cannot agree with each other.\"\nIn a later interview, Jones said the film \"isn't blasphemous because it doesn\u2019t touch on belief at all. It is heretical, because it touches on dogma and the interpretation of belief, rather than belief itself.\"\n21st century.\nThe film continues to cause controversy; in February 2007, the Church of St Thomas the Martyr in Newcastle upon Tyne held a public screening in the church itself, with song-sheets, organ accompaniment, stewards in costume and false beards for female members of the audience (alluding to an early scene where a group of women disguise themselves as men so that they are able to take part in a stoning). Although the screening was a sell-out, some Christian groups, notably the conservative Christian Voice, were highly critical of the decision to allow the screening to go ahead. Stephen Green, the head of Christian Voice, insisted that \"You don't promote Christ to the community by taking the mick out of him.\" The Reverend Jonathan Adams, one of the church's clergy, defended his taste in comedy, saying that it did not mock Jesus, and that it raised important issues about the hypocrisy and stupidity that can affect religion. Again on the film's DVD commentary, Cleese also spoke up for religious people who have come forward and congratulated him and his colleagues on the film's highlighting of double standards among purported followers of their own faith.\nSome bans continued into the 21st century. In 2008, Torbay Council finally permitted the film to be shown after it won an online vote for the English Riviera International Comedy Film Festival. In 2009, it was announced that a thirty-year-old ban of the film in the Welsh town of Aberystwyth had finally been lifted, and the subsequent showing was attended by Terry Jones and Michael Palin alongside mayor Sue Jones-Davies (who portrayed Judith Iscariot in the film). However, before the showing, an Aberystwyth University student discovered that a ban had only been discussed by the council and in fact that it had been shown (or scheduled to be shown) at a cinema in the town in 1981. In 2013, a German official in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia considered the film to be possibly offensive to Christians and hence subject to a local regulation prohibiting its public screening on Good Friday, despite protests by local atheists.\nPolitical satire.\nThe film pokes fun at revolutionary groups and 1970s British left-wing politics. According to Roger Wilmut, \"What the film does do is place modern stereotypes in a historical setting, which enables it to indulge in a number of sharp digs, particularly at trade unionists and guerilla organisations\". The groups in the film all oppose the Roman occupation of Judea, but fall into the familiar pattern of intense competition among factions that appears, to an outsider, to be over ideological distinctions so small as to be invisible, thus portraying the phenomenon of the narcissism of small differences. Such disunity indeed fatally beleaguered real-life Judean resistance against Roman rule. Michael Palin says that the various separatist movements were modelled on \"modern resistance groups, all with obscure acronyms which they can never remember and their conflicting agendas\".\nThe People's Front of Judea, composed of the Pythons' characters, harangue their \"rivals\" with cries of \"splitters\" and stand vehemently opposed to the Judean People's Front, the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the Judean Popular Front (the last composed of a single old man, mocking the size of real revolutionary Trotskyist factions). The infighting among revolutionary organisations is demonstrated most dramatically when the PFJ attempts to kidnap Pontius Pilate's wife, but encounters agents of the Campaign for a Free Galilee, and the two factions begin a violent brawl over which of them conceived of the plan first. When Brian exhorts them to cease their fighting to struggle \"against the common enemy,\" the revolutionaries stop and cry in unison, \"the Judean People's Front!\" However, they soon resume their fighting and, with two Roman legionaries watching bemusedly, continue until Brian is left the only survivor, at which point he is captured.\nOther scenes have the freedom fighters wasting time in debate, with one of the debated items being that they should not waste their time debating so much. There is also a famous scene in which Reg gives a revolutionary speech asking, \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" at which point the listeners outline all forms of positive aspects of the Roman occupation such as sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation, roads, a fresh water system, public health and peace, followed by \"what have the Romans ever done for us except sanitation, medicine, education...\". Python biographer George Perry notes, \"The People's Liberation Front of Judea conducts its meetings as though they have been convened by a group of shop stewards\". This joke is the reverse of a similar conversation recorded in the Babylonian Talmud; some authors have even suggested the joke is based on the Talmudic text.\nFilm analysis.\nThemes and motifs.\nBible.\nThe depictions of Jesus in two short scenes at the start of the film are strongly based on Christian iconography. The resistance fighters leave the Sermon on the Mount, which was a literal recital, angry because Jesus was too pacifistic for them. (\"Well, blessed is just about everyone with a vested interest in the status quo\u2026\") In addition to the respectful depiction of Jesus, the film does not state that there is no God or that Jesus is not the son of God. The appearance of a leper, who says he was healed by Jesus, is in line with the Gospels and their reports about Jesus performing miracles.\nAny direct reference to Jesus disappears after the introductory scenes, yet his life story partially acts as a framework and subtext for the story of Brian. Brian being a bastard of a Roman centurion could refer to the polemic legend that Jesus was the son of the Roman soldier Panthera. Disguised as a prophet, Brian talks about \"the lilies on the field\" and states more clearly, \"Don't pass judgment on other people or else you might get judged yourself\": Brian incoherently repeats statements he heard from Jesus.\nAnother significant figure in the film who is named in the Gospels is Pontius Pilate, who is humorously given rhotacism. Although there is a hint to Barabbas prior to the crucifixion, no character in \"Life of Brian\" bears any resemblances to Judas or Caiaphas. An anti-Semitic interpretation of the story is therefore excluded, according to scholars. The crucifixion scene, a central part of Christian iconography, is viewed from a historical context within the narrative style of the film. It depicts historically accurate enactment of a routinely done mass crucifixion.\nBelief and dogmatism.\nThe intended subject of the satire was not Jesus and his teachings but religious dogmatism, according to film theorists and statements from Monty Python. This is made clear in the beginning of the film during the Sermon on the Mount. Not only do the poor acoustics make it more difficult to hear what Jesus says, but the audience fails to interpret what was said correctly and sensibly. When Jesus said, \"blessed are the peacemakers\", the audience understands the phonetically similar word \"Cheesemakers\" and in turn interpret it as a metaphor and beatification of those who produce dairy products.\n\"Life of Brian\" satirises, in the words of David Hume, the \"strong propensity of mankind to [believe in] the extraordinary and the marvellous\". When Brian cuts his sermon short and turns away from the crowd, they mistake his behaviour as not wanting to share the secret to eternal life and follow him everywhere. In their need to submit to an authority, the crowd declares him first a prophet and eventually a messiah. The faithful gather beneath Brian's window en masse to receive God's blessing. This is when Brian utters the main message of the film \"you don't need to follow anybody! You've got to think for yourselves!\" Monty Python saw this central message of the satire confirmed with the protests of practising Christians after the film was released.\nAccording to Terry Jones, \"Life of Brian\" \"is not blasphemy but heresy\", because Brian contested the authority of the Church whereas the belief in God remained untouched. He goes on to mention that \"Christ [is] saying all of these wonderful things about people living together in peace and love, and then for the next two thousand years people are putting each other to death in His name because they can't agree on how He said it, or in what order He said it.\" The dispute among the followers about the correct interpretation of a sandal, which Brian lost, is in the words of Terry Jones the \"history of the Church in three minutes.\" Kevin Shilbrack shares the view that you can enjoy the movie and still be religious.\nFor the most part, lost in the religious controversy was the film's mockery of factional dogmatism among left-wing parties. According to John Cleese, an almost unmanageable number of left-wing organisations and parties was formed back then in the United Kingdom. He said that it had been so important to each of them to have one pure doctrine that they would rather fight each other than their political opponent. In the film, rather than presenting a common front as their organisational names should imply, the leader of the People's Front of Judea makes it clear that their hate for the Judean Peoples's Front is greater than their hate for the Romans. They are so caught up in constant debates that the \"rather looney bunch of revolutionaries\" indirectly accept the occupying forces as well as their execution methods as a fate they all have to endure. So, in the end, even though they have ample opportunity to rescue Brian, they instead leave Brian on the cross, thanking him for his sacrifice.\nHardly mentioned in the discussion was the sideswipe at the women's movement, which started to draw a lot of attention in the 1970s. In accordance with the language of political activists, resistance fighter Stan wants to exercise \"his right as a man\" to be a woman. The group accepts him from that moment on as Loretta, because the right to give birth was not theirs to take. Also as a result from that, the term sibling replaces the terms brother or sister.\nIndividuality and meaninglessness.\nOne of the most commented-upon scenes in the film is when Brian tells his followers that they are all individuals and don\u2019t need to follow anybody. According to Edward Slowik, this is a rare moment in which Monty Python puts a philosophical concept into words so openly and directly. \"Life of Brian\" accurately depicts the existentialist view that everybody needs to give meaning to their own life.\nBrian can thus be called an existentialist following the tradition of Friedrich Nietzsche and Jean-Paul Sartre. He is honest to himself and others and lives an authentic life as best as he can. However, Brian is too na\u00efve to be called a hero based on the ideas of Albert Camus. For Camus, the search for the meaning of one's own life takes place in a deeply meaningless and abstruse world. The \"absurd hero\" rebels against this meaninglessness and at the same time holds on to their goals, although they know their fight leaves no impact in the long run. Contrary to that, Brian isn\u2019t able to recognize the meaninglessness of his own situation and therefore can\u2019t triumph over it.\nIn \"Monty Python and Philosophy\", Kevin Shilbrack states that the fundamental view of the film is that the world is absurd, and every life needs to be lived without a greater meaning. He points out that the second-last verse of the song the film finishes on, \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\", expresses this message clearly:\nShilbrack concludes that the finale shows that the executions had no purpose since the deaths were meaningless and no better world was waiting for them. On this note, some people would claim that the film presents a nihilistic world view which contradicts any basis of religion. However, \"Life of Brian\" offers humour to counterbalance the nihilism, Shilbrack states in his text. He comments that \"religion and humour are compatible with each other and you should laugh about the absurdity since you can't fight it.\"\nLegacy.\nLiterature.\nSpin-offs include a script-book \"The Life of Brian of Nazareth\", which was printed back-to-back with \"MONTYPYTHONSCRAPBOOK\" as a single book. The printing of this book also caused problems, due to rarely used laws in the United Kingdom against blasphemy, dictating what can and cannot be written about religion. The publisher refused to print both halves of the book, and original prints were by two companies.\nJulian Doyle, the film's editor, wrote \"The Life of Brian/Jesus\", a book which not only describes the filmmaking and editing process but argues that it is the most accurate Biblical film ever made. In October 2008, a memoir by Kim \"Howard\" Johnson titled \"Monty Python's Tunisian Holiday: My Life with Brian\" was released. Johnson became friendly with the Pythons during the filming of \"Life of Brian\" and his notes and memories of the behind-the-scenes filming and make-up.\nMusic.\nWith the success of Eric Idle's musical retelling of \"Monty Python and the Holy Grail\", called \"Spamalot\", Idle announced that he would be giving \"Life of Brian\" a similar treatment. The oratorio, called \"Not the Messiah (He's a Very Naughty Boy)\", was commissioned to be part of the festival called Luminato in Toronto in June 2007, and was written/scored by Idle and John Du Prez, who also worked with Idle on \"Spamalot\". \"Not the Messiah\" is a spoof of Handel's \"Messiah\". It runs approximately 50 minutes, and was conducted at its world premiere by Toronto Symphony Orchestra music director Peter Oundjian, who is Idle's cousin. \"Not the Messiah\" received its US premiere at the Caramoor International Music Festival in Katonah, New York. Oundjian and Idle joined forces once again for a double performance of the oratorio in July 2007.\nOther media.\nIn October 2011, BBC Four premiered the made-for-television comedy film \"Holy Flying Circus\", written by Tony Roche and directed by Owen Harris. The \"Pythonesque\" film explores the events surrounding the 1979 television debate on talk show \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\" between John Cleese and Michael Palin and Malcolm Muggeridge and Mervyn Stockwood, then Bishop of Southwark.\nIn a \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\" sketch, a bishop who has directed a scandalous film called \"The Life of Christ\" is hauled over the coals by a representative of the \"Church of Python\", claiming that the film is an attack on \"Our Lord, John Cleese\" and on the members of Python, who, in the sketch, are the objects of Britain's true religious faith. This was a parody of the infamous \"Friday Night, Saturday Morning\" programme, broadcast a week previously. The bishop (played by Rowan Atkinson) claims that the reaction to the film has surprised him, as he \"didn't expect the Spanish Inquisition.\"\nRadio host John Williams of Chicago's WGN 720 AM has used \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" in a segment of his Friday shows. The segment is used to highlight good events from the past week in listeners' lives and what has made them smile. In the 1997 film \"As Good as It Gets\", the misanthropic character played by Jack Nicholson sings \"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\" as evidence of the character's change in attitude.\nA BBC history series \"What the Romans Did for Us\", written and presented by Adam Hart-Davis and broadcast in 2000, takes its title from Cleese's rhetorical question \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\" in one of the film's scenes. (Cleese himself parodied this line in a 1986 BBC advert defending the Television Licence Fee: \"What has the BBC ever given us?\").\nFormer British Prime Minister Tony Blair in his Prime Minister's Questions of 3 May 2006 made a shorthand reference to the types of political groups, \"Judean People's Front\" or \"People's Front of Judea\", lampooned in \"Life of Brian\". This was in response to a question from the Labour MP David Clelland, asking \"What has the Labour government ever done for us?\" \u2013 itself a parody of John Cleese's \"What have the Romans ever done for us?\"\nOn New Year's Day 2007, and again on New Year's Eve, UK television station Channel 4 dedicated an entire evening to the Monty Python phenomenon, during which an hour-long documentary was broadcast called \"The Secret Life of Brian\" about the making of \"The Life of Brian\" and the controversy that was caused by its release. The Pythons featured in the documentary and reflected upon the events that surrounded the film. This was followed by a screening of the film itself. The documentary (in a slightly extended form) was one of the special features on the 2007 DVD re-release \u2013 the \"Immaculate Edition\", also the first Python release on Blu-ray.\nMost recently, in June 2014 King's College London hosted an academic conference on the film, in which internationally renowned Biblical scholars and historians discussed the film and its reception, looking both at how the Pythons had made use of scholarship and texts, and how the film can be used creatively within modern scholarship on the Historical Jesus. In a panel discussion, including Terry Jones and theologian Richard Burridge, John Cleese described the event as \"the most interesting thing to come out of Monty Python\". The papers from the conference have gone on to prompt the publication of a book, edited by Joan E. Taylor, the conference organiser, \"Jesus and Brian: Exploring the Historical Jesus and His Times via Monty Python's Life of Brian\", published by Bloomsbury in 2015."}
{"title": "Superman_(1978_film)", "label": "Film", "text": "Superman (stylized as Superman: The Movie) is a 1978 epic superhero film directed by Richard Donner, supervised by Alexander and Ilya Salkind, produced by their partner Pierre Spengler, written by Mario Puzo, David Newman, Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton from a story by Puzo based on the DC Comics character of the same name. It is the first installment in the \"Superman\" film series. An international co-production between the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Panama and the United States, the film stars an ensemble cast featuring Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Christopher Reeve, Jeff East, Margot Kidder, Glenn Ford, Phyllis Thaxter, Jackie Cooper, Trevor Howard, Marc McClure, Terence Stamp, Valerie Perrine, Ned Beatty, Jack O'Halloran, Maria Schell, and Sarah Douglas. It depicts the origin of Superman (Reeve), including his infancy as Kal-El of Krypton, son of Jor-El (Brando) and his youthful years in the rural town of Smallville. Disguised as reporter Clark Kent, he adopts a mild-mannered disposition in Metropolis and develops a romance with Lois Lane (Kidder) whilst battling the villainous Lex Luthor (Hackman).\nIlya had the idea of a Superman film in 1973 and after a difficult process with DC Comics, the Salkinds and Spengler bought the rights to the character the following year. Several directors, most notably Guy Hamilton, and screenwriters (Mario Puzo, David and Leslie Newman, and Robert Benton), were associated with the project before Richard Donner was hired to direct. Tom Mankiewicz was drafted in to rewrite the script and was given a \"creative consultant\" credit. It was decided to film both \"Superman\" and its sequel \"Superman II\" (1980) simultaneously, with principal photography beginning in March 1977 and ending in October 1978. Tensions arose between Donner and the producers, and a decision was made to stop filming the sequel, of which 75 percent had already been completed, and finish the first film.\nThe most expensive film made up to that point, with a budget of $55\u00a0million, \"Superman\" was released in December 1978 to critical and financial success; its worldwide box office earnings of $300\u00a0million made it the second-highest-grossing release of the year. It received praise for Reeve's performance and John Williams' musical score, and was nominated for three Academy Awards, including Best Film Editing, Best Music (Original Score), and Best Sound, and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for Visual Effects. Groundbreaking in its use of special effects and science fiction/fantasy storytelling, the film's legacy presaged the mainstream popularity of Hollywood's superhero film franchises. In 2017, \"Superman\" was selected for preservation by the Library of Congress's National Film Registry.\nPlot.\nOn the planet Krypton, Jor-El of the Kryptonian high council discovers that the planet will be destroyed when it drifts out of its orbit towards its red supergiant sun. The other council members dismiss his claims. To save Kal-El, his infant son, Jor-El sends him in a spaceship to Earth, where his dense molecular structure will give him superhuman strength and other powers. Krypton, thereafter, is destroyed.\nThe ship lands near Smallville, Kansas. Kal-El, now three Earth years old, is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are astonished when he lifts their truck. They decide to raise him as their own, naming him Clark after Martha's maiden name. Jonathan tells the boy that he must have been sent to Earth for \"a reason\".\nAfter Jonathan's death from a heart attack, 18-year-old Clark hears a psychic \"call\" and discovers a glowing green crystal in the remains of his spacecraft. It compels him to travel to the Arctic where a Fortress of Solitude, resembling the architecture of Krypton, emerges from the ice. Inside, a hologram of Jor-El explains Clark's true origins, and after twelve years of educating him on his reason for being sent to Earth and his powers, he leaves the Fortress wearing a blue and red suit with a red cape and the House of El family crest emblazoned on his chest. Becoming a reporter at the \"Daily Planet\" in Metropolis, Clark meets and develops a romantic attraction to coworker Lois Lane.\nLois is involved in a helicopter mishap. Clark publicly uses his powers for the first time to save her, astonishing the crowd gathered below. He then thwarts a jewel thief attempting to scale the Solow Building, captures robbers fleeing police and depositing their getaway cabin cruiser on Wall Street, rescues a girl's cat from a tree, and saves Air Force One after a lightning strike destroys an engine. The \"caped wonder\", an instant celebrity, visits Lois at her penthouse apartment the next night and takes her for a flight, allowing her to interview him for an article in which she names him \"Superman\".\nMeanwhile, criminal genius Lex Luthor learns of a joint U.S. Army and U.S. Navy nuclear missile test. He buys hundreds of acres of worthless desert land and reprograms the two missiles to detonate in the San Andreas Fault, with his assistant Otis accidentally programming the second missile coordinates. Knowing Superman could stop his plan, Lex deduces that a recently discovered meteorite is from Krypton and is radioactive to Superman. After he and his accomplices Otis and Eve Teschmacher retrieve a piece of it, Luthor lures Superman to his underground lair and reveals his plan to cause everything west of the San Andreas Fault to sink into the Pacific Ocean, leaving Luthor's desert land as the new West Coast of the United States. Luthor then exposes him to the meteor piece's mineral, Kryptonite, which weakens Superman greatly as Luthor taunts him about the second missile which will detonate in Hackensack, New Jersey.\nTeschmacher is horrified that Luthor does not care that her mother lives in Hackensack. Luthor leaves Superman to die. Knowing he always keeps his word, Teschmacher helps Superman on the condition he will stop the eastbound missile first. After being freed, Superman diverts the eastbound missile into outer space, consequently preventing him from reaching the westbound missile before it explodes in the San Andreas Fault. Massive earthquakes erupt across California, damaging the Golden Gate Bridge and breaching the Hoover Dam. Superman mitigates the effects of the explosion by sealing the fault line.\nWhile Superman is busy saving others, Lois's car falls into a crevice from one of the aftershocks, trapping her as it fills with dirt and debris. She suffocates before Superman can reach her. Angered over failing to save her, Superman defies Jor-El's earlier warning not to manipulate human history, and instead heeds Jonathan's advice that he must be there for \"a reason\". He accelerates around Earth, traveling several minutes backward in time to prevent Lois's death while also undoing the damage caused by the missile and earthquake. After saving the West Coast, Superman delivers Luthor and Otis to prison before flying into the sunrise for further adventures.\nCast.\nKirk Alyn and Noel Neill have cameo appearances as the parents of Lois Lane in a deleted scene that was restored in later home media releases. Alyn and Neill portrayed Superman and Lois Lane in the film serials \"Superman\" (1948) and \"Atom Man vs. Superman\" (1950), and were the first actors to portray the characters onscreen in a live-action format. Neill reprised her role in the 1950s \"Adventures of Superman\" TV series.\nLarry Hagman and Rex Reed also make cameos; Hagman plays an army major in charge of a convoy that is transporting one of the missiles, and Reed plays himself as he meets Lois and Clark outside the \"Daily Planet\" headquarters.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIlya Salkind had first conceived the idea for a Superman film in late 1973. In November 1974, after a long, difficult process with DC Comics, the Superman film rights were purchased by Ilya, his father Alexander Salkind, and their partner Pierre Spengler. DC wanted a list of actors that were to be considered for Superman, and approved the producer's choices of Muhammad Ali, Al Pacino, James Caan, Steve McQueen, Clint Eastwood and Dustin Hoffman. The filmmakers felt it was best to film \"Superman\" and \"Superman II\" back-to-back, and to make a negative pickup deal with Warner Bros. William Goldman was approached to write the screenplay, while Leigh Brackett was considered. Ilya hired Alfred Bester, who began writing a film treatment. Alexander felt, however, that Bester was not famous enough, so he hired Mario Puzo to write the screenplay at a $600,000 salary. Francis Ford Coppola, William Friedkin, Richard Lester (who later directed Superman II and III), Peter Yates, John Guillermin, Ronald Neame and Sam Peckinpah were in negotiations to direct. Peckinpah dropped out when he produced a gun during a meeting with Ilya. George Lucas turned down the offer because of his commitment to \"Star Wars\".\nIlya wanted to hire Steven Spielberg to direct, but Alexander was skeptical, feeling it was best to \"wait until [Spielberg's] big fish opens.\" \"Jaws\" was very successful, prompting the producers to offer Spielberg the position, but by then Spielberg had already committed to \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\". Guy Hamilton was hired as director, while Puzo delivered his 500-page script for \"Superman\" and \"Superman II\" in July 1975. Jax-Ur appeared as one of General Zod's henchmen, with Clark Kent written as a television reporter. Dustin Hoffman, who was previously considered for Superman, turned down Lex Luthor.\nIn early 1975, Brando signed on as Jor-El with a salary of $3.7\u00a0million and 11.75% of the box office gross profits, totaling $19\u00a0million. He horrified Salkind by proposing in their first meeting that Jor-El appear as a green suitcase or a bagel with Brando's voice, but Donner used flattery to persuade the actor to portray Jor-El himself. Brando hoped to use some of his salary for a proposed 13-part \"Roots\"-style miniseries on Native Americans in the United States. Brando had it in his contract to complete all of his scenes in twelve days. He also refused to memorize his dialogue, so cue cards were compiled across the set. Fellow Oscar winner Hackman was cast as Lex Luthor days later. The filmmakers made it a priority to shoot all of Brando's and Hackman's footage \"because they would be committed to other films immediately.\" Though the Salkinds felt that Puzo had written a solid story for the two-part film, they deemed his scripts too long and so hired Robert Benton and David Newman for rewrite work. Benton became too busy directing \"The Late Show\", so David's wife Leslie was brought in to help her husband finish writing duties. George MacDonald Fraser was later hired to do some work on the script, but he says he did little.\nTheir script was submitted in July 1976, and had a camp tone, including a cameo appearance by Telly Savalas as his \"Kojak\" character. The scripts for \"Superman\" and \"Superman II\" were now at over 400 pages combined. Pre-production started at Cinecitt\u00e0 Studios in Rome, with sets starting construction and flying tests being unsuccessfully experimented. \"In Italy\", producer Ilya Salkind remembered, \"we lost about $2\u00a0million [on flying tests].\" Marlon Brando found out he could not film in Italy because of a warrant out for his arrest: a sexual-obscenity charge from \"Last Tango in Paris\". Production moved to England in late 1976, but Hamilton could not join because he was a tax exile.\nMark Robson was strongly considered and was in talks to direct, but after seeing \"The Omen\", the producers hired Richard Donner. Donner had previously been planning \"\" when he was hired in January 1977 for $1\u00a0million to direct \"Superman\" and \"Superman II\". Donner felt it was best to start from scratch. \"They had prepared the picture for a year and not one bit was useful to me.\" Donner was dissatisfied with the campy script and brought in Tom Mankiewicz to perform a rewrite. According to Mankiewicz, \"not a word from the Puzo script was used.\" \"It was a well-written, but still a ridiculous script. It was 550 pages. I said, 'You can't shoot this screenplay because you'll be shooting for five years'\", Donner continued. \"That was literally a shooting script and they planned to shoot all 550 pages. You know, 110 pages is plenty for a script, so even for two features, that was way too much.\" Mankiewicz conceived having each Kryptonian family wear a crest resembling a different letter, justifying the 'S' on Superman's costume. The Writers Guild of America refused to credit Mankiewicz for his rewrites, so Donner gave him a creative consultant credit, much to the annoyance of the Guild.\nCasting of Superman.\nIt was initially decided to first sign an A-list actor for Superman before Richard Donner was hired as director. Robert Redford was offered a large sum, but felt he was too famous. Burt Reynolds also turned down the role, while Sylvester Stallone was interested, but nothing ever came of it. Paul Newman was offered his choice of roles as Superman, Lex Luthor or Jor-El for $4\u00a0million, turning down all three roles.\nWhen it was next decided to cast an unknown actor, casting director Lynn Stalmaster first suggested Christopher Reeve, but Donner and the producers felt he was too young and skinny. Over 200 unknown actors auditioned for Superman.\nOlympic champion Bruce Jenner auditioned for the title role. Patrick Wayne was cast, but dropped out when his father John Wayne was diagnosed with stomach cancer.\nBoth Neil Diamond and Arnold Schwarzenegger lobbied hard for the role, but were ignored. James Caan, James Brolin, Lyle Waggoner, Christopher Walken, Nick Nolte, Jon Voight, and Perry King were approached. Kris Kristofferson and Charles Bronson were also considered for the title role. Warren Beatty was offered the role but turned it down.\nJames Caan said he was offered the part but turned it down. \"I just couldn't wear that suit.\"\n\"We found guys with fabulous physique who couldn't act or wonderful actors who did not look remotely like Superman\", creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz remembered. The search became so desperate that producer Ilya Salkind's wife's dentist was screen tested.\nStalmaster convinced Donner and Ilya to have Reeve screen test in February 1977. Reeve stunned the director and producers, but he was told to wear a \"muscle suit\" to produce the desired muscular physique. Reeve refused, undertaking a strict physical exercise regime headed by David Prowse. Prowse had wanted to portray Superman, but was denied an audition by the filmmakers because he was not American. Prowse also auditioned for Non. Reeve went from 188 to 212 pounds during pre-production and filming. Reeve was paid a mere $250,000 for both \"Superman\" and \"Superman II\", while his veteran co-stars received huge sums of money: $3.7\u00a0million for Brando and $2\u00a0million for Hackman for \"Superman I\". However, Reeve felt, \"'Superman' brought me many opportunities, rather than closing a door in my face.\" Jeff East portrays teenage Clark Kent. East's lines were overdubbed by Reeve during post-production. \"I was not happy about it because the producers never told me what they had in mind\", East commented. \"It was done without my permission but it turned out to be okay. Chris did a good job but it caused tension between us. We resolved our issues with each other years later.\" East also tore several thigh muscles when performing the stunt of racing alongside the train. He applied 3 to 4 hours of prosthetic makeup daily to facially resemble Reeve.\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography began on March 28, 1977 at Pinewood Studios for Krypton scenes, budgeted as the most expensive film ever made at that point. Since \"Superman\" was being shot simultaneously with \"Superman II\", filming lasted nineteen months, until October 1978. Filming was originally scheduled to last between seven and eight months, but problems arose during production. John Barry served as production designer, while Stuart Craig and Norman Reynolds worked as art directors. Derek Meddings and Les Bowie were credited as visual effects supervisors. Stuart Freeborn was the make-up artist, while Barry, David Tomblin, John Glen, David Lane, Robert Lynn and an uncredited Peter Duffell and Andr\u00e9 de Toth directed second unit scenes. Vic Armstrong was hired as the stunt coordinator and Reeve's stunt double; his wife Wendy Leech was Kidder's double. \"Superman\" was also the final complete film by cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth, who died during post-production while working on \"Tess\" for director Roman Polanski. The Fortress of Solitude was constructed at Shepperton Studios and at Pinewood's 007 Stage. Upon viewing the footage of Krypton, Warner Bros. decided to distribute in not only North America, but also in foreign countries. Due to complications and problems during filming, Warner Bros. also supplied $20\u00a0million and acquired television rights.\nNew York City doubled for Metropolis, while the \"New York Daily News\" Building served as the location for the offices of the \"Daily Planet\". Brooklyn Heights was also used. Filming in New York lasted five weeks, during the time of the New York City blackout of 1977. Production moved to Alberta for scenes set in Smallville, with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of Beynon, Alberta, the high school football scenes at Barons, Alberta, and the Kent farm constructed at Blackie, Alberta. Brief filming also took place in Gallup, New Mexico; Lake Mead; and Grand Central Terminal. Director Donner had tensions with the Salkinds and Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule. Creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz reflected, \"Donner never got a budget or a schedule. He was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget. At one point he said, 'Why don't you just schedule the film for the next two days, and then I'll be nine months over?'.\" Richard Lester, who worked with the Salkinds on \"The Three Musketeers\" and \"The Four Musketeers\", was then brought in as a temporary co-producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds, who by now were refusing to talk to each other. With his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, \"At one time if I'd seen him, I would have killed him.\"\nLester was offered producing credit but refused, going uncredited for his work. Salkind felt that bringing a second director onto the set meant there would be someone ready in the event that Donner could not fulfill his directing duties. \"Being there all the time meant he [Lester] could take over\", Salkind admitted. \"[Donner] couldn't make up his mind on stuff.\" On Lester, Donner reflected, \"He'd been suing the Salkinds for his money on \"Three\" and \"Four Musketeers\", which he'd never gotten. He won a lot of his lawsuits, but each time he sued the Salkinds in one country, they'd move to another, from Costa Rica to Panama to Switzerland. When I was hired, Lester told me, 'Don't do it. Don't work for them. I was told not to, but I did it. Now I'm telling you not to, but you'll probably do it and end up telling the next guy.' Lester came in as a 'go-between'. I didn't trust Lester, and I told him. He said, 'Believe me, I'm only doing it because they're paying me the money that they owe me from the lawsuit. I'll never come onto your set unless you ask me; I'll never go to your dailies. If I can help you in any way, call me.\"\nIt was decided to stop shooting \"Superman II\" and focus on finishing \"Superman\". Donner had already completed 75% of the sequel. The filmmakers took a risk: if \"Superman\" was a box office bomb, they would not finish \"Superman II\". The original climax for \"Superman II\" had General Zod, Ursa, and Non destroying the planet, with Superman time traveling to fix the damage.\nDonner commented, \"I decided if \"Superman\" is a success, they're going to do a sequel. If it ain't a success, a cliffhanger ain't gonna bring them to see \"Superman II\".\"\nEffects.\n\"Superman\" contains large-scale visual effects sequences. The Golden Gate Bridge scale model stood 70 feet long and 20 feet wide. Other miniatures included the Krypton Council Dome and the Hoover Dam. Slow motion was used to simulate the vast amount of water for the Hoover Dam destruction. The Fortress of Solitude was a combination of a full-scale set and matte paintings. The car crashes on the Golden Gate Bridge were a mixture of models and stunt drivers on a disused runway. Young Clark Kent's long-distance football punt was executed with a wooden football loaded into an air blaster placed in the ground. The Superman costume was to be a much darker blue, but the use of blue screen made it transparent.\nAs detailed in the \"Superman: The Movie\" DVD special effects documentary 'The Magic Behind The Cape', presented by optical effects supervisor Roy Field, in the end, three techniques were used to achieve the flying effects.\nFor landings and take-offs, wire flying riggings were devised and used. On location, these were suspended from tower cranes, whereas in the studio elaborate rigs were suspended from the studio ceilings. Some of the wire-flying work was quite audacious\u2014the penultimate shot where Superman flies out of the prison yard, for example. Although stuntmen were used, Reeve did much of the work himself, and was suspended as high as 50\u00a0feet in the air. Counterweights and pulleys were typically used to achieve flying movement, rather than electronic or motorized devices. The thin wires used to suspend Reeve were typically removed from the film in post-production using rotoscope techniques, although this wasn't necessary in all shots (in certain lighting conditions or when Superman is very distant in the frame, the wires were more or less imperceptible).\nFor stationary shots where Superman is seen flying toward or away from the camera, blue screen matte techniques were used. Reeve would be photographed suspended against a blue screen. While a special device made his cape flap to give the illusion of movement, the actor himself would remain stationary (save for banking his body). Instead, the camera would use a mixture of long zoom-ins and zoom-outs and dolly in/dolly outs to cause him to become larger or smaller in the frame. The blue background would then be photochemically removed and Reeve's isolated image would be 'inserted' into a matted area of a background plate shot. The zoom-ins or zoom-outs would give the appearance of flying away or toward the contents of the background plate. The disparity in lighting and color between the matted image and the background plate, the occasional presence of black matte lines (where the matte area and the matted image\u2014in this case, Superman\u2014do not exactly match up), and the slightly unconvincing impression of movement achieved through the use of zoom lenses is characteristic of these shots.\nWhere the shot is tracking with Superman as he flies (such as in the Superman and Lois Metropolis flying sequence), front projection was used. This involved photographing the actors suspended in front of a background image dimly projected from the front onto a special screen made by 3M that would reflect light back directly into a combined camera/projector. The result was a very clear and intense photographic reproduction of both the actors and the background plate, with far less image deterioration or lighting problems than occur with rear projection.\nA technique was developed that combined the front projection effect with specially designed zoom lenses. The illusion of movement was created by zooming in on Reeve while making the front projected image appear to recede. For scenes where Superman interacts with other people or objects while in flight, Reeve and actors were put in a variety of rigging equipment with careful lighting and photography. This also led to the creation of the Zoptic system.\nThe highly reflective costumes worn by the Kryptonians are made of the same 3M material used for the front projection screens and were the result of an accident during Superman flying tests. \"We noticed the material lit up on its own\", Donner explained. \"We tore the material into tiny pieces and glued it on the costumes, designing a front projection effect for each camera. There was a little light on each camera, and it would project into a mirror, bounce out in front of the lens, hit the costume, [and] millions of little glass beads would light up and bring the image back into the camera.\"\nMusic.\nJerry Goldsmith, who scored Donner's \"The Omen\", was originally set to compose \"Superman\". Portions of Jerry Goldsmith's work from \"Planet of the Apes\" were used in \"Superman\"'s teaser trailer. He dropped out over scheduling conflicts, and John Williams was hired. Williams conducted the London Symphony Orchestra to record the soundtrack. The music was one of the last pieces to come into place. Williams' \"Theme from Superman (Main Title)\" was released as a single, reaching #81 on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 and #69 \"Cash Box\". Williams liked that the film did not take itself too seriously and that it had a theatrical camp feel to it.\nKidder was supposed to sing \"Can You Read My Mind?\", the lyrics to which were written by Leslie Bricusse, but Donner disliked it and changed it to a composition accompanied by a voiceover. Maureen McGovern eventually recorded the single, \"Can You Read My Mind?\" in 1979, although the song did not appear on the film soundtrack. It became a mid-chart hit on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100 that year (#52), spending three weeks at number five on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart, as well as making lesser appearances on the corresponding Canadian charts. It was also a very minor hit on the U.S. Country chart, reaching #93. Both Williams' and McGovern's singles contained theme music from the score. The score earned John Williams an Academy Award nomination, but he lost to Giorgio Moroder's score for \"Midnight Express\".\nLa-La Land Records released the fully expanded restoration of Williams' score as part of the film's 40th anniversary in February 2019.\n * Previously unreleased selection\n ** Contains previously unreleased material\nThemes.\n\"Superman\" is divided into three basic sections, each having a distinct theme and visual style. The first segment, set on Krypton, is meant to be typical of science fiction films, but also lays the groundwork for an analogy that emerges in the relationship between Jor-El and Kal-El. The second segment, set in Smallville, is reminiscent of 1950s films, and its small-town atmosphere is meant to evoke a Norman Rockwell painting. The third (and largest) segment, set mostly in Metropolis, was an attempt to present the superhero story with as much realism as possible (what Donner called \"verisimilitude\"), relying on traditional cinematic drama and using only subtle humor instead of a campy approach.\nIn each of the three acts, the mythic status of Superman is enhanced by events that recall the hero's journey (or monomyth) as described by Joseph Campbell. Each act has a discernible cycle of \"call\" and journey. The journey is from Krypton to Earth in the first act, from Smallville to the Fortress of Solitude in the second act, and then from Metropolis to the whole world in the third act.\nMany have noted the examples of apparent Christian symbolism. Donner, Tom Mankiewicz and Ilya Salkind have commented on the use of Christian references to discuss the themes of \"Superman\". Mankiewicz deliberately fostered analogies with Jor-El (God) and Kal-El (Jesus). Donner is somewhat skeptical of Mankiewicz' actions, joking \"I got enough death threats because of that.\"\nSeveral concepts and items of imagery have been used in Biblical comparisons. Jor-El casts out General Zod from Krypton, a parallel to the casting out of Satan from Heaven. The spacecraft that brings Kal-El to Earth is in the form of a star (Star of Bethlehem). Kal-El comes to Jonathan and Martha Kent, who are unable to have children. Martha Kent states, \"All these years how we've prayed and prayed that the good Lord would see fit to give us a child\", which was compared to the Virgin Mary.\nJust as little is known about Jesus during his middle years, Clark travels into the wilderness to find out who he is and what he has to do. Jor-El says, \"Live as one of them, Kal-El, to discover where your strength and power are needed. But always hold in your heart the pride of your special heritage. They can be a great people, Kal-El, and they wish to be. They only lack the light to show the way. For this reason above all, their capacity for good, I have sent them you, my only son.\" The theme resembles the Biblical account of God sending his only son Jesus to Earth in hope for the good of mankind. More were seen when Donner was able to complete \"\", featuring the fall, resurrection and his battle with evil. Another vision was that of \"The Creation of Adam\".\nThe Christian imagery in the Reeve films has provoked comment on the Jewish origins of Superman. Rabbi Simcha Weinstein's book \"Up, Up and Oy Vey: How Jewish History, Culture and Values Shaped the Comic Book Superhero\", says that Superman is both a pillar of society and one whose cape conceals a \"nebbish\", saying \"He's a bumbling, nebbish Jewish stereotype. He's Woody Allen.\" Ironically, it is also in the Reeve films that Clark Kent's persona has the greatest resemblance to Woody Allen, though his conscious model was Cary Grant's character in \"Bringing Up Baby\". This same theme is pursued about 1940s superheroes generally in \"Disguised as Clark Kent: Jews, Comics, and the Creation of the Superhero\" by Danny Fingeroth.\nIn the scene where Lois Lane interviews Superman on the balcony, Superman replies, \"I never lie.\" Salkind felt this was an important point in the film, since Superman, living under his secret identity as Clark Kent, is \"telling the biggest lie of all time.\" His romance with Lois also leads him to contradict Jor-El's orders to avoid altering human history, time traveling to save her from dying. Superman instead takes the advice of Jonathan Kent, his father on Earth.\nRelease.\n\"Superman\" was originally scheduled to be released in June 1978, the 40th anniversary of \"Action Comics 1\", which first introduced Superman, but the problems during filming pushed the film back by six months. Editor Stuart Baird reflected, \"Filming was finished in October 1978 and it is a miracle we had the film released two months later. Big-budgeted films today tend to take six to eight months.\" Donner, for his part, wished that he had \"had another six months; I would have perfected a lot of things. But at some point, you've gotta turn the picture over.\"\nWarner Bros. Pictures spent $6\u20137\u00a0million on marketing the film. \"Superman\" premiered at the Uptown Theater in Washington, D.C. on December 10, 1978, with director Richard Donner and several cast members in attendance. Three days later, on December 13, it had a European Royal Charity Premiere at the Empire, Leicester Square in London in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Andrew.\nReception.\nBox office.\nThe film set a new all-time U.S. industry record for business during a pre-Christmas week with $12 million, and set new records for Warner Bros. for their best opening day ($2.8 million) and three-day weekend ($7.5 million). In the week of December 22\u201328, it set an all-time U.S. weekly record of $18.5 million. It also set a record single day gross for Warner Bros. with a gross of $3.8 million. In its third weekend it grossed $13.1 million for the four day holiday weekend setting a record 18 day gross of $43.7 million.\nIt went on to gross $134.21\u00a0million in the United States and Canada, and $166\u00a0million internationally, totaling $300.21\u00a0million worldwide. \"Superman\" was the highest-grossing film of 1978 in North America, and became the sixth-highest-grossing film of all time after its theatrical run. It was also Warner Bros.'s most successful film at the time.\nCritical response.\nAccording to Rotten Tomatoes, 94% of 69 critics gave \"Superman\" a positive review, with an average rating of 8.1/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \"\"Superman\" deftly blends humor and gravitas, taking advantage of the perfectly cast Reeve to craft a loving, nostalgic tribute to an American pop culture icon.\" Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 81 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". The film was widely regarded as one of top 10 films of 1978. \"Superman\" creators Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster gave a positive reaction. Shuster was \"delighted to see Superman on the screen. I got chills. Chris Reeve has just the right touch of humor. He really is Superman.\"\nRoger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars. Although describing the Krypton scenes as \"ponderous\" (\"Brando was allegedly paid $3 million for his role, or, judging by his dialogue, $500,000 a clich\u00e9\"), Ebert wrote that \"\"Superman\" is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects, and -- you know what else? Wit\". He praised Reeve, stating that he \"sells the role; wrong casting here would have sunk everything\", and concluded that the film \"works so well because of its wit and its special effects\". Ebert placed the film on his ten best list of 1978. He would later go on to place it on his \"Great Movies\" list. Gene Siskel gave the film three stars out of four, calling it \"a delightful mess. Good performances. Sloppy editing. Cheap nonflying special effects. Funny dialog. In sum, 'Superman' is the kind of picture critics tear apart, but still say, 'You ought to see it.\nJames Harwood of \"Variety\" called the film \"a wonderful, chuckling, preposterously exciting fantasy\", and further added: \"As both the wholesome man of steel and his bumbling secret identity Clark Kent, Reeve is excellent.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote in a mixed review, \"The Superman comic strip has been carefully, elaborately, sometimes wittily blown up for the big-theater screen, which, though busy, often seems sort of empty.\" Charles Champlin of the \"Los Angeles Times\" called the film \"a big letdown\", praising Reeve as \"the salvaging strength of the film\" but referring to the matter of the villain as \"an essential problem\", finding that \"even in a succession of wigs, Gene Hackman is not preposterous, funny or dementedly menacing, and what he's doing here is not evident.\" Gary Arnold of \"The Washington Post\" wrote in a positive review, \"Despite a lull here and a lapse there, this superproduction turns out to be prodigiously inventive and enjoyable, doubly blessed by sophisticated illusionists behind the cameras and a brilliant new stellar personality in front of the cameras\u2014Christopher Reeve, a young actor at once handsome and astute enough to rationalize the preposterous fancy of a comic-book superhero in the flesh.\" Dave Kehr of \"Chicago Reader\" felt \"the tone, style, and point of view change almost from shot to shot. This is the definitive corporate film. It is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp. When Lex Luthor enters the action, Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit.\"\nWriting in a retrospective review, James Berardinelli believed \"there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's one of the most wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, is the message at the end of the credits announcing the impending arrival of \"Superman II\".\" Harry Knowles is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that did not represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics. Neal Gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy. He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo's original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as \"simply puffed-up TV episodes.\"\nAccolades.\n\"Superman\" was nominated for three Academy Awards: Best Film Editing (Stuart Baird), Best Original Score (John Williams) and Best Sound (Gordon K. McCallum, Graham V. Hartstone, Nicolas Le Messurier and Roy Charman) and received a Special Achievement Academy Award for its visual effects. Donner publicly expressed disgust that production designer John Barry and cinematographer Geoffrey Unsworth had not been recognized by the Academy.\n\"Superman\" was also successful at the 32nd British Academy Film Awards. Reeve won Best Newcomer, while Hackman, Unsworth, Barry, and the sound designers earned nominations. The film won the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. At the Saturn Awards, Kidder, Barry, John Williams, and the visual effects department received awards, and the film won Best Science Fiction Film. Reeve, Hackman, Donner, Valerie Perrine, and costume designer Yvonne Blake were nominated for their work as well. In addition, Williams was nominated at the 36th Golden Globe Awards and won the Grammy Award for Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media.\nTelevision and home media.\nThe extended TV version.\nWhile, by contract, Richard Donner had major editorial control over what was theatrically released, the Salkinds had editorial control on what was shown outside of theaters. This was the result of deals that had been made between the producers and the ABC television network prior to the film's release. Financially, the more footage that was restored for television, the more revenue that could be made for the broadcast (the producers charged by the minute for every bit of footage added back in). During production of the film, Alexander and Ilya Salkind had been relegated to having to sell more and more of their rights back to Warner Bros. in exchange for financial help, which is why Warner Bros. would have theatrical and home video distribution rights. So by 1981, when the television rights reverted to the Salkinds, the producers had already prepared a 3-hour-and-8-minute version that actually had been the first version of the film visually locked down prior to being re-edited for theatrical release. This extended cut, which would be utilized for worldwide television distribution, reincorporated some 45 minutes of footage and music deleted from the theatrical cut. Networks and stations could then re-edit their own version at their discretion. This edit is commonly known as the \"Salkind International Television Cut\".\nABC aired the broadcast television debut of \"Superman\" over two nights in February 1982, with a majority of the unused footage. The 182-minute network cut (which was slightly cut down for content) was repeated in November of that same year, this time in its entirety in one evening. The remaining two ABC broadcasts were presented in its original theatrical version.\nWhen the TV rights reverted to Warner Bros. in 1985, CBS aired the film one last time on network television in its theatrical version. When the movie entered the syndication market in 1988 (following a play-out run on pay cable) TV stations were offered the extended cut or the theatrical cut. The stations that showed the extended cut edited the second half to add more advertising time and \"previously on...\" cutback scenes just as ABC had done in 1982.\nIn 1994 (following a pay-cable reissue and its obligatory run on USA Network), Warner Bros. Television syndicated the full 188-minute international television version, most famously on Los Angeles station KCOP. The most notable additions unseen on U.S. television were two additional scenes never seen before, in addition to what had been previously reinstated. This version also surfaced outside of Los Angeles. For example, WJLA Channel 7, an ABC affiliate in Washington, D.C., aired the extended cut in July 1994. Because its first known airing was on the aforementioned KCOP, it is also known in fan circles as the \"KCOP Version\".\nThere were various extended TV versions each broadcast in various countries. Most of these are in pan and scan, as they were made in the 1980s, when films were not letterboxed to preserve the theatrical aspect ratio on old TVs.\nUntil 2017, it was thought the quality of the extended network TV version was inferior to any theatrical or previous home video release because it was mastered in 16mm (using the \"film chain system\") and a mono sound mix done, as by the time the extended cut was prepared in 1981, stereo was not available in television broadcasts (16mm television prints were, in fact, made and mastered on NTSC Standard Definition video for the initial ABC network broadcasts). However, during an inventory of the Warner Bros. library, an IP master of the full 188-minute television version was discovered. This eighteen-reel master was not marked with an aspect ratio, but the print was inspected and, as it turned out, was in the proper 2.35:1 Panavision ratio. This was the source of the Warner Archive Collection Blu-Ray release of what would officially be called the \"Superman: The Movie Extended Cut\", issued on October 3, 2017. The video release was visually restored by WB's imaging department, and, other than the opening and end credits (which are in true stereo), the film is presented in an enhanced version of the mono TV sound mix. This particular release also includes another version discussed below.\nRichard Donner was critical of this extended cut of the film. He called this version of the film \"terrible,\" saying it \"was nothing more than an assembly.\" He said he cut the bad material out of the movie and that the producers and Warner Bros. added it back in just \"to make a buck.\"\nOther editions.\nWhen Michael Thau and Warner Home Video started working on a film restoration in 2000, only eight minutes of the added footage that had been used in the TV cut could be considered restored into a version that director Richard Donner called his preferred version of the film. Thau determined that some of the extra footage could not be added because of poor visual effects. Thau felt \"the pace of the film's storyline would be adversely affected [and there were] timing problems matching [footage] with John Williams' musical score, etc\u2026 The cut of the movie shown on KCOP was put together to make the movie longer when shown on TV as the Television Station paid per minute to air the movie. The \"Special Edition\" cut is designed for the best viewing experience in the true spirit of movie making.\" There was a special test screening of the Special Edition in 2001 in Austin, Texas, on March 23 with plans for a possible wider theatrical release later that year, which did not occur. In May 2001, Warner Home Video released the special edition on DVD. Director Donner also assisted, working slightly over a year on the project. The release included making-of documentaries directed by Thau and eight minutes of restored footage.\nThau explained, \"I worked on \"Ladyhawke\" and that's how I really met Dick [Donner] and Tom Mankiewicz. I used to hear those wonderful stories in the cutting room that Tom and Dick and Stuart would tell about \"Superman\" and that's how I kind of got the ideas for the plots of 'Taking Flight' and 'Making Superman'\". Donner commented, \"There are a few shots where Chris [Reeve]'s costume looked green. We went in and cleaned that up, bringing the color back to where it should be.\" Thau wanted to make the film shorter: \"I wanted to take out the damn poem where Lois is reciting a poem (\"Can You Read My Mind\") when they're flying around. I also wanted to take out a lot of that car chase where it was just generic action... It was like a two-minute car chase. But Dick didn't want to take [that] out [or] the poem.\" It was followed by a box set release in the same month, containing \"bare bones\" editions of \"Superman II\", \"Superman III\", and \"Superman IV: The Quest for Peace\". In November 2006, a four-disc special edition was released, followed by an HD DVD release and Blu-ray. Also available (with other films) is the nine-disc \"Christopher Reeve Superman Collection\" and the 14-disc \"Superman Ultimate Collector's Edition.\"\nOn November 6, 2018 (following year-long worldwide revival theatrical screenings to commemorate the 40th anniversary of the film's original release), Warner Bros. Home Entertainment released an Ultra HD Blu-ray of \"Superman\" presented in a new Dolby Vision transfer of the original theatrical version straight from the original camera negative, with its original 70mm/six-track stereo mix rendered in 5.1 surround, in addition to the 2000 remix in Dolby Atmos. This new release also includes a standard Blu-Ray of the theatrical cut, plus select bonus features carried over from previous video releases, and digital copies of both the theatrical and three-hour TV versions.\nLegacy.\nIn 2007, the Visual Effects Society listed \"Superman\" as the 44th-most influential use of visual effects of all time. In 2008, \"Empire\" magazine named it the 174th-greatest film of all time on its list of 500. In 2009, \"Entertainment Weekly\" ranked Superman 3rd on their list of \"The All-Time Coolest Heroes in Pop Culture\".\nWith the film's success, it was immediately decided to finish \"Superman II\". Ilya and Alexander Salkind and Pierre Spengler did not ask Donner to return because Donner had criticized them during the film's publicity phase. Donner commented in January 1979, \"I'd work with Spengler again, but only on my terms. As long as he has nothing to say as the producer, and is just liaison between Alexander Salkind and his money, that's fine. If they don't want it on those terms, then they need to go out and find another director, it sure as shit ain't gonna be me.\" Kidder, who portrayed Lois Lane, was dissatisfied by the producers' decision, and also criticized the Salkinds during publicity. Kidder said that as a result, she was only given a cameo appearance for \"Superman III\", and not a main supporting role. Jack O'Halloran, who portrayed Non, stated, \"It was great to work with Donner. Richard Lester was as big an asshole as the Salkinds.\" Two more films, \"Superman III\" (1983) and \"\" (1987), were produced. Donner's vision for \"Superman II\" was eventually realized nearly three decades later, when he supervised the editing of , which was released in 2006. In the same year, Donner and writer Geoff Johns wrote \"Last Son\", a comic book story arc in Action Comics featuring Superman. Unused footage of Marlon Brando as Jor-El, discovered during the restoration of Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut, was used in \"Superman Returns\" (2006).\nBecause \"Superman\" went into production prior to the releases of \"Star Wars\" (May 1977) and \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\" (November 1977), some observers credit the three films collectively for launching the reemergence of a large market for science fiction films\nin the 1980s. This is certainly the view of \"Superman\" producer Ilya Salkind and some who have interviewed him, as well as of film production assistant Brad Lohan. Other observers of film history tend to credit the resurgence of science fiction films simply to the Lucas and Spielberg productions, and see \"Superman\" as the first of the new cycle of films launched by the first two. Ilya Salkind denies any connection between \"Superman\"\u2014which began filming in March 1977\u2014and the other films, stating that \"I did not know about '\"Star Wars\"'; '\"Star Wars\"' did not know about '\"Superman\"'; '\"Close Encounters\"' did not know about \"'Superman\".' It really was completely independent\u2014nobody knew anything about anybody.\" \"Superman\" also established the superhero film genre as viable outside the production of low-budget Saturday matinee serials. Director Christopher Nolan cited Richard Donner's vision and scope of \"Superman\" when pitching the concept for \"Batman Begins\" to Warner Bros. in 2002.\nIn 2021, DC Comics revived the continuity of the 1978 film with their \"Superman '78\" comic book series, emulating the look of the Christopher Reeve films. The strip picks up where the 1978 film left off, thereby acting as a direct sequel.\nThe film inspired The Kinks' 1979 song \"(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman\", when the band's main songwriter, Ray Davies, watched the film in late 1978.\nThe film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:\nIn December 2017, the film was selected for preservation by the United States Library of Congress National Film Registry, for being \"culturally, historically or aesthetically significant\"."}
{"title": "Boys_Don't_Cry_(1999_film)", "label": "Film", "text": "Boys Don't Cry is a 1999 American biographical film directed by Kimberly Peirce, and co-written by Peirce and Andy Bienen. The film is a dramatization of the real-life story of Brandon Teena (played in the film by Hilary Swank), an American trans man who attempts to find himself and love in Nebraska but falls victim to a brutal hate crime perpetrated by two male acquaintances. The film co-stars Chlo\u00eb Sevigny as Teena's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel.\nAfter reading about the case while in college, Peirce conducted extensive research for a screenplay, which she worked on for almost five years. The film focuses on the relationship between Brandon and Lana. The script took dialogue directly from archive footage in the 1998 documentary \"The Brandon Teena Story\". Many actors sought the lead role during a three-year casting process before Swank was cast. Swank was chosen because her personality seemed similar to Brandon's. Most of the film's characters were based on real-life people; others were composites.\nFilming occurred during October and November 1998 in the Dallas, Texas area. The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had to occur in Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced by a variety of styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music. The film's themes include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, especially transgender people, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.\nThe film premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 8, 1999, before appearing at various other film festivals. Distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, the film received a limited release in the United States on October 22, 1999, and it performed well at the North American box office, gaining three times its production budget by May 2000. The film was acclaimed by critics, with many ranking it as one of the best films of the year; praise focused on the lead performances by Swank and Sevigny as well as the film's depiction of its subject matter. However, some people who had been involved with Brandon in real life criticized the film for not portraying the events accurately.\n\"Boys Don't Cry\" was nominated for multiple awards; at the 72nd Academy Awards in 2000, Swank was awarded the Academy Award for Best Actress and Sevigny was nominated for Best Supporting Actress. The pair were also nominated at the 57th Golden Globe Awards, with Swank winning the Best Actress \u2013 Drama award. \"Boys Don't Cry\", which dealt with controversial issues, was initially assigned an NC-17 rating but was later reclassified to an R rating. It was released on home video in September 2000.\nIn 2019, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\nPlot.\nBrandon Teena is a young trans man whose birth name was Teena Renae Brandon. When Brandon is discovered to be transgender by a former girlfriend's brother, he receives death threats. Soon after, he is involved in a bar fight and is evicted from his cousin's trailer. Brandon moves to Falls City, Nebraska, where he befriends ex-convicts John Lotter and Tom Nissen, and their friends Candace and Lana Tisdel. Brandon becomes romantically involved with Lana, who is initially unaware both of his anatomy and his troubled past. The two make plans to move to Memphis, where Brandon will manage Lana's karaoke singing career. Eventually, they kiss during a date night which ends with them having sex.\nThe police detain Brandon on charges that arose prior to his relocation; they place him in the women's section of the Falls City prison. Lana bails Brandon out and asks why he was placed in a women's prison. Brandon attempts to lie to her, saying he was born a hermaphrodite and will soon receive genital reconstruction surgery, but Lana stops him, declaring her love for Brandon regardless of his gender. However, while Brandon is in prison, Candace finds a number of documents listing Brandon's birth name, Teena Brandon, and she and her friends react to this news with shock and disgust. They enter Brandon's room, search among Brandon's things, and discover some transgender literature that confirms their suspicions. Tom and John violently confront Brandon, forcing him to remove his pants and reveal his genitals. They try to make Lana look, but she shields her eyes and turns away. After this confrontation, Tom and John drag Brandon into John's car and drive to an isolated location, where they brutally beat and gang rape him.\nAfterwards, they take Brandon to Tom's house. Though injured, Brandon escapes through a bathroom window. Although his assailants threaten Brandon and warn him not to report the attack to the police, Lana persuades him to do so. However, the police chief proves to be less concerned with the crime than with Brandon's \"sexual identity crisis.\"\nLater, John and Tom get drunk and drive to Candace's house. Lana attempts to stop them, but they find Brandon, who has been hiding in a nearby shed. John shoots Brandon under the chin, killing him instantly. While Candace is crying out to them to spare her baby, Tom shoots her in the head as Lana fights with them, begging them to stop. Tom stabs Brandon's lifeless body. John and Tom flee the scene while a crying Lana lies with Brandon's body and the baby toddles through the open door to the outside, crying. The next morning, Lana awakens next to Brandon's corpse. Her mother arrives and takes her away from the scene. As Lana leaves Falls City, a letter Brandon wrote to her is heard in a voiceover.\nProduction.\nBackground.\nBrandon Teena was a trans man who was gang raped and murdered by a group of male acquaintances in December 1993, when he was 21. Kimberly Peirce, at the time a Columbia University film student, became interested in the case after reading a 1994 \"Village Voice\" article by Donna Minkowitz. Peirce became engrossed in Brandon's life and death; she said, \"the minute I read about Brandon, I fell in love. With the intensity of his desire to turn himself into a boy, the fact that he did it with no role models. The leap of imagination that this person took was completely overwhelming to me.\" The sensationalist news coverage of the case prolonged her interest. Peirce said she looked beyond the brutality of the case and instead viewed the positive aspects of Brandon's life as part of what eventually causes his death. She admired Brandon's audacity, ability to solve complicated problems, and what she perceived as the sense of fantasy invoked by his personality.\nPeirce wanted to tell the story from Brandon's perspective. She was familiar with Brandon's desire to wear men's clothing: \"I started looking at all the other coverage and a great deal of it was sensational. People were focusing on the spectacle of a girl who had passed as a boy because that is so unfamiliar to so many people. Where to me, I knew girls who had passed as boys, so Brandon was not some weird person to me. Brandon was a very familiar person.\" Peirce was influenced by the public perception of the case, believing the American public were generally misinformed: she said, \"People were also focusing on the crime without giving it much emotional understanding and I think that's really dangerous, especially with this culture of violence that we live in\". Peirce began working on a concept for the film and gave it the working title \"Take It Like a Man\".\nThe project drew interest from various production companies. Diane Keaton's production company, Blue Relief, showed interest in the screenplay in the mid-1990s. Initially, the film was to be largely based on Aphrodite Jones' 1996 true crime book \"All She Wanted\", which told the story of Brandon's final few weeks. Earlier drafts of the script incorporated scenes featuring Brandon's family background, including his sister Tammy and mother Joann, as well as some of Teena's ex-girlfriends. However, Peirce modified the script to fit her vision to focus on the relationship between Brandon and his 19-year-old girlfriend Lana Tisdel, which Peirce termed a \"great love story\", in contrast to \"All She Wanted\", which did not place an emphasis on the relationship.\nTo fund the writing and development of the project, Peirce worked as a paralegal on a midnight shift and as a 35mm film projectionist; she also received a grant from the New York Foundation for the Arts. The project attracted the attention of producer Christine Vachon, who had seen a short film Peirce had made for her thesis in 1995 about the case. IFC Films, Hart Sharp Entertainment, and Killer Films, Vachon and Eva Kolodner's production company, provided financing for the project. IFC contributed roughly $1 million, but the film's eventual budget remained under $2 million. Peirce co-wrote the screenplay with Andy Bienen. They worked together for 18 months on the final drafts and were careful not to \"mythologize\" Brandon; the aim was to keep him as human as possible. In the editing stage of the script, Peirce sent the draft to Fox Searchlight Pictures, which agreed to produce and distribute the film while giving Peirce artistic license.\nPrior to filming, Peirce researched the facts by interviewing the people surrounding the case. She immersed herself in the information available about the murder, including trial transcripts. She met Lana Tisdel at a convenience store and interviewed her at Tisdel's home. Tisdel, who began dating Brandon just two weeks before he was murdered, was 19 years old at the time of the murders and lived in Falls City with her mother. Peirce also interviewed Tisdel's mother and Brandon's acquaintances. However, she was unable to interview Brandon's mother or any of his biological family. Much factual information, including Nissen being a convicted arsonist, was incorporated into \"Boys Don't Cry\".\nCasting.\nThe filmmakers retained the names of most of the case's real-life protagonists, but the names of several supporting characters were altered. For example, the character of Candace was named Lisa Lambert in real life. The casting process for \"Boys Don't Cry\" lasted almost four years. Drew Barrymore was an early candidate to star in the film. Peirce scouted the LGBT community, looking mainly for masculine, lesbian women for the role of Brandon Teena. Peirce said the LGBT community was very interested in the project because of the publicity surrounding the murder. High-profile actors avoided Peirce's auditions at the request of their agents because of the stigma associated with the role.\nAt one point, the project was nearly abandoned because Peirce was not satisfied with most of the people who auditioned. In 1996, after a hundred female actors had been considered and rejected, the relatively unknown actor Hilary Swank sent a videotape to Peirce and was signed on to the project. Swank successfully passed as a boy to the doorman at her audition. During her audition, Swank, who was 22, lied to Peirce about her age. Swank said that like Brandon she was 21 years of age. When Peirce later confronted her about her lie, Swank responded, \"But that's what Brandon would do\". Swank's anonymity as an actor persuaded Peirce to cast her; Peirce said she did not want a \"known actor\" to portray Teena. In addition, Peirce felt that Swank's audition was \"the first time I saw someone who not only blurred the gender lines, but who was this beautiful, androgynous person with this cowboy hat and a sock in her pants, who smiled and loved being Brandon.\"\nPeirce required that Swank \"make a full transformation\" into a male. Immediately after being cast, Peirce took Swank to a hairdresser, where her lower-back length hair was cut and dyed chestnut brown. When she saw her then-husband, Chad Lowe, again, he barely recognized her. Swank prepared for the role by dressing and living as a man for at least a month, including wrapping her chest in tension bandages and putting socks down the front of her trousers as Brandon Teena had done. Her masquerade was convincing; Swank's neighbors believed the \"young man\" coming and going from her home was Swank's visiting brother. She reduced her body fat to seven percent to accentuate her facial structure and refused to let the cast and crew see her out of costume. Swank earned $75 per day for her work on \"Boys Don't Cry\", totaling $3,000. Her earnings were so low that she did not qualify for health insurance.\nFor the role of Brandon's girlfriend, Lana Tisdel, Peirce had envisioned a teenage Jodie Foster. The role was also offered to Reese Witherspoon and Sarah Polley. Peirce ultimately decided to cast Chlo\u00eb Sevigny based on her performance in \"The Last Days of Disco\" (1998). Sevigny had auditioned for the role of Brandon, but Peirce decided Sevigny would be more suited to playing Lana because she could not picture Sevigny as a man.\nSevigny dyed her hair red for the role to match Lana's strawberry blonde hair. Peirce later said, \"Chlo\u00eb just surrendered to the part. She watched videos of Lana. She just became her very naturally.\"\nPeter Sarsgaard played John Lotter, Lana's former boyfriend, who raped and murdered Teena. Sarsgaard was one of the first choices for the role. He later said he wanted his character to be \"likable, sympathetic even\", because he wanted the audience \"to understand why they would hang out with me. If my character wasn't necessarily likable, I wanted him to be charismatic enough that you weren't going to have a dull time if you were with him.\" In another interview, Sarsgaard said he felt \"empowered\" by playing Lotter. In an interview with \"The Independent\", Sarsgaard said, \"I felt very sexy, weirdly, playing John Lotter. I felt like I was just like the sheriff, y'know, and that everyone loved me.\" Sarsgaard recalled watching footage of and reading about Lotter to prepare for the role. Peirce cast Alicia Goranson, known for playing Becky on the sitcom \"Roseanne\", as Candace because of her likeness to Lisa Lambert. Like Sevigny, Goranson had also initially auditioned for the lead role.\nPrincipal photography.\nInitially, \"Boys Don't Cry\" was scheduled to film for thirty days. However, principal photography for the film lasted from October 19 to November 24, 1998. The small budget dictated some of the filming decisions, including the omission of some incidents to speed up the overall pacing. Timing constraints and Peirce's visions relating to the plot limited what could be achieved with the narrative. For example, the film portrays a double murder when in actuality a third person, Phillip DeVine\u2014a black disabled man\u2014was also killed at the scene. At the time, he had been dating Lana Tisdel's sister, Leslie, who was omitted from the story. \"Boys Don't Cry\" was primarily filmed in Greenville, Texas, a small town about northeast of Dallas. Most of the incidents in the case took place in Falls City, Nebraska, but budget constraints led the filmmakers to choose locations in Texas.\nPeirce initially wanted to shoot in Falls City, but Vachon told her that filming there would not be possible. Afterwards, the film was going to be shot in Omaha, Nebraska, but Peirce felt that \"none of [the places] looked right.\" In addition, Peirce also scouted filming locations in Kansas and Florida before deciding on Texas. One of Peirce's main goals was for the audience to sympathize with Brandon. On the film's DVD commentary track, Peirce said, \"The work was informing me about how I wanted to represent it. I wanted the audience to enter deeply into this place, this character, so they could entertain these contradictions in Brandon's own mind and would not think he was crazy, would not think he was lying, but would see him as more deeply human\".\nSome scenes in \"Boys Don't Cry\" required emotional and physical intensity; these were allocated extended periods of filming. The scene in which Brandon, at the wishes of his friends, bumper-skis on the back of a pickup truck, was delayed when a police officer, just arriving at a shift change, required a large lighting crane to be moved from one side of the road to the other. The scenes took six hours to shoot and were filmed at sunrise, resulting in a blue sky being seen in the background. There were some technical complications: some of the filming equipment got stuck in mud, and radio wires in some of the scenes conflicted with the sound production. Swank required a stunt double for a scene in which she falls off the back of a truck. Teena's rape scene was given an extended filming time; Sexton, who portrayed one of the attackers, walked away in tears afterward. Swank found portraying her character daunting and felt the need to \"keep a distance\" from the reality of the actual event. When scenes became difficult, Swank requested the company of her husband on set. At times, Peirce worked for seventeen hours a day in order to complete more work, but the other crew members told her that this was taking up potential nighttime filming hours.\nCinematography.\nPeirce, who had originally sought a career in photography before moving into filmmaking, applied techniques she had learned into the film. She described the film's mood as \"artificial night\". Director of Photography Jim Denault showed her the work of photographer Jan Staller, whose long-exposure night photography under artificial lighting inspired Denault to avoid using \"moonlight\" effects for most of the film. As a way to further incorporate the sense of artificial night, John Pirozzi, who had been experimenting with time-lapse photography using a non-motion-controlled moving camera, was invited to create the transition shots seen throughout the film.\nThe film's visual style depicts the Midwestern United States in a \"withdrawn\", dark and understated light to give a \"surreal\" effect. Denault shot \"Boys Don't Cry\" in flat, spherical format on 35mm film using Kodak Vision film stock. The film was shot with a Moviecam Compact camera fitted with Carl Zeiss super speed lenses. For the scene in which Brandon is stripped, a hand-held camera was used to give a sense of subjectivity and intimacy.\nThe use of low natural light and heavy artificial light is illustrated early in the film in the opening roller rink scene in which Brandon pursues his first relationship with a young woman. For this scene, Peirce used a three-shot method similar to that used in a scene in \"The Wizard of Oz\" (1939) in which Dorothy leaves her house and enters Oz. The scene consists of a three-shot sequence meant to symbolize Brandon's metaphorical \"entrance to manhood\", or Brandon's social transition from a woman to a man. Some scenes were given a prolonged shooting sequence to induce a feeling of hallucination. An example is the sequence in which Brandon and Lana first have sex, followed by a shot of her, Brandon, Candace, and Kate driving in a car against a city skyline backdrop. The scene in which John and Tom strip Brandon was filmed with three cameras due to time constraints, even though Peirce wanted six cameras to film it. The scene took an hour and a half to film in total.\nPeirce drew inspiration from the filming style of John Cassavetes and the early work of Martin Scorsese, and she incorporated neo-realist techniques into the film. She was also influenced by a second style of work\u2014the \"magical\" films of Michael Powell and Kenji Mizoguchi. The former style is used when Brandon joins the social circle of John, Tom, Lana and her mother, while the latter is used when Brandon and Lana begin to depart from that life. The film was also influenced by \"Bonnie and Clyde\" (1967). Peirce incorporated influences from \"Raging Bull\" (1980) by opening the film with a shot of Brandon traveling along a highway, as seen from the character's imaginative or dream perspective, similar to the beginning of \"Raging Bull\". When a character expresses a dream or hopeful assertion, Peirce cuts to an \"eerily lit\" dream landscape. \"The Pawnbroker\" (1964) inspired the cinematography and editing of Brandon's rape scene, particularly in its use of fast cutting.\nMusic.\nBecause the film is set in the rural Midwestern United States, the \"Boys Don't Cry\" soundtrack album features a compilation of country, blues and rock music. Nathan Larson and Nina Persson of The Cardigans composed an instrumental version of Restless Heart's 1988 country-pop song \"The Bluest Eyes in Texas\", a variation of which was used as the film's love theme and score. The song itself is heard during a karaoke scene, sung by Sevigny's character, and at the end of the film. The title of the film is taken from the song of the same name by British rock band The Cure. An American cover of the song, sung by Nathan Larson, plays in the background in the scene in which Lana bails Brandon out of jail and during one of their sex scenes. However, the song is not included on the released soundtrack. Songs by Lynyrd Skynyrd (\"Tuesday's Gone\"), Paisley Underground band Opal (\"She's a Diamond\") and The Charlatans (\"Codine Blues\") also appear in the film, as do cover versions of other songs. The soundtrack was released on November 23, 1999, by Koch Records. \"The Bluest Eyes in Texas\" was played when Hilary Swank went onstage to receive her Academy Award for Best Actress in 2000. The song also plays over the film's end credits.\nThemes and analysis.\n\"Boys Don't Cry\" has been widely discussed and analyzed by scholars and others. Roger Ebert described the film as a \"romantic tragedy\" embedded in a working class American setting, calling it \"\"Romeo and Juliet\" set in a Nebraska trailer park\". Philosopher Rebecca Hanrahan argued that the question of identity\u2014particularly Brandon's\u2014is alluded to frequently in \"Boys Don't Cry\" and that Peirce poses the nature of identification and self as the film's main question. Journalist Janet Maslin said the film is about accepting identity, which in turn means accepting the fate predisposed for that identity. Paula Nechak called the film a \"bold cautionary tale\"; she regarded the film as a negative, dismal depiction of Midwestern America, writing that \"[Peirce's film has] captured the mystique and eerie loneliness\" and \"isolation of the Midwest, with its dusty desolation and nowhere-to-go frustration that propels people to violence and despair\".\nChristine Vachon, the film's executive producer, said, \"It's not just about two stupid thugs who killed somebody. It's about these guys whose world is so tenuous and so fragile that they can't stand to have any of their beliefs shattered\", referring to John and Tom's views of their lives, Brandon's aspirations and his biological sex. Along with other turn-of-the-millennium films such as \"In the Company of Men\" (1997), \"American Beauty\" (1999), \"Fight Club\" (1999), and \"American Psycho\" (2000), Vincent Hausmann said \"Boys Don't Cry\" \"raises the broader, widely explored issue of masculinity in crisis\". Jason Wood said the film, together with Patty Jenkins's \"Monster\" (2003), is an exploration of \"social problems\".\nRomantic and platonic relationships.\nSeveral scholars commented on the relationship between Brandon and Lana as well as Brandon's relationship to John and Tom. Carol Siegel regarded the film as a thematically rich love story between two ill-fated lovers, similar to \"Romeo and Juliet\". Jack Halberstam attributed \"Boys Don't Cry\"'s success to its ostensible argument for tolerance of sexual diversity by depicting a relationship between two unlikely people.\nThis tragic aspect of the love story led Halberstam to compare Brandon and Lana's relationship and subsequent drama to classic and modern romances including \"Romeo and Juliet\", often using the term star-crossed lovers. In the \"Journal for Creativity in Mental Health\", Jinnelle Veronique Aguilar discussed Brandon's ability to create interpersonal relationships in the film. She opined that Brandon wanted to create close relationships, but he could not due to his transgender status until he became close with Lana. \"Although Brandon is able to make a brief but authentic connection with Lana, he continues to experience a sense of aloneness in the world. He consistently faces a sense of fear related to the power-over dynamics that he and others who are transsexual face\u2026Brandon experiences the central relational paradox, in which he yearns for connection; however, due to the real threat he faces, he is unable to make that connection.\"\nMyra Hird, in the \"International Feminist Journal of Politics\", argued that John and Brandon exemplify two different and contrasting types of masculinity, and that Brandon's version is preferred by the film's female characters, comparing them to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jimmy Stewart, respectively. \"Throughout the film, John offers the viewer a typified narrative of heteronormative masculinity. [\u2026] Against this hegemonic masculinity, Brandon offers a masculinity reminiscent of a by-gone era of chivalry.\" Furthermore, she contended that John was threatened by Brandon's version of masculinity. \"Gender boundaries are taken extremely seriously in Western society, and \"Boys Don't Cry\" depicts how intensely threatened John and Tom are by Brandon's superior portrayal of a masculinity 'schedule'. John cannot abide Brandon's desire, and clear ability, to access male privilege, and his reaction is to force Brandon to \"be\" female through the act of rape.\"\nCauses of violence against LGBT people.\nOther commentators discussed the more complex psychological causes of Brandon's murder. Halberstam commented on the complicated causes of the murder, and whether it was due to transphobia or homophobia: \"Ultimately in \"Boys\" [\"Don't Cry\"], the double vision of the transgender subject gives way to the universal vision of humanism, the transgender man and his lover become lesbians and the murder seems instead to be the outcome of vicious homophobic rage.\" Ebert called the film a \"sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame\".\nIn the same journal, Julianne Pidduck commented on the film's rape and murder scenes, \"Effectively, the viewer is asked to experience the rape from the victim's point of view. The film invites political, emotional and corporeal allegiances linked to known and imagined risk, especially for female and/or queer viewers. An allegiance with Brandon's outsider status aligns the viewer with Brandon's initial exhilaration at his transgressive success as a boy, drawing us through to the film's disturbing finale.\"\nSelf and transgender identity.\nMany scholars addressed the various performances of gender by the characters in the film; Moss and Lynne Zeavin offered a psychoanalytic analysis, calling the film a \"case report\" that \"presents [Brandon's] transsexual inclinations as a series of euphoric conquests\" and \"focuses on a range of anxious reactions to her transsexuality. [\u2026] or a case not for what they might reveal about female hysteria, but for what they might reveal about misogyny\". Elaborating on the themes of the film, they wrote:\nIn her film, Pierce [\"sic\"] inserts the unconventional problems of transsexuality into a conventional narrative structure. Throughout the film Brandon is presented as a doomed, though beguiling and beautiful rascal, recognizably located in the lineage of well-known cinematic bad-boys like James Dean, Steve McQueen, and Paul Newman. Like these predecessors, Brandon's heroic stature derives from her [\"sic\"] unwillingness to compromise her [\"sic\"] identity \u2026 Pierce [\"sic\"] presents Brandon's struggles against biological determinism as the struggles of a dignified renegade.\nBrenda Cooper, in \"Critical Studies in Media Communication\", argued that the film \"can be read as a liberatory narrative that queers the centers of heteronormativity and hegemonic masculinity by privileging female masculinity and celebrating its differences from heterosexual norms.\" She argued that the film challenged heteronormativity by criticizing the concept of the American Heartland, by presenting problems with heterosexual masculinity and its internalised aggression, by \"centering female masculinity\", and blurring gender boundaries.\nLater on in the same essay, she commented that Brandon both embodied and rejected traditional masculinity, providing a new outlook on what it means to be a man which excited and thrilled the women in the film: \"Brandon\u2019s performance of masculinity, however, can be interpreted as operating on two levels in the narratives: When Brandon tries to establish his male identity with his new buddies, he imitates the kind of overly aggressive macho machismo that John and Tom represent. But Lana falls for Brandon because of his version of masculinity, which contradicts and challenges traditional assumptions about what it takes to be a man and to please a woman. Brandon\u2019s articulation of manhood effectively mocks sexist masculine ideals and appropriates the codes of normative masculinity.\" Michele Aaron, in \"Screen\", claimed that the film was primarily centered on \"the spectacle of transvestism\" and that the film as a whole was \"a tale of passing\".\nJennifer Esposito wrote that \"We watch onscreen as Brandon binds his breasts, packs a dildo, fixes his hair in a mirror. His masculinity is carefully scripted. John and Tom\u2026are never shown preparing for masculinity. They are already masculine.\" Melissa Rigney argued that the film defied traditional portrayals of transgender characters by not confining Brandon to certain stereotypes. \"On the surface, \"Boys Don't Cry\" appears to hold the potential of rendering gender in excess: the figure of Brandon Teena can be read variously as butch, male, lesbian, transgender, transsexual, and heterosexual. [\u2026] Although female masculinity comes to the forefront in this film, I argue that the film attempts to subsume the transgressive potential of the gender outlaw within a lesbian framework and narrative, one that reduces and, ultimately, nullifies Brandon's gender and sexual excess.\"\nIn contrast, Annabelle Wilcox opined that the film primarily reinforced the gender binary by showing that \"Brandon's body is branded by such rhetoric and representation, and is assumed to be a site of 'truth' that closes the question that being transgender poses for subjectivity, gender, and sexuality.\" She also went on to note that many film critics either disregarded Brandon's male identity or used female pronouns when referring to him. Rachel Swan, writing for \"Film Quarterly\", wrote that Brandon's masculinity was often contrasted with Lana's femininity as a means of illustrating the two sides of the gender binary. In addition, she regarded John and Tom's rape of Brandon as an attempt to psychologically castrate him.\nIn another piece, Halberstam compared the media portrayal of Brandon to that of Billy Tipton, a jazz musician who no one knew was transgender until the post-mortem discovery that he was assigned female at birth. She wrote, \"On some level Brandon's story, while cleaving to its own specificity, needs to remain an open narrative\u2014not a stable narrative of FTM transsexual identity nor a singular tale of queer bashing, not a cautionary fable about the violence of rural America nor an advertisement for urban organizations of queer community; like the narrative of Billy Tipton, Brandon's story permits a dream of transformation.\" Christine Dando argued that \"masculinity is associated with outside and femininity with interior spaces.\"\nSocial class and race.\nLisa Henderson commented on the intersection between social class and gender in the film, particularly Brandon's working-class status: \"My reading of \"Boys\" [\"Don't Cry\"] through the lens of class representation is not born of a univocal search for so-called positive images, but I do recoil at what appears to me to be a new instalment in a long history of popular images of working-class pathology. [\u2026] But that is not the whole story. Within this universe of feeling and reaction structured by lack and tinted blue by country lyrics and a protective and threatening night-time light, characters imbricate gender and class through their longings for love, acceptance and a better life.\"\nJennifer Devere Brody commented on the film's exclusion of Philip DeVine, a disabled African-American man who was another victim of the shooting. \"Perhaps one can only speculate about the motivations behind this decision. But the effects are familiar ones in the history of racist representations. The erasure of DeVine from the narrative places the white female bodies as the only true victims of crime; and the film's inability to show DeVine as violated rather than violator perpetuates the myth of the black man as always already a perpetrator of crime.\" Regarding DeVine, Halberstam wrote, \"Peirce perhaps thought that her film, already running close to two hours, could not handle another subplot, but the story of Philip DeVine is important and it is a crucial part of the drama of gender, race, sexuality, and class that was enacted in the heartland. Race is not incidental to this narrative of mostly white, Midwestern small towns and by omitting DeVine's story from \"Boys Don't Cry\", Peirce contributes to the detachment of transgender narratives from narratives about race, consigning the memory of DeVine to oblivion.\"\nCulture of the Midwestern United States.\nSeveral authors commented on the possible impact that the film's setting of Falls City, Nebraska, located in the Midwestern United States, could have had on the film's plot. Maslin called \"Boys Don't Cry\" a tale of a trapped, small town character's search for life beyond the rural existence and the high price he pays for his view of the American Dream. Regarding the film's portrayal of Nebraska, Halberstam wrote, \"The landscape of Nebraska then serves as a contested site upon which multiple narratives unfold, narratives indeed which refuse to collapse into simply one story. Some of these narratives are narratives of hate, some of desire; others tell of ignorance and brutality; still others of isolation and fear; some allow violence and ignorant prejudices to become the essence of white poor rural identity; still others provoke questions about the deployment of whiteness and the regulation of violence.\"\nChristina Dando wrote that the typical portrayal of the Midwest as a \"frontier\" area did not come through in the film until the setting switched from Lincoln to Falls City: \"The flat landscape, the spacious sky, the home, evoke two different Plains time periods familiar to many Americans through historic photographs: the early settlement process\u2026and 1930s Farm Security Administration photographs. It is virtually timeless. There is also a sense of both place and placelessness. While the landscape is distinctively Plains, it could be described as nowhere.\"\nShe went on to argue that the setting is not only conveyed visually, but also through the characters' homes. \"While there is no trailer park in Falls City, Brandon's community there occupies the margin: Candace and Lana's homes appear to be on the outskirts of town, or even outside of town. There are no complete families, only the family that that has been created. The men appear to have no homes, relationally or physically: none are shown to have family. Speaking about the film's cinematography and the relation to its themes:\nDando compared the film to other tragic books and films that have been set on the Great Plains, including \"My \u00c1ntonia\", \"Giants in the Earth\", \"The Grapes of Wrath\", \"In Cold Blood\", and \"Badlands\", writing that unlike the other works, \"Brandon is [a] character who truly crosses frontiers.\"\nRelease.\nPremiere and commercial performance.\n\"Boys Don't Cry\" aired in Canada at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) in September 1999. It premiered in the U.S. at the New York Film Festival on October 8, 1999, to critical acclaim. It was shown at the Reel Affirmations International Gay and Lesbian Film Festival in early October, where it won further praise and appeared at the Venice International Film Festival. \"Boys Don't Cry\" was given a special screening in snippets at the Sundance Film Festival. At that time, the film was still called \"Take It Like a Man\". The film received a limited release theatrically on October 22, 1999, in the U.S., where it was distributed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, a subsidiary of Twentieth Century Fox that specializes in independent films. Initially, many viewers complained via email to Peirce that the film was not being shown near them, as the film was only being shown on 25 screens across the country. However, this number increased to nearly 200 by March 2000. The film grossed $73,720 in its opening week. By December 5, the film had grossed in excess of $2 million. By May 2000, it had a U.S. total gross of $11,540,607\u2014more than three times its production budget. Internationally, the film was released on March 2, 2000, in Australia and on April 9, 2000, in the United Kingdom.\nCritical reception.\nCritics lauded \"Boys Don't Cry\" upon its release, with many calling it one of the best films of the year. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports 89% of 80 professional critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.90/10; the site's consensus states, \"Harrowing yet stirring, \"Boys Don't Cry\" powerfully commemorates the life -- and brutally unjust death -- of transgender teen Brandon Teena\". Another review aggregator, Metacritic, gave the film an 86 of 100 based on 33 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\". One reviewer said the film was a \"critical knockout\".\nCritics often praised the performances by Swank and Sevigny; Peter Travers said the pair \"give performances that burn in the memory\", and The Film Stage termed Swank's performance \"one of the greatest\" Best Actress Oscar-winning performances. Peter Stack of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" lauded the lead acting performances of Swank, Sevigny, Saarsgard, and Sexton III, writing, \"It may be the best-acted film of the year\". Online film reviewer James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four; he highlighted the performances of Swank and Sevigny as the film's greatest success and likened the film's intensity to that of a train wreck. Berardinelli wrote that Swank \"gives the performance of her career\" and that \"Sevigny's performance is more conventional than Swank's, but no less effective. She provides the counterbalance to the tide of hatred that drowns the last act of the film.\" Emanuel Levy of \"Variety\" called the acting \"flawless\" and concluded that the \"stunningly accomplished\" and \"candid\" film could be \"seen as a \"Rebel Without a Cause\" for these culturally diverse and complex times, with the two misfits enacting a version of the James Dean\u2014Natalie Wood romance with utmost conviction, searching, like their '50s counterparts, for love, self-worth and a place to call home\". Stephen Hunter of \"The Washington Post\" said the performances are of such \"luminous humanity that they break your heart\". \"Premiere\" listed Swank's performance as one of the \"100 Greatest Performances of All Time\". Owen Gleiberman of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called Swank a \"revelation\" and wrote, \"by the end, her Brandon/Teena is beyond male or female. It's as if we were simply glimpsing the character's soul, in all its yearning and conflicted beauty.\"\nOther reviewers were positive towards the way \"Boys Don't Cry\" portrayed its subject matter. and Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" listed \"Boys Don't Cry\" as one of the five best films of 1999, saying, \"this could have been a clinical movie of the week, but instead it's a sad song about a free spirit who tried to fly a little too close to the flame\". Janet Maslin of \"The New York Times\" said the film was \"stunning\" and gave it four stars out of four stars. Maslin said, \"unlike most films about mind-numbing tragedy, this one manages to be full of hope\". Kenneth Turan of the \"Los Angeles Times\" praised the lack of romanticization and dramatization of the characters, and wrote, \"Peirce and Bienen and the expert cast engage us in the actuality of these rootless, hopeless, stoned-out lives without sentimentalizing or romanticizing them\" and that \"\"Boys Don't Cry\" is an exceptional\u2014and exceptionally disturbing film\". Mike Clarke of \"USA Today\" commended Peirce's depth of knowledge of the case and the subject matter, writing, \"Peirce seems to have researched her subject with grad-school-thesis intensity\".\nJay Carr of \"The Boston Globe\" wrote, \"\"Boys Don't Cry\" not only revisits the crime, but convinces us we're being taken inside it\". Stephanie Zacharek of \"Salon\" gave a positive review, singling out the directing and acting. She wrote, \"Peirce ... covers an extraordinary amount of territory, not just in terms of dealing with Brandon\u2019s sexual-identity and self-fulfillment issues, but also in trying to understand the lives of those around him\". Zacharek described Swank's performance as \"a continual revelation\" and Sevigny's performance as \"transformative\". She said, \"When Brandon dies, \"Boys Don\u2019t Cry\" reaches an emotional intensity that\u2019s almost operatic. The saddest thing, though, is seeing Sevigny\u2019s Lana crumpled over his corpse\u2014the way she plays it, you know that when Brandon went, he took a part of her with him, too\". David Edelstein of \"Slate\" was also very positive towards the film, calling it \"a meditation on the irrelevance of gender.\" He went on to praise Swank, Sevigny, and Sarsgaard in their roles, especially Sevigny, writing that she \"keeps the movie tantalizing\".\nThe film was not without detractors, who focused on the film's portrayal of Brandon and his actions. Richard Corliss of \"Time\" magazine was one of the film's negative reviewers; he wrote, \"the film lets down the material. It's too cool: all attitude, no sizzle\". Peter Rainer of \"New York Magazine\" compared the film unfavorably with \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1954), calling it a \"transgendered \" version, elaborating that the film \"could have used a tougher and more exploratory spirit; for Peirce, there was no cruelty, no derangement in Brandon's impostures toward the unsuspecting.\" In 2007, \"Premiere\" ranked the film on its list of \"The 25 Most Dangerous Movies\".\nThe film was generally well-received by the LGBT community. \"Boys Don't Cry\"s release came a year after the murder of a homosexual teenager, Matthew Shepard, which occurred October 12, 1998. The murder sparked additional public interest in hate crime legislation in America and in Brandon Teena, and increased public interest in \"Boys Don't Cry\". Cooper wrote that \"Boys Don't Cry\" \"is perhaps the only film addressing the issue of female masculinity by a self-described queer filmmaker to reach mainstream audiences and to receive critical acclaim and prestigious awards.\" However, Noelle Howey, writing for \"Mother Jones\", wrote that despite the critical acclaim, relatively few critics understood what she perceived as the main point of the film\u2014Brandon being a victim of trans bashing. Howey said, \"Even a cursory glance at reviews of \"Boys Don't Cry\" reveals that while most critics admired the film, few absorbed its main point: that Brandon Teena was a biological girl who felt innately that she was a man. Most of the media instead cast Teena as a Yentl for the new millennium, rather than a victim of anti-transgender bigotry.\"\nFactual accuracy.\nThe accuracy of \"Boys Don't Cry\" was disputed by real-life people involved in the murder. The real Lana Tisdel declared her dislike for the film; she said Brandon never proposed to her and that when she discovered Brandon was transgender, she ended the relationship. Tisdel disliked the way she was portrayed in the film, and called the film the \"second murder of Brandon Teena\". Before the film's theatrical release, Lana Tisdel sued the film's producers, claiming that the film depicted her as \"lazy, white trash and a skanky snake\" and that her family and friends had come to see her as \"a lesbian who did nothing to stop a murder\". Tisdel settled her lawsuit against Fox Searchlight for an undisclosed sum. Sarah Nissen, cousin of perpetrator Marvin Nissen, was also critical of the film, saying, \"There's none of it that's right. It was just weird.\" Leslie Tisdel, Lana's sister, called the film \"a lie of a movie\".\nLana Tisdel's potential involvement in the rape and murder of Brandon Teena was also highlighted. Various people involved in the case, particularly Brandon's family, have alleged that Tisdel was somehow involved with the murders, or had at least set them up in an act of vengeance. Perhaps the most notable admission about Tisdel's motives came from Tom Nissen, who infamously confessed that Tisdel was present at the time of the murders in the car and had even tried knocking on the door of the farmhouse where Brandon, Lambert and DeVine were staying.\nAwards and nominations.\nThe film won a variety of awards, most of which went to Swank for her performance. Swank won a Best Actress Oscar while Sevigny received a nomination in the category of Best Supporting Actress. From the Hollywood Foreign Press, the film received two Golden Globe nominations in the same two categories (Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress) for Swank and Sevigny, winning Best Actress. Swank and Sevigny both received Best Actress Awards from the New York Film Critics Circle, the Chicago Film Critics Association Awards and an Independent Spirit Award. The film won three awards at the Boston Society of Film Critics Awards: Best Actress (Swank), Best Supporting Actress (Sevigny) and Best Director (Peirce). Swank and Sevigny won Satellite Awards for their performances, and the film was nominated in two categories; Best Picture (Drama) and Best Director. It was named one of the best films of the year by the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures.\nThe family of Brandon Teena criticized Swank for her repeated use of the male gender pronoun \"he\" in her Oscar acceptance speech. Teena's mother JoAnn Brandon said her child's transgenderism was a defense mechanism that was developed in response to childhood sexual abuse, rather than being an expression of Teena's gendered sense of self. She said, \"She pretended she was a man so no other man could touch her\". Despite the criticism, Kevin Okeefe, writing for \"Out\", defended Swank's acceptance speech; he said, \"Swank deserves a place in the great acceptance speech canon for being bold, not only as an actress, but as an award winner\".\nRating and home media.\n\"Boys Don't Cry\" garnered significant attention for its graphic rape scene. The film was initially assigned an NC-17 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA); the content was toned down for the U.S. release, where it was rated R. Peirce was interviewed for a 2005 documentary titled \"This Film Is Not Yet Rated\", which discussed the film's problems with the MPAA, particularly the censoring of the sex scenes. The portrayal of a double rape caused significant problems with the MPAA and had to be trimmed to avoid the NC-17 rating. Both the Australian and European version are more explicit, particularly the first rape. Peirce was angry because the MPAA wanted the sex scene between Brandon and Lana removed but was satisfied with the level of brutality in the murder scene. She also claimed that one objection from the MPAA was that one scene featured an orgasm that was \"too long\", and rhetorically asked if anyone had ever been hurt by an orgasm that was too long.\n\"Boys Don't Cry\" was first released on home video by Fox Searchlight Pictures in September 2000 apart of a \"Premiere Series\", preceded by a DVD release in April 2000 in the United States and Canada. The DVD's special features included a commentary by Kimberly Peirce and a behind-the-scenes featurette containing interviews with Peirce, Swank and Sevigny; there was also a theatrical trailer and three television trailers. This same edition was re-released in 2009 with different cover art. The film was released on Blu-ray on February 16, 2011, by 20th Century Fox Entertainment in conjunction with Fox Path\u00e9 Europa."}
{"title": "Sense_and_Sensibility_(film)", "label": "Film", "text": "Sense and Sensibility is a 1995 period drama film directed by Ang Lee and based on Jane Austen's 1811 novel of the same name. Emma Thompson wrote the screenplay and stars as Elinor Dashwood, while Dame Kate Winslet plays Elinor's younger sister Marianne. The story follows the Dashwood sisters, members of a wealthy English family of landed gentry, as they must deal with circumstances of sudden destitution. They are forced to seek financial security through marriage. Hugh Grant and Alan Rickman play their respective suitors.\nProducer Lindsay Doran, a longtime admirer of Austen's novel, hired Thompson to write the screenplay. She spent five years drafting numerous revisions, continually working on the script between other films as well as into production of the film itself. Studios were nervous that Thompson \u2014 a first-time screenwriter \u2014 was the credited writer, but Columbia Pictures agreed to distribute the film. Though initially intending to have another actress portray Elinor, Thompson was persuaded to take the role.\nThompson's screenplay exaggerated the Dashwood family's wealth to make their later scenes of poverty more apparent to modern audiences. It also altered the traits of the male leads to make them more appealing to contemporary viewers. Elinor and Marianne's different characteristics were emphasised through imagery and invented scenes. Lee was selected as director, both for his work in the 1993 film \"The Wedding Banquet\" and because Doran believed he would help the film appeal to a wider audience. Lee was given a budget of $16 million.\n\"Sense and Sensibility\" was released on 13 December 1995, in the United States. A commercial success, earning $135 million worldwide, the film garnered overwhelmingly positive reviews upon release and received many accolades, including three awards and eleven nominations at the 1995 British Academy Film Awards. It earned seven Academy Awards nominations, including for Best Picture and Best Actress. Thompson received the award for Best Adapted Screenplay, becoming the only person to have won Academy Awards for both acting and screenwriting. \"Sense and Sensibility\" contributed to a resurgence in popularity for Austen's works, and has led to many more productions in similar genres. It persists in being recognised as one of the best Austen adaptations of all time, and also one of the best films of the 1990s.\nPlot.\nOn his deathbed, Mr. Dashwood tells his son from his first marriage, John, to take care of his second wife and three daughters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, since under English law they will inherit nothing. John promises to do so. John's stingy, greedy, and snobbish wife Fanny convinces him to give his half-sisters nothing financially; John and Fanny immediately install themselves in the large house, forcing the Dashwood ladies to look for a new home. Fanny invites her brother Edward Ferrars to stay with them. Elinor and Edward soon form a close friendship. Fanny tells Mrs. Dashwood that Edward would be disinherited if he married someone of no importance or with no money.\nSir John Middleton, Mrs. Dashwood's cousin, offers her a small cottage house on his estate, Barton Park in Devonshire. She and her daughters move in and are frequent guests at Barton Park. The Dashwoods meet the older Colonel Brandon, who falls in love with Marianne at first sight. However, Marianne considers him incapable of feeling love or inspiring it in another. One afternoon, Marianne takes a walk with Margaret and slips and falls in the rain. She is carried home by the dashing John Willoughby, with whom Marianne falls in love. They spend a great deal of time together, but on the morning she expects him to propose marriage to her, he instead leaves hurriedly for London.\nSir John's mother-in-law, Mrs. Jennings, invites her daughter and son-in-law, Mr. and Mrs. Palmer, to visit. They bring with them Lucy Steele. Lucy confides in Elinor that she and Edward have been engaged secretly for five years. The friendship between Edward and Elinor has become mutual love, but they cannot marry because Edward has been secretly engaged to Lucy and will not break his promise to her. Elinor sacrifices her own happiness to preserve Edward's integrity.\nMrs. Jennings takes Lucy, Elinor, and Marianne to London, where they meet Willoughby at a ball. He greets Marianne uncomfortably and barely acknowledges their acquaintance, and they soon learn he is engaged to the extremely wealthy Miss Grey. Marianne becomes inconsolable. Colonel Brandon later explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced and abandoned his ward Beth, the illegitimate daughter of Brandon's former love, Eliza. When Willoughby's aunt and benefactress, Lady Allen, learned of his behavior, she disinherited him, so he chose to marry for money. The honest Brandon tells Elinor that Willoughby, though he had been a libertine with Beth, did love Marianne but had no other way of avoiding financial ruin than to marry Miss Grey.\nLucy Steele is invited to stay with John and Fanny Dashwood. Lucy, believing she has a friend in Fanny, confides her clandestine engagement to Edward and is thrown out of the house. Edward's mother demands that he break off the engagement. When he refuses, she arranges to have his fortune transferred to his younger brother, Robert. On hearing this, Colonel Brandon offers Edward the parish on his estate, feeling sympathy for the unfortunate but honorable Edward.\nOn their way home to Devonshire, Elinor and Marianne stop for the night at the country estate of the Palmers, who live near Willoughby's estate. Marianne becomes gravely ill with a fever after walking in torrential rain to look down on the Willoughby's estate in tears. Colonel Brandon finds her and carries her home. The Palmers leave, on medical advice, fearing their newborn child will catch the disease. Elinor stays at Marianne's side until she recovers, and the sisters return home. Colonel Brandon and Marianne begin spending time together as Marianne has a new appreciation for him. She admits to Elinor that even if Willoughby had chosen her, she is no longer convinced that love would have been enough to make him happy.\nThe Dashwoods soon learn that Miss Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars and assume she married Edward. Later, Edward visits their house and tells them that Miss Steele married his brother Robert. Hearing this, Elinor finally breaks down, unable to repress her feelings any longer. Edward tells Elinor, \"My heart is, and always will be, yours,\" and they marry. Soon afterward, Marianne marries Colonel Brandon, finally returning his love. Willoughby watches their wedding from a distance with a look of regret on his face and rides away.\nProduction.\nConception and adaptation.\nIn 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new president of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel \"Sense and Sensibility\" to her colleagues. It had been adapted twice, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that \"all of [Austen's] books are funny and emotional, but \"Sense and Sensibility\" is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just when you think you know what's going on, everything is different. It's got real suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible.\" She also praised the novel for possessing \"wonderful characters\u00a0... \"three\" strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending.\"\nPrior to being hired at Mirage, the producer had spent years looking for a suitable screenwriter \u2013 someone who was \"equally strong in the areas of satire and romance\" and could think in Austen's language \"almost as naturally as he or she could think in the language of the twentieth century.\" Doran read screenplays by English and American writers until she came across a series of comedic skits, often in period settings, that actress Emma Thompson had written. Doran believed the humour and style of writing was \"exactly what [she'd] been searching for.\" Thompson and Doran were already working together on Mirage's 1991 film \"Dead Again.\" A week after its completion, the producer selected Thompson to adapt \"Sense and Sensibility\", although she knew that Thompson had never written a screenplay. Also a fan of Austen, Thompson first suggested they adapt \"Persuasion\" or \"Emma\" before agreeing to Doran's proposal. The actress found that \"Sense and Sensibility\" contained more action than she had remembered, and decided it would translate well to drama.\nThompson spent five years writing and revising the screenplay, both during and between shooting other films. Believing the novel's language to be \"far more arcane than in [Austen's] later books,\" Thompson sought to simplify the dialogue while retaining the \"elegance and wit of the original.\" She observed that in a screenwriting process, a first draft often had \"a lot of good stuff in it\" but needed to be edited, and second drafts would \"almost certainly be rubbish\u00a0... because you get into a panic.\" Thompson credited Doran that she could \"help me, nourish me and mentor me through that process\u00a0... I learned about screenwriting at her feet.\"\nThompson's first draft was more than three hundred handwritten pages, which required her to reduce it to a more manageable length. She found the romances to be the most difficult to \"juggle\", and her draft received some criticism for the way it presented Willoughby and Edward. Doran later recalled the work was criticized for not getting underway until Willoughby's arrival, with Edward sidelined as backstory. Thompson and Doran quickly realised that \"if we didn't meet Edward and do the work and take that twenty minutes to set up those people\u00a0... then it wasn't going to work.\" At the same time, Thompson wished to avoid depicting \"a couple of women waiting around for men\"; gradually her screenplay focused as much on the Dashwood sisters' relationship with each other as it did with their romantic interests.\nWith the draft screenplay, Doran pitched the idea to various studios in order to finance the film, but found that many were wary of the beginner Thompson as the screenwriter. She was considered a risk, as her experience was as an actress who had never written a film script. Columbia Pictures executive Amy Pascal supported Thompson's work, and agreed to sign as the producer and distributor.\nAs Thompson mentioned on the BBC program \"QI\" in 2009, at one point in the writing process a computer failure almost lost the entire work. In panic Thompson called fellow actor and close friend Stephen Fry, the host of \"QI\" and a self-professed \"geek\". After seven hours, Fry was able to recover the documents from the device while Thompson had tea with Hugh Laurie who was at Fry's house at the time.\nLee's hire.\nTaiwanese director Ang Lee was hired as a result of his work in the 1993 family comedy film \"The Wedding Banquet\", which he co-wrote, produced, and directed. He was not familiar with Jane Austen. Doran felt that Lee's films, which depicted complex family relationships amidst a social comedy context, were a good fit with Austen's storylines. She recalled, \"The idea of a foreign director was intellectually appealing even though it was very scary to have someone who didn't have English as his first language.\" The producer sent Lee a copy of Thompson's script, to which he replied that he was \"cautiously interested\". Fifteen directors were interviewed, but according to Doran, Lee was one of the few who recognised Austen's humour; he told them he wanted the film to \"break people's hearts so badly that they'll still be recovering from it two months later.\"\nFrom the beginning, Doran wanted \"Sense and Sensibility\" to appeal to both a core audience of Austen aficionados as well as younger viewers attracted to romantic comedy films. She felt that Lee's involvement prevented the film from becoming \"just some little English movie\" that appealed only to local audiences instead of to the wider world. Lee said,\n\"I thought they were crazy: I was brought up in Taiwan, what do I know about 19th-century England? About halfway through the script it started to make sense why they chose me. In my films I've been trying to mix social satire and family drama. I realised that all along I had been trying to do Jane Austen without knowing it. Jane Austen was my destiny. I just had to overcome the cultural barrier.\"Because Thompson and Doran had worked on the screenplay for so long, Lee described himself at the time as a \"director for hire\", as he was unsure of his role and position. He spent six months in England \"learn[ing] how to make this movie, how to do a period film, culturally\u00a0... and how to adapt to the major league film industry.\"\nIn January 1995, Thompson presented a draft to Lee, Doran, co-producer Laurie Borg, and others working on the production, and spent the next two months editing the screenplay based upon their feedback. Thompson would continue making revisions throughout production of the film, including altering scenes to meet budgetary concerns, adding dialogue changes, and changing certain aspects to better fit the actors. Brandon's confession scene, for instance, initially included flashbacks and stylised imagery before Thompson decided it was \"emotionally more interesting to let Brandon tell the story himself and find it difficult.\"\nCasting.\nThompson initially hoped that Doran would cast sisters Natasha and Joely Richardson as Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Lee and Columbia wanted Thompson herself, now a \"big-deal movie star\" after her critically successful role in the 1992 film \"Howards End\", to play Elinor. The actress replied that at the age of thirty-five, she was too old for the nineteen-year-old character. Lee suggested Elinor's age be changed to twenty-seven, which would also have made the difficult reality of spinsterhood easier for modern audiences to understand. Thompson agreed, later stating that she was \"desperate to get into a corset and act it and stop thinking about it as a script.\"\nThe formal casting process began in February 1995, though some of the actors met with Thompson the previous year to help her conceptualise the script. Lee eventually cast all but one of them: Hugh Grant (as Edward Ferrars), Robert Hardy (as Sir John Middleton), Harriet Walter (as Fanny Ferrars Dashwood), Imelda Staunton (as Charlotte Jennings Palmer), and Hugh Laurie (as Mr. Palmer). Amanda Root had also worked with Thompson on the screenplay, but had already committed to star in the 1995 film \"Persuasion\". Commenting on the casting of Laurie, whom she had known for years, Thompson has said, \"There is no one [else] on the planet who could capture Mr. Palmer's disenchantment and redemption so perfectly, and make it funny.\"\nThompson wrote the part of Edward Ferrars with Grant in mind, and he agreed to receive a lower salary in line with the film's budget. Grant called her screenplay \"genius\", explaining \"I've always been a philistine about Jane Austen herself, and I think Emma's script is miles better than the book and much more amusing.\" Grant's casting was criticised by the Jane Austen Society of North America (JASNA), whose representatives said that he was too handsome for the part. Actress Kate Winslet initially intended to audition for the role of Marianne but Lee disliked her work in the 1994 drama film \"Heavenly Creatures;\" she auditioned for the lesser part of Lucy Steele. Winslet pretended she had heard that the audition was still for Marianne, and won the part based on a single reading. Thompson later said that Winslet, only nineteen years old, approached the part \"energised and open, realistic, intelligent, and tremendous fun.\" The role helped Winslet become recognised as a significant actress.\nAlso appearing in the film was Alan Rickman, who portrayed Colonel Brandon. Thompson was pleased that Rickman could express the \"extraordinary sweetness [of] his nature,\" as he had played \"Machiavellian types so effectively\" in other films. Greg Wise was cast as Marianne's other romantic interest, John Willoughby, his most noted role thus far. Twelve-year-old Emilie Fran\u00e7ois, appearing as Margaret Dashwood, was one of the last people cast in the production; she had no professional acting experience. Thompson praised the young actress in her production diaries, \"Emilie has a natural quick intelligence that informs every movement \u2013 she creates spontaneity in all of us just by being there.\" Other cast members included Gemma Jones as Mrs. Dashwood, James Fleet as John Dashwood, Elizabeth Spriggs as Mrs. Jennings, Imogen Stubbs as Lucy Steele, Richard Lumsden as Robert Ferrars, Tom Wilkinson as Mr. Dashwood, and Lone Vidahl as Miss Grey.\nCostume design.\nAccording to Austen scholar Linda Troost, the costumes used in \"Sense and Sensibility\" helped emphasise the class and status of the various characters, particularly among the Dashwoods. They were created by Jenny Beavan and John Bright, a team of designers best known for Merchant Ivory films who began working together in 1984. The two attempted to create accurate period dress, and featured the \"fuller, classical look and colours of the late 18th century.\" They found inspiration in the works of the English artists Thomas Rowlandson, John Hopper, and George Romney, and also reviewed fashion plates stored in the Victoria and Albert Museum. The main costumes and hats were manufactured at Cosprop, a London-based costumer company.\nTo achieve the tightly wound curls fashionably inspired by Greek art, some of the actresses wore wigs while others employed heated hair twists and slept in pin curls. Fanny, the snobbiest of the characters, possesses the tightest of curls but has less of a Greek silhouette, a reflection of her wealth and silliness. Beavan stated that Fanny and Mrs. Jennings \"couldn't quite give up the frills,\" and instead draped themselves in lace, fur, feathers, jewellery, and rich fabrics. Conversely, sensible Elinor opts for simpler accessories, such as a long gold chain and a straw hat. Fanny's shallow personality is also reflected in \"flashy, colourful\" dresses, while Edward's buttoned-up appearance represents his \"repressed\" personality, with little visible skin. Each of the 100 extras used in the London ballroom scene, depicting \"soldiers and lawyers to fops and dowagers,\" don visually distinct costumes.\nFor Brandon's costumes, Beavan and Bright consulted with Thompson and Lee and decided to have him project an image of \"experienced and dependable masculinity.\" Brandon is first seen in black, but later he wears sporting gear in the form of corduroy jackets and shirtsleeves. His rescue of Marianne has him transforming into the \"romantic Byronic hero\", sporting an unbuttoned shirt and loose cravat. In conjunction with his tragic backstory, Brandon's \"flattering\" costumes help his appeal to the audience. Beavan and Bright's work on the film earned them a nomination for Best Costume Design at the 68th Academy Awards.\nFilming.\nThe film was budgeted at $16 million, the largest Ang Lee had yet received as well as the largest awarded to an Austen film that decade. In the wake of the success of Columbia's 1994 film \"Little Women\", the American studio authorised Lee's \"relatively high budget\" out of an expectation that it would be another cross-over hit and appeal to multiple audiences, thus yielding high box office returns. Nevertheless, Doran considered it a \"low budget film\", and many of the ideas Thompson and Lee came up with \u2013 such as an early dramatic scene depicting Mr. Dashwood's bloody fall from a horse \u2013 were deemed unfilmable from a cost perspective.\nAccording to Thompson, Lee \"arrived on set with the whole movie in his head\". Rather than focus on period details, he wanted the film to concentrate on telling a good story. He showed the cast a selection of films adapted from classic novels, including \"Barry Lyndon\" and \"The Age of Innocence\", which he believed to be \"great movies; everybody worships the art work, [but] it's not what we want to do\". Lee criticised the latter film for lacking energy, in contrast to the \"passionate tale\" of \"Sense and Sensibility\".\nThe cast and crew experienced \"slight culture shock\" with Lee on a number of occasions. He expected the assistant directors to be the \"tough ones\" and keep production on schedule, while they expected the same of him; this led to a slower schedule in the early stages of production. Additionally, according to Thompson, the director became \"deeply hurt and confused\" when she and Grant made suggestions for certain scenes, which was something that was not done in his native country. Lee thought his authority was being undermined and lost sleep, though this was gradually resolved as he became used to their methods. The cast \"grew to trust his instincts so completely\", making fewer and fewer suggestions. Co-producer James Schamus stated that Lee also adapted by becoming more verbal and willing to express his opinion.\nLee became known for his \"frightening\" tendency not to \"mince words\". He often had the cast do numerous takes for a scene to get the perfect shot, and was not afraid to call something \"boring\" if he disliked it. Thompson later recalled that Lee would \"always come up to you and say something unexpectedly crushing\", such as asking her not to \"look so old\". She also commented, however, that \"he doesn't indulge us but is always kind when we fail\". Due to Thompson's extensive acting experience, Lee encouraged her to practice t'ai chi to \"help her relax [and] make her do things simpler\". Other actors soon joined them in meditating \u2013 according to Doran, it \"was pretty interesting. There were all these pillows on the floor and these pale-looking actors were saying, 'What have we got ourselves into?' [Lee] was more focused on body language than any director I've ever seen or heard of.\" He suggested Winslet read books of poetry and report back to him to best understand her character. He also had Thompson and Winslet live together to develop their characters' sisterly bond. Many of the cast took lessons in etiquette and riding side-saddle.\nLee found that in contrast to Chinese cinema, he had to dissuade many of the actors from using a \"very stagy, very English tradition. Instead of just being observed like a human being and getting sympathy, they feel they have to do things, they have to carry the movie.\" Grant in particular often had to be restrained from giving an \"over-the-top\" performance; Lee later recalled that the actor is \"a show stealer. You can't stop that. I let him do, I have to say, less 'star' stuff, the Hugh Grant thing\u00a0... and not [let] the movie serve him, which is probably what he's used to now.\" For the scene in which Elinor learns Edward is unmarried, Thompson found inspiration from her reaction to her father's death. Grant was unaware that Thompson would cry through most of his speech, and the actress attempted to reassure him, \"'There's no other way, and I promise you it'll work, and it will be funny as well as being touching.' And he said, 'Oh, all right,' and he was very good about it.\" Lee had one demand for the scene, that Thompson avoid the temptation to turn her head towards the camera.\nLocations.\nProduction of \"Sense and Sensibility\" was scheduled for fifty-eight days, though this was eventually extended to sixty-five. Filming commenced in mid-April 1995 at a number of locations in Devon, beginning with Saltram House (standing in for Norland Park), where Winslet and Jones shot the first scene of the production: when their characters read about Barton Cottage. As Saltram was a National Trust property, Schamus had to sign a contract before production began, and staff with the organisation remained on set to carefully monitor the filming. Production later returned to shoot several more scenes, finishing there on 29 April. The second location of filming, Flete House, stood in for part of Mrs. Jennings' London estate, where Edward first sees Elinor with Lucy. Representing Barton Cottage was a Flete Estate stone cottage called Efford House in Holbeton, which Thompson called \"one of the most beautiful spots we've ever seen.\"\nEarly May saw production at the \"exquisite\" St Mary's Church in Berry Pomeroy for the final wedding scene. From the tenth to the twelfth of May, Marianne's first rescue sequence, depicting her encounter with Willoughby, was shot. Logistics were difficult, as the scene was set upon a hill during a rainy day. Lee shot around fifty takes, with the actors becoming soaked under rain machines; this led to Winslet eventually collapsing from hypothermia. Further problems occurred midway through filming, when Winslet contracted phlebitis in her leg, developed a limp, and sprained her wrist after falling down a staircase.\nFrom May to July, production took place at a number of other National Trust estates and stately homes across England. Trafalgar House and Wilton House in Wiltshire stood in for the grounds of Barton Park and the London Ballroom respectively. Mompesson House, an eighteenth-century townhouse located in Salisbury, represented Mrs. Jennings' sumptuous townhouse. Sixteenth-century Montacute House in Somerset was the setting for the Palmer estate of Cleveland House. Further scenes were shot at Compton Castle in Devon (Mr Willoughby's estate) and at the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich.\nMusic.\nComposer Patrick Doyle, who had previously worked with his friend Emma Thompson in the films \"Henry V\", \"Much Ado About Nothing\", and \"Dead Again\", was hired to produce the music for \"Sense and Sensibility\". Asked by the director to select existing music or compose new \"gentle\" melodies, Doyle wrote a score that reflected the film's events. He explained, \"You had this middle-class English motif, and with the music you would have occasional outbursts of emotion.\" Doyle explains that the score \"becomes a little more grown-up\" as the story progresses to one of \"maturity and an emotional catharsis.\" The score contains romantic elements and has been described by National Public Radio as a \"restricted compass\u00a0... of emotion\" with \"instruments [that] blend together in a gentle sort of way\". They also noted that as a reflection of the story, the score is a \"little wistful\u00a0... and sentimental.\"\nTwo songs are sung by Marianne in the film, with lyrics adapted from seventeenth-century poems. Lee believed that the two songs conveyed the \"vision of duality\" visible both in the novel and script. In his opinion, the second song expressed Marianne's \"mature acceptance,\" intertwined with a \"sense of melancholy\". The melody of \"Weep You No More Sad Fountains\", Marianne's first song, appears in the opening credits, while her second song's melody features again during the ending credits, this time sung by dramatic soprano Jane Eaglen. The songs were written by Doyle before filming began. The composer received his first Academy Award nomination for his score.\nEditing.\nThompson and Doran discussed how much of the love stories to depict, as the male characters spend much of the novel away from the Dashwood sisters. The screenwriter had to carefully balance the amount of screentime she gave to the male leads, noting in her film production diary that such a decision would \"very much lie in the editing.\" Thompson wrote \"hundreds of different versions\" of romantic storylines. She considered having Edward re-appear midway through the film before deciding that it would not work as \"there was nothing for him to do.\" Thompson also opted to exclude the duel scene between Brandon and Willoughby, which is described in the novel, because it \"only seemed to subtract from the mystery.\" She and Doran agonised about when and how to reveal Brandon's backstory, as they wanted to prevent viewers from becoming bored. Thompson described the process of reminding audiences of Edward and Brandon as \"keeping plates spinning\".\nA scene was shot of Brandon finding his ward in a poverty-stricken area in London, but this was excluded from the film. Thompson's script included a scene of Elinor and Edward kissing, as the studio \"couldn't stand the idea of these two people who we've been watching all the way through not kissing.\" It was one of the first scenes cut during editing: the original version was over three hours, Lee was less interested in the story's romance, and Thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate. The scene was included in marketing materials and the film trailer. Thompson and Doran also cut out a scene depicting Willoughby as remorseful when Marianne is sick. Doran said that despite it \"being one of the great scenes in book history,\" they could not get it to fit into the film.\nTim Squyres edited the film, his fourth collaboration with Ang Lee. He reflected in 2013 about the editing process:\nIt was the first film that I had done with Ang that was all in English, and it's Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Alan Rickman, and Hugh Grant \u2014 these great, great actors. When you get footage like that, you realise that your job is really not technical. It was my job to look at something that Emma Thompson had done and say, \"Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead.\" And not only was I allowed to pass judgment on these tremendous actors, I was required to.\nThemes and analysis.\nChanges from source material.\nScholar Louise Flavin has noted that Thompson's screenplay contains significant alterations to the characters of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood: in the novel, the former embodies \"sense\", i.e. \"sensible\" in our terms, and the latter, \"sensibility\", i.e. \"sensitivity\" in our terms. Audience members are meant to view self-restrained Elinor as the person in need of reform, rather than her impassioned sister. To heighten the contrast between them, Marianne and Willoughby's relationship includes an \"erotic\" invented scene in which the latter requests a lock of her hair \u2013 a direct contrast to Elinor's \"reserved relationship\" with Edward. Lee also distinguishes them through imagery \u2013 Marianne is often seen with musical instruments, near open windows, and outside, while Elinor is pictured in door frames. Another character altered for modern viewers is Margaret Dashwood, who conveys \"the frustrations that a girl of our times might feel at the limitations facing her as a woman in the early nineteenth century.\" Thompson uses Margaret for exposition in order to detail contemporary attitudes and customs. For instance, Elinor explains to a curious Margaret \u2013 and by extension, the audience \u2013 why their half-brother inherits the Dashwood estate. Margaret's altered storyline, giving her an interest in fencing and geography, also allows audience members to see the \"feminine\" side of Edward and Brandon, as they become father or brother figures to her. The film omits the characters of Lady Middleton and her children, as well as that of Ann Steele, Lucy's sister.\nWhen adapting the characters for film, Thompson found that in the novel, \"Edward and Brandon are quite shadowy and absent for long periods,\" and that \"making the male characters effective was one of the biggest problems. Willoughby is really the only male who springs out in three dimensions.\" Several major male characters in \"Sense and Sensibility\" were consequently altered significantly from the novel in an effort to appeal to contemporary audiences. Grant's Edward and Rickman's Brandon are \"ideal\" modern males who display an obvious love of children as well as \"pleasing manners\", especially when contrasted with Palmer. Thompson's script both expanded and omitted scenes from Edward's storyline, including the deletion of an early scene in which Elinor assumes that a lock of hair found in Edward's possession is hers, when it belongs to Lucy. He was made more fully realised and honourable than in the novel to increase his appeal to viewers. To gradually show viewers why Brandon is worthy of Marianne's love, Thompson's screenplay has his storyline mirroring Willoughby's; they are similar in appearance, share a love of music and poetry, and rescue Marianne in the rain while on horseback.\nClass.\nThompson viewed the novel as a story of \"love and money,\" noting that some people needed one more than the other. During the writing process, executive producer Sydney Pollack stressed that the film be understandable to modern audiences, and that it be made clear why the Dashwood sisters could not just obtain a job. \"I'm from Indiana; if I get it, everyone gets it,\" he said. Thompson believed that Austen was just as comprehensible in a different century, \"You don't think people are still concerned with marriage, money, romance, finding a partner?\" She was keen to emphasise the realism of the Dashwoods' predicament in her screenplay, and inserted scenes to make the differences in wealth more apparent to modern audiences. Thompson made the Dashwood family richer than in the book and added elements to help contrast their early wealth with their later financial predicament; for instance, because it might have been confusing to viewers that one could be poor and still have servants, Elinor is made to address a large group of servants at Norland Park early in the film for viewers to remember when they see their few staff at Barton Cottage. Lee also sought to emphasise social class and the limitations it placed on the protagonists. Lee conveys this in part when Willoughby publicly rejects Marianne; he returns to a more lavishly furnished room, a symbol of the wealth she has lost. \"Family dramas,\" he stated, \"are all about conflict, about family obligations versus free will.\"\nThe film's theme of class has attracted much scholarly attention. Carole Dole noted that class constitutes an important element in Austen's stories and is \"impossible\" to avoid when adapting her novels. According to Dole, Lee's film contains an \"ambiguous treatment of class values\" that stresses social differences but \"underplays the consequences of the class distinctions so important in the novel\"; for instance, Edward's story ends upon his proposal to Elinor, with no attention paid to how they will live on his small annual income from the vicarage. Louise Flavin believed that Lee used the houses to represent their occupants' class and character: the Dashwood sisters' decline in eligibility is represented through the contrast between the spacious rooms of Norland Park and those of the isolated, cramped Barton Cottage. James Thompson criticised what he described as the anaesthetised \"m\u00e9lange of disconnected picture postcard-gift-calendar-perfect scenes,\" in which little connection is made between \"individual subjects and the land that supports them.\" Andrew Higson argued that while \"Sense and Sensibility\" includes commentary on sex and gender, it fails to pursue issues of class. Thompson's script, he wrote, displays a \"sense of impoverishment [but is] confined to the still privileged lifestyle of the disinherited Dashwoods. The broader class system is pretty much taken for granted.\" The ending visual image of flying gold coins, depicted during Marianne's wedding, has also drawn attention; Marsha McCreadie noted that it serves as a \"visual wrap-up and emblem of the merger between money and marriage.\"\nGender.\nGender has been seen as another major theme of the film, often intersecting with class. Penny Gay observed that Elinor's early dialogue with Edward about \"feel[ing] idle and useless ... [with] no hope whatsoever of any occupation\" reflected Thompson's background as a \"middle class, Cambridge-educated feminist.\" Conversely, Dole wrote that Thompson's version of Elinor \"has a surprising anti-feminist element to it,\" as she appears more dependent on men than the original character; the film presents her as repressed, resulting in her emotional breakdown with Edward. Linda Troost opined that Lee's production prominently features \"radical feminist and economic issues\" while \"paradoxically endorsing the conservative concept of marriage as a woman's goal in life.\" Despite this \"mixed political agenda,\" Troost believed that the film's faithfulness to the traditional heritage film genre is evident through its use of locations, costumes, and attention to details, all of which also emphasize class and status. Gay and Julianne Pidduck stated that gender differences are expressed by showing the female characters indoors, while their male counterparts are depicted outside confidently moving throughout the countryside. Nora Stovel observed that Thompson \"emphasises Austen's feminist satire on Regency gender economics,\" drawing attention not only to the financial plight of the Dashwoods but also to eighteenth-century women in general.\nMarketing and release.\nIn the United States, Sony and Columbia Pictures released \"Sense and Sensibility\" on a slow schedule compared to mainstream films, first premiering it on 13 December 1995. Believing that a limited release would position the film both as an \"exclusive quality picture\" and increase its chances of winning Academy Awards, Columbia dictated that its first weekend involve only seventy cinemas in the US; it opened in eleventh place in terms of box office takings and earned $721,341. To benefit from the publicity surrounding potential Academy Award candidates and increase its chance of earning nominations, the film was released within \"Oscar season\". The number of theatres showing \"Sense and Sensibility\" was slowly expanded, with particular surges when its seven Oscar nominations were announced and at the time of the ceremony in late March, until it was present in over one thousand cinemas across the US. By the end of its American release, \"Sense and Sensibility\" had been watched by more than eight million people, garnering an \"impressive\" total domestic gross of $43,182,776.\nOn the basis of Austen's reputation as a serious author, the producers were able to rely on high-brow publications to help market their film. Near the time of its US release, large spreads in \"The New York Review of Books\", \"Vanity Fair\", \"Film Comment\", and other media outlets featured columns on Lee's production. In late December, \"Time\" magazine declared it and \"Persuasion\" to be the best films of 1995. Andrew Higson referred to all this media exposure as a \"marketing coup\" because it meant the film \"was reaching one of its target audiences.\" Meanwhile, most promotional images featured the film as a \"sort of chick flick in period garb.\" New Market Press published Thompson's screenplay and film diary; in its first printing, the hard cover edition sold 28,500 copies in the US. British publisher Bloomsbury released a paperback edition of the novel containing film pictures, same title design, and the cast's names on the cover, whilst Signet Publishing in the US printed 250,000 copies instead of the typical 10,000 a year; actress Julie Christie read the novel in an audiobook released by Penguin Audiobooks. \"Sense and Sensibility\" increased dramatically in terms of its book sales, ultimately hitting tenth place on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list for paperbacks in February 1996.\nIn the United Kingdom, \"Sense and Sensibility\" was released on 23 February 1996 in order to \"take advantage of the hype from \"Pride and Prejudice\"\", another popular Austen adaptation recently broadcast. Columbia Tristar's head of UK marketing noted that \"if there was any territory this film was going to work, it was in the UK.\" After receiving positive responses at previews, marketing strategies focused on selling it as both a costume drama and as a film attractive to mainstream audiences. Attention was also paid to marketing \"Sense and Sensibility\" internationally. Because the entire production cycle had consistently emphasised it as being \"bigger\" than a normal British period drama literary film, distributors avoided labelling it as \"just another English period film.\" Instead, marketing materials featured quotations from populist newspapers such as the \"Daily Mail\", which compared the film to \"Four Weddings and a Funeral\" (1994). It was watched by more than ten million viewers in Europe. Worldwide, the film ultimately grossed $134,582,776, a sum that reflected its commercial success. It had the largest box office gross out of the Austen adaptations of the 1990s.\nReception.\nCritical response.\n\"Sense and Sensibility\" received overwhelmingly positive reviews from film critics, and was included on more than a hundred top-ten of the year lists. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has a 97% approval rating based on 64 reviews, with an average rating of 8.00/10. The website's consensus reads, \"\"Sense and Sensibility\" is an uncommonly deft, very funny Jane Austen adaptation, marked by Emma Thompson's finely tuned performance.\" On Metacritic, the film has an average score of 84 out of 100 based on 21 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim.\" Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade \"A\" on scale of A to F.\nWriting for \"Variety\" magazine, Todd McCarthy observed that the film's success was assisted by its \"highly skilled cast of actors,\" as well as its choice of Lee as director. McCarthy clarified, \"Although [Lee's] previously revealed talents for dramatizing conflicting social and generational traditions will no doubt be noted, Lee's achievement here with such foreign material is simply well beyond what anyone could have expected and may well be posited as the cinematic equivalent of Kazuo Ishiguro writing \"The Remains of the Day\".\"\nMick LaSalle of the \"San Francisco Chronicle\" lauded the film for containing a sense of urgency \"that keeps the pedestrian problems of an unremarkable 18th century family immediate and personal.\" LaSalle concluded that the adaptation has a \"right balance of irony and warmth. The result is a film of great understanding and emotional clarity, filmed with an elegance that never calls attention to itself.\" Film critic John Simon praised most of the film, particularly focusing on Thompson's performance, though he criticised Grant for being \"much too adorably bumbling\u00a0... he urgently needs to chasten his onscreen persona, and stop hunching his shoulders like a dromedary.\" Other major critics such as LaSalle, Roger Ebert, James Berardinelli and Janet Maslin praised Grant's performance. Maslin wrote, Grant \"rises touchingly to the film's most straightforward and meaningful encounters.\"\nJarr Carr of \"The Boston Globe\" thought that Lee \"nail[ed] Austen's acute social observation and tangy satire,\" and viewed Thompson and Winslet's age discrepancy as a positive element that helped feed the dichotomy of sense and sensibility. The \"Radio Times\" David Parkinson was equally appreciative of Lee's direction, writing that he \"avoid[s] the chocolate-box visuals that cheapen so many British costume dramas\" and \"brings a refreshing period realism to the tale of two sisters that allows Emma Thompson's respectful Oscar-winning script to flourish.\"\nAlthough as others have pointed out the adaption is not faithful to Austen's novel: \"Thompson plays fast and loose with Austen, cutting huge chunks out of the novel, adding whole scenes; a mere six or seven lines from the book actually make it into the film\".\nAccolades.\nOut of the 1990s Austen adaptations, \"Sense and Sensibility\" received the most recognition from Hollywood. It garnered seven nominations at the 68th Academy Awards ceremony, where Thompson received the Award for Best Screenplay Based on Material Previously Produced or Published, making her the only person to have won an Oscar for both her writing and acting (Thompson won the Best Actress award for \"Howards End\", in 1993). The film also was the recipient of twelve nominations at the 49th British Academy Film Awards, including Best Film, Best Actress in a Leading Role (for Thompson), and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (for Winslet). In addition, the film won the Golden Bear at the 46th Berlin International Film Festival, making Lee the first director to win this twice.\nDespite the recognition given to the film, Lee was not nominated for the Academy Award for Best Director (though he was nominated for the Golden Globe). The scholar Shu-mei Shih and the journalist Clarence Page have attributed this snub to Hollywood's racism against Lee, and Chinese cinema in general. Lee sought to avoid turning his omission into a scandal and specifically asked the Taiwan state media not to make it a \"national issue,\" explaining that he endured more pressure when forced to act as his country's representative.\nLegacy and influence.\nFollowing the theatrical release of \"Persuasion\" by a few months, \"Sense and Sensibility\" was one of the first English-language period adaptations of an Austen novel to be released in cinemas in over fifty years, the previous being the 1940 film \"Pride and Prejudice\". The year 1995 saw a resurgence of popularity for Austen's works, as \"Sense and Sensibility\" and the serial \"Pride and Prejudice\" both rocketed to critical and financial success. The two adaptations helped draw more attention to the previously little-known 1995 television film \"Persuasion\", and led to additional Austen adaptations in the following years. In 1995 and 1996, six Austen adaptations were released onto film or television. The filming of these productions led to a surge in popularity of many of the landmarks and locations depicted; according to the scholar Sue Parrill, they became \"instant meccas for viewers.\"\nWhen \"Sense and Sensibility\" was released in cinemas in the US, \"Town &amp; Country\" published a six-page article entitled \"Jane Austen's England\", which focused on the landscape and sites shown in the film. A press book released by the studio, as well as Thompson's published screenplay and diaries, listed all the filming locations and helped to boost tourism. Saltram House for instance was carefully promoted during the film's release, and saw a 57 percent increase in attendance. In 1996, JASNA's membership increased by fifty percent. The popularity of both \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" led to the BBC and ITV releasing their Austen adaptations from the 1970s and 1980s onto DVD.\nAs the mid-1990s included adaptations of four Austen novels, there were few of her works to adapt. Andrew Higson argues that this resulted in a \"variety of successors\" in the genres of romantic comedy and costume drama, as well as with films featuring strong female characters. Cited examples include \"Mrs Dalloway\" (1997), \"Mrs. Brown\" (1997), \"Shakespeare in Love\" (1998), and \"Bridget Jones's Diary\" (2001). In 2008, Andrew Davies, the screenwriter of \"Pride and Prejudice\", adapted \"Sense and Sensibility\" for television. As a reaction to what he said was Lee's overly \"sentimental\" film, this production features events found in the novel but excluded from Thompson's screenplay, such as Willoughby's seduction of Eliza and his duel with Brandon. It also features actors closer to the ages in the source material.\n\"Sense and Sensibility\" has maintained its popularity into the twenty-first century. In 2004, Louise Flavin referred to the 1995 film as \"the most popular of the Austen film adaptations,\" and in 2008, \"The Independent\" ranked it as the third-best Austen adaptation of all time, opining that Lee \"offered an acute outsider's insight into Austen in this compelling 1995 interpretation of the book [and] Emma Thompson delivered a charming turn as the older, wiser, Dashwood sister, Elinor.\" Journalist Zoe Williams credits Thompson as the person most responsible for Austen's popularity, explaining in 2007 that \"Sense and Sensibility\" \"is the definitive Austen film and that's largely down to her.\" In 2011, \"The Guardian\" film critic Paul Laity named it his favourite film of all time, partly because of its \"exceptional screenplay, crisply and skilfully done.\". Devoney Looser reflected on the film in \"The Atlantic\" on the 20th anniversary of its release, arguing that the film served as \"a turning point\" for \"pro-feminist masculinity\" in Austen adaptations."}
{"title": "Captain_Marvel_(film)", "label": "Film", "text": "Captain Marvel is a 2019 American superhero film based on Marvel Comics featuring the character Carol Danvers / Captain Marvel. Produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, it is the 21st film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). The film was written and directed by Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, with Geneva Robertson-Dworet also contributing to the screenplay. Brie Larson stars as Carol Danvers, alongside Samuel L. Jackson, Ben Mendelsohn, Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, Lashana Lynch, Gemma Chan, Annette Bening, Clark Gregg, and Jude Law. Set in 1995, the story follows Danvers as she becomes Captain Marvel after Earth is caught in the center of a galactic conflict between two alien civilizations.\nDevelopment of the film began by May 2013. It was officially announced in October 2014 as Marvel Studios' first female-led superhero film. Nicole Perlman and Meg LeFauve were hired to write the film the following April after submitting separate takes on the character, and borrowed elements from Roy Thomas' 1971 \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" comic book storyline. Larson was announced as Danvers at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con, with Boden and Fleck hired to direct in April 2017. Robertson-Dworet was soon hired to re-write the script, with the rest of the cast added by the start of filming. Location shooting began in January 2018, with principal photography starting that March in California and concluding in Louisiana in July 2018. Several actors reprise their roles from previous MCU films in \"Captain Marvel\", including Jackson and Gregg who were digitally de-aged in post-production to reflect the film's 1990s setting.\n\"Captain Marvel\" premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 8, as part of of the MCU. The film grossed over $1.1\u00a0billion worldwide, making it the first female-led superhero film to pass the billion-dollar mark. It became the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019 and was the 23rd-highest-grossing film of all time during its theatrical run. The film received praise for the performances of the cast, particularly that of Larson. A sequel, \"The Marvels\", is scheduled for release on February 17, 2023.\nPlot.\nIn 1995, on the Kree Empire's capital planet of Hala, Starforce member Vers suffers from amnesia and recurring nightmares involving an older woman. Yon-Rogg, her mentor and commander, trains Vers to control her abilities, while the Supreme Intelligence, the artificial intelligence that rules the Kree, urges her to keep her emotions in check. \nDuring a mission to rescue an undercover operative infiltrating a group of Skrulls, alien shapeshifters with whom the Kree are at war, Vers is captured by Skrull commander Talos. A probe of Vers' memories leads them to Earth. Vers escapes and crash-lands in Los Angeles. Her presence attracts S.H.I.E.L.D. agents Nick Fury and Phil Coulson, whose investigation is interrupted by a Skrull attack. Vers recovers a crystal containing her extracted memories in the ensuing chase while Fury kills a Skrull impersonating Coulson.\nTalos, disguised as Fury's boss Keller, orders Fury to work with Vers and keep tabs on her. Using her extracted memories, Vers and Fury go to the Project Pegasus installation at a U.S. Air Force base. They discover that Vers was a pilot presumed to have died in 1989 while testing an experimental light-speed engine designed by Dr. Wendy Lawson, whom Vers recognizes as the woman from her nightmares. Fury informs S.H.I.E.L.D. of their location and a team arrives. Fury realizes that Keller is Talos and helps Vers escape in a jet with Lawson's stowaway cat Goose.\nThey fly to Louisiana to meet former pilot Maria Rambeau, the last person to see Vers and Lawson alive. Rambeau and her daughter Monica reveal that Vers is Carol Danvers, who was once like family to them. Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered blackbox recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.\nDanvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos' family, and the Tesseract, the power source of Lawson's engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. Danvers removes the Kree implant that suppressed her powers during their encounter, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien Flerken. Goose swallows the Tesseract and scratches Fury, blinding his left eye. Danvers destroys a Kree bomber, forcing Kree officer Ronan the Accuser and his squadron to retreat. \nDanvers overpowers Yon-Rogg and sends him to Hala with a warning for the Supreme Intelligence. She then departs to help the Skrulls find a new homeworld, leaving Fury a modified pager to contact her in an emergency. Fury drafts an initiative to locate heroes like Danvers, naming it after her Air Force call sign, \"Avenger\". In a mid-credits scene, set in 2018, the activated pager is being monitored by the Avengers when Danvers appears looking for Fury. In a post-credits scene, Goose climbs onto Fury's desk and vomits the Tesseract.\nCast.\nAdditional members of Starforce include Algenis P\u00e9rez Soto as Att-Lass, the marksman of the team, and Rune Temte as Bron-Char, the \"bigger, stronger guy who fights with his fists\". Maria's daughter, Monica Rambeau, is played by Akira and Azari Akbar as an eleven-year-old and a five-year-old, respectively. Sharon Blynn portrays Soren, Talos' wife. Robert Kazinsky appears as a biker nicknamed \"The Don\". Vik Sahay plays a Torfan, while Chuku Modu portrays the Kree spy Soh-Larr. Colin Ford appears as Danvers' brother, Steve, and Kenneth Mitchell plays their father. Danvers' comic book cat Chewie (named for the \"Star Wars\" character Chewbacca) appears in the film, renamed Goose after the \"Top Gun\" (1986) character Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw. Its name was changed since \"Star Wars\" is a contemporary franchise and not specific to Danvers, unlike the pilot-themed \"Top Gun\". Goose is portrayed by four different cats, each chosen for their actions and personality: Reggie, Archie, Rizzo and Gonzo.\nReal-life Air Force pilots Matthew \"Spider\" Kimmel and Stephen \"Cajun\" Del Bagno appear as themselves. Del Bagno died months prior to the film's release, and it is dedicated to his memory. \"Captain Marvel\" comic book writer Kelly Sue DeConnick makes a cameo appearance as a train station passerby, and Stan Lee, co-creator of Captain Marvel, appears posthumously as himself memorizing the lines for his cameo in \"Mallrats\" (1995). Reprising their MCU roles for the mid-credits scene are Chris Evans as Steve Rogers, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner, and Don Cheadle as James Rhodes.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nBy May 2013, Marvel Studios' writing room had produced a script for a film featuring Ms. Marvel, an alias used by the character Carol Danvers before she took the mantle Captain Marvel. Later that year, executive producer Louis D'Esposito said the studio was interested in a female-driven superhero film and had plenty of \"strong female characters\" from which to choose, suggesting Captain Marvel, Black Widow, Pepper Potts, or Peggy Carter as possible candidates. Kevin Feige, President of Marvel Studios, said that if Marvel was to make a female-led film, he would prefer it to be a new character to the Marvel Cinematic Universe like Captain Marvel, for whom an origin story could be told. In August 2014, Feige stated that development had begun on a Captain Marvel film, and said members of the public asked about the project more often than \"Iron Man 4\" or \"\".\nIn October 2014, Feige announced that \"Captain Marvel\" would be the studio's first female-led film, and would focus on Carol Danvers. It was given a release date of July 6, 2018, as part of their slate of films. Feige said the film had been in development almost as long as \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" (2014) and \"Doctor Strange\" (2016), and one of its biggest challenges would be balancing the title character's \"earthbound\" adventures with her cosmic powers. He said a writer and director for the film would be announced soon, and female filmmakers were being considered for the project, but he could not promise that filmmakers from a certain demographic would be hired for the film.\nIn February 2015, Marvel pushed the release date back to November 2, 2018, to accommodate ' (2017). In early April, Feige revealed that Captain Marvel had been included in an early draft of the ' (2015) screenplay, but Marvel chose to remove this appearance because they did not want to introduce the character before they were able to explore her backstory and personality first. He also said that Marvel would announce writers for the film within a few weeks, and by mid-April, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" co-screenwriter Nicole Perlman and \"Inside Out\" (2015) co-screenwriter Meg LeFauve were announced to be writing the screenplay. The duo were put together as a writing team after impressing Feige with separate takes on the character, and began work on the film within a month. LeFauve found the character being a female superhero to be both \"wonderful\" and a challenge, believing that the character's power-level could lead to the \"Superman curse\" of being perceived to be invulnerable. Additionally, LeFauve and Perlman found that writing a \"story about a human and not get[ting] too overwhelmed by the worry of representing all women\" worked best when approaching the story. An article about young girls who would quit learning to code after they encountered trouble made LeFauve and Perlman consider questions about females being taught they cannot make mistakes or embrace their own power. This helped the duo realize that \"part of embracing your power is failure\" and seeing it \"more as feedback instead of your character\".\nBy May, Marvel had discussions with Ava DuVernay about directing \"Captain Marvel\" or \"Black Panther\" (2018), which Feige confirmed a month later, saying that he had met with DuVernay amongst a number of other directors and expected a decision to be made by mid- to late 2015. That September, Feige said that the casting process would not begin until 2016, as the studio did not want to try to cast Carol Danvers until they had decided on the direction for the character in the screenplay, as well as the structure of the film and the character's role in the rest of Marvel's Phase Three films. Producer Jeremy Latcham elaborated that \"getting the character right first is going to lead the charge\". In October 2015, Marvel changed the release date again, this time moving it to March 8, 2019, to make room for \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" (2018).\nFeige stated in April 2016 that a director would be announced within a few months and that the first cast members would be announced in mid-2016. He also mentioned that the film would be about Carol Danvers becoming Captain Marvel. The next month, indie filmmaker Emily Carmichael's name surfaced as a possible contender to direct the film, and by June, Brie Larson emerged as the frontrunner to play Captain Marvel. Larson's casting was confirmed at the 2016 San Diego Comic-Con. She was set to earn $5\u00a0million for the film. Larson was initially hesitant to accept the role, but \"couldn't deny the fact that this movie is everything I care about, everything that's progressive and important and meaningful, and a symbol I wished I would've had growing up\". She was able to bring to the part \"some of those [deep emotional] things\" she had used in previous, more \"dramatic roles\". Larson felt this would differentiate \"Captain Marvel\" from other superhero films. Also at Comic-Con, Feige said the search for a director had narrowed to ten candidates and he hoped to announce the final choice in the coming months.\nPerlman revealed in August that the character's origin story had been changed for the film because of similarities to the DC Comics character Green Lantern, with Feige explaining that the new story is centered on Danvers finding her limitations and vulnerabilities. He added that Danvers is the most powerful character in the MCU, and would become very important in the franchise. Producer Nate Moore said the film avoids the traditional structure of many MCU origin stories, which he described as a character having a problem before gaining \"powers at the end of the first act, and the end of the second act they learn about the powers, the third act they probably fight a villain who has a function of the same powers\"; instead, Danvers starts the film having already gained her powers.\nIn October 2016, Feige admitted that the announcement for a director was taking longer than he previously expected, and explained that the studio was now waiting for more of the film's story to be defined in the script so they could then talk to potential directors about it. Once again talking about hiring a female filmmaker to direct the film, Feige said that he did not think it would be a requirement to make a \"great version\" of the film, but it was something that Marvel felt was important to consider, even if that female filmmaker did not know a lot about the comics, as \"they just have to fall in love with it once they are presented with it. It's amazing to see all of the filmmakers read through [the source material] and know, 'Oh, a female's writing it now, speaking in particular to Kelly Sue DeConnick's run in the comics. Feige expected a director to be announced by the end of 2016; however, Perlman and LeFauve turned in a script treatment around December, pushing additional meetings with director candidates into early 2017.\nIn February 2017, Perlman stated that despite her and LeFauve being hired almost a year previously, the duo had only recently gotten their \"marching orders\" for the script, stating that one of the reasons for the delay was figuring out where the film would fit within the MCU. Perlman also discussed the character's femininity, feeling that it was important to make sure she is not \"somebody who is a hero in spite of her femininity ... being a woman is part of [her] strength\". The writers were also wary of tropes that could be diminishing to a female character but not for male characters, such as things they would not have been concerned about writing for Iron Man but would not play the same way for Captain Marvel.\nPre-production.\nMarvel hired Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck to direct \"Captain Marvel\" in April 2017, after the duo impressed the studio over numerous meetings with their vision for the character and because of their experience working in both television and film. Feige said that he and Marvel were particularly impressed with Boden and Fleck's ability to create a diverse range of character-driven stories in all of their works. Feige felt the film had to focus on the complexity and relatability of Carol Danvers' character without being bogged down by the villains and the special effects, and thought that Boden and Fleck could provide this character focus. Filming was scheduled to begin in January 2018, at Pinewood Atlanta Studios in Fayette County, Georgia, but Feige said he did not expect it to begin until February.\nBy July 2017, Samuel L. Jackson was set to appear in the film, reprising his role as Nick Fury. Larson, who had worked with Jackson on ' (2017), pushed for Fury's presence in the film. At the 2017 San Diego Comic-Con, Feige revealed that the film would take place in the 1990s and that the Skrulls would be the film's villains, allowing elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" (1971) comic book storyline to be used. By setting the film in the 1990s, Feige noted that Danvers would \"be the singular hero\" while still giving her a definitive placing in the MCU timeline. Executive producer Jonathan Schwartz said setting the film in the 1990s was an idea from early in the development process, and gave the character a special place and significance within the MCU. It also allowed the film to make connections to plot details from past MCU films that are set later in the timeline. Regarding the elements from the \"Kree\u2013Skrull War\" used for the film, Schwartz said some paranoia elements would be featured but would not be related to the Anti-Superhero Act as in the comics. He added that the Kree-Skrull conflict would mostly be a \"backdrop and mythological underpinning\" for the film. In response to the Comic-Con announcements, Graeme McMillan of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" compared the film to ' (2011) and the DC Extended Universe film \"Wonder Woman\" (2017), as they were also set decades before the present day. By setting the film in the 1990s, McMillan felt it would create the question \"what happened to Captain Marvel to take her off the playing field ahead of the Marvel movies that we've seen to date?\"\nAlso in July, the California Film Commission awarded a $20.7million tax credit to the production, going towards the first $100million spent on qualified in-state expenditures, making California the main filming location for \"Captain Marvel\". D'Esposito was excited about this since Marvel Studios' headquarters and post-production facilities are also in the state, allowing them to streamline the production process for this film and others. Awarding of the tax credit was dependent on filming beginning within 180 days. Marvel planned to spend $118.6\u00a0million filming in the state, for a net of $97.8\u00a0million after the tax credit was applied. Schwartz said one of the reasons Los Angeles was chosen for filming was because \"not a lot of big movies shoot in LA anymore, so it weirdly feels like fresh territory for a movie like this\".\nGeneva Robertson-Dworet was hired by mid-August to take over the scripting duties for \"Captain Marvel\" after LeFauve left the project to co-direct \"Gigantic\" for Disney Animation. Perlman also left the project, but stated that the story she and LeFauve had worked on in earlier drafts would be retained in the final screenplay. Robertson-Dworet described the film as an action-comedy, and likened her script to an initial one she wrote for \"Tomb Raider\" (2018) before that film took a more dramatic tone. She added that it was important to the entire creative team to keep the comedic elements of the film and the sassiness of Danvers' character. Robertson-Dworet also credited Boden for helping to shape Danvers' voice in the film and for the desire \"to carve our own path and make sure we weren't retreading the same territory [after the release of \"Wonder Woman\"], and showing all facets of what women are capable of\". Feige added that \"Captain Marvel\" would have action scenes that would pay homage to 1990s action films, including \"\" (1991), since the 1990s action genre was one Marvel Studios had yet to explore. He also stated that much of the film would take place in outer space. \"RoboCop\" (1987), \"The French Connection\" (1971), and \"The Conversation\" (1974) also served as influences on \"Captain Marvel\" for Boden and Fleck. Speaking specifically to \"RoboCop\", the directors were drawn to \"this idea of a character who's finding himself and finding his past\" from that film and how it could connect to the story they were telling in \"Captain Marvel\". DeConnick and quantum physicist Spyridon Michalakis, of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter at the California Institute of Technology, consulted on the film.\nBy October, filming was slated to begin in March 2018. Feige said the film would play a significant role in setting up \"\" (2019), which was set for release after \"Captain Marvel\". Ben Mendelsohn entered negotiations to play the film's main villain, having previously worked with Boden and Fleck on their film \"Mississippi Grind\" (2015). They had him in mind for the \"Captain Marvel\" villain when they first began working on the story, and Mendelsohn agreed to play the role shortly after discussing the film with the directors. By November, Jude Law was in negotiations to join the film, which at the time was reported to be the role of Walter Lawson / Mar-Vell. Keanu Reeves had also been approached for the part but declined. In January 2018, DeWanda Wise was cast as Maria Rambeau, and Mendelsohn and Law were confirmed to have been cast.\nFilming.\nLocation shooting occurred at the end of January 2018. Set photos taken at that time showed Larson in a green-and-black uniform instead of the character's familiar red-and-blue suit. Feige responded by saying that Marvel accepts the risk of set photos being leaked as a consequence of location shooting, and felt that \"most people are savvy enough to know they're looking at a behind-the-scenes photo, completely out of context\". He added that a large number of scenes in the film would be shot on location.\nA month later, Gemma Chan joined the cast as Minn-Erva. In mid-March, Wise withdrew from the film because of a scheduling conflict with her television series \"She's Gotta Have It\". Lashana Lynch entered into negotiations to replace Wise the next day, and was confirmed for the role by the end of the month. At that time, Marvel revealed that Djimon Hounsou, Lee Pace, and Clark Gregg were set to reprise their respective roles of Korath, Ronan the Accuser, and Phil Coulson from earlier MCU films; as those characters were all killed in their previous appearances, Richard Newby of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described the film as a unique opportunity to \"strengthen the presence of [the characters] who may not have lived up to their potential\". Marvel also announced that Algenis Perez Soto, Rune Temte, and Mckenna Grace had been cast, and revealed that Boden, Fleck, and the writing team of Liz Flahive and Carly Mensch had all contributed to the film's screenplay in addition to LeFauve, Perlman, and Robertson-Dworet. Bek Smith, who previously was a member of Marvel's screenwriter program, performed uncredited rewrites during production.\nPrincipal photography began on March 19 in Los Angeles, at Sony Studios under the working title \"Open World\". Schwartz stated that \"Open World\" was chosen because it likened the film to an open world video game that could go in many directions, which is how the production felt about \"Captain Marvel\"s story at the time. A 1986 carnival scene was filmed later that week at the Jim Hall Racing Club in Oxnard, California. Filming of \"Captain Marvel\" in Los Angeles, along with other big-budget films that took advantage of California's improved tax credit program, helped raise on-location feature film production in the area by 11.7% in the first quarter of 2018, compared with the same period in 2017, the first such double-figure increase since the fourth quarter of 2015. Filming at Shaver Lake outside Fresno, California, was set to take place in April but was pushed back to mid-May. In late April, Feige stated that almost half of filming was completed. The following month, Annette Bening joined the cast in an undisclosed role. Additional location shooting in and around the Los Angeles area included Simi Valley, Edwards Air Force Base, and Lucerne Valley. In late June, production moved to Baton Rouge, Louisiana and New Orleans for two weeks. A realistic cat puppet was used on set since Larson is allergic to cats. Scenes featuring the interior of the Quadjet were filmed on the set used to depict the interior of Quinjets on the MCU television series \"Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.\" Filming concluded on July 6.\nCinematographer Ben Davis shot primarily on large-format Arri Alexa 65 cameras, liking how the camera rendered the film's costumes. Davis, who previously served as director of photography for \"Guardians of the Galaxy\", \"Avengers: Age of Ultron\", and \"Doctor Strange\" (2016), noted that there was a \"point of departure\" in the visuals of \"Captain Marvel\" coming from its 1990s setting. To achieve the 1990s aesthetic, Davis first attempted to utilize post-production techniques to convey a period look, but found that it just softened the image. He then tried using vintage Cooke Panchro and Canon K-35 lenses, but they were not compatible with the large format of the Arri Alexa camera system. Davis ultimately enlisted Dan Sasaki of Panavision to make new lenses for the period scenes that could work with the cameras. Davis initially intended not to use these lenses for scenes set in space, to differentiate them, but found himself using the lenses for some close-ups set in space because he liked the way they looked.\nPost-production.\nAdditional photography was confirmed to have begun via set photos in late November 2018. With the release of the theatrical poster in early December, Marvel revealed that the writing team of Joe Shrapnel and Anna Waterhouse had worked on the film's story, while Jac Schaeffer had contributed to the screenplay. Schaeffer had previously been hired by Marvel to write \"Black Widow\" (2021). Bening's and Law's roles were officially confirmed in February 2019 as the Supreme Intelligence and Yon-Rogg, respectively.\nThe film was edited by Elliot Graham and Debbie Berman, marking Berman's third time co-editing an MCU film after \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" and \"Black Panther\". \"Captain Marvel\" was edited using Avid Media Composer software in the Avid DNxHD codec on Apple computers. Berman first became involved with the film when she was working on \"Homecoming\" and Boden and Fleck were hired, and was hired herself for \"Captain Marvel\" the first week she was working on \"Black Panther\". In addition to Graham and Berman, the editing team was made up of first assistants Jessica Baclesse and Kimberly Boritz, second assistants Basuki Juwono and Christos Voutsinas, and assistant editor Joe Galdo, among others. Berman spoke fondly of this large team, feeling that they gave her the opportunity to focus on the film's story rather than the technical aspects of editing.\nVisual effects for the film were created by Animal Logic, Cantina Creative, Digital Domain, Framestore, Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Luma Pictures, Rise, Rising Sun Pictures, Scanline VFX, Trixter, and Elastic, with Lola VFX working on the de-aging of Jackson and Gregg. Lola looked at several of Jackson's films, including \"Pulp Fiction\" (1994), \"Die Hard with a Vengeance\" (1995), \"Jurassic Park\" (1993), \"Loaded Weapon 1\" (1993), and \"One Eight Seven\" (1997), as a reference for his de-aging. However, some of these films were disqualified due to circumstances surrounding the character Jackson was playing: \"Pulp Fiction\" because of the character's wig and facial hair, and \"Jurassic Park\" because the character was made to appear older in that film. Lola VFX supervisor Trent Claus said the final look was based partly on \"Die Hard\" and \"Loaded Weapon 1\", but mostly on \"One Eight Seven\", which he described as the \"hero movie\". Jackson was de-aged approximately 25 years from the age of 70 at the time of filming, to 45 for the 1995 setting. To do this, both Jackson and Gregg had tracking dots applied to their faces during filming for which the VFX team could anchor the \"hand-crafted\" facial features that were composited primarily in Autodesk Flame. Lola's team included 40 primary compositors with another 15\u201320 junior compositors, and created approximately 500 different VFX shots, of which 385 made it in the final cut of film. It was the first time Lola de-aged an actor without using a body double, as it would take too long to re-film all of Fury's scenes with the double.\nTrixster did initial development on the look of Danvers' Binary powers, and contributed the majority of visual effects for Goose the Cat, including movements that were impossible for real-life cats to act. ILM handled Goose's alien features, as well as much of the final battle for which they used Trixter's work on the Binary powers as well as inspiration from comic books and video games. ILM also did work on the Supreme Intelligence's virtual environment alongside Animal Logic, who took inspiration from the interior of the Louvre Abu Dhabi and the work they did with fractals for \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" (2017). These scenes were filmed in a white room without green or blue screen, so Animal Logic had to rotoscope the actors out of the footage and place them in the digital environment. To maintain the quality of the actors' hair during this process, Animal Logic created digital hair for Larson and Bening. Luma Pictures was primarily responsible for the train chase sequence, nicknamed the \"French Connection\" scene after the 1971 film of the same name. They had to make the footage look as if it were continuing along a single train line even though the sequence was filmed in multiple locations around Los Angeles. Digital Domain worked on the Skrull transformation sequences, Rise created the exterior environment of Hala, and Framstore handled the battle sequence on Torfa. Rising Sun handled all of the Kree forearm holograms, the interior of the Project Pegasus hangar, and the exterior of the Quadjet. Scanline worked on effects for the aerial chases and the accident scene where Danvers gains her powers. Elastic created the end titles, and The Third Floor, Inc. provided previsualization and postvisualization work.\nThe film's mid-credits scene shows Captain Marvel meeting the Avengers, and was directed by Anthony and Joe Russo. Boden described it as a lead-in to the Russo's \"Avengers: Endgame\". For \"Captain Marvel\", Marvel Studios modified their production logo to honor Stan Lee, who died on November 12, 2018, by replacing the characters in the logo with Lee's MCU cameos. The logo is followed by a black screen reading \"Thank You Stan\". Feige said this was done because the film was Marvel's first since Lee died, and they wanted to start the film by acknowledging him with a celebration of his legacy rather than add a somber memorial to the end of the film.\nMusic.\nPinar Toprak signed on to compose the film's score in June 2018, making her the first woman to score an MCU film. Toprak began by creating the title character's theme, before developing themes for the Kree and the Skrulls, whom she tried to connect in order to \"find the universe\" for the film's scenes in space and Earth. Toprak wanted Captain Marvel's theme to be recognizable from its first two notes. In addition to Toprak's score, the film's soundtrack includes Alan Silvestri's theme from \"The Avengers\" (2012); Michael Giacchino's Marvel Studios Fanfare, which is played over the Marvel Studios logo and referenced during Stan Lee's cameo appearance; and songs from the 1990s.\nIn April 2019, Mark Salcido of the website \"Screen Geek\" alleged that Marvel and the film's directors had been unhappy with Toprak's work on the film even after she had responded to \"ample\" notes, and had replaced her as composer for the film with Giacchino. Giacchino responded to this report by confirming he was involved in the film, revealing that he had been asked to give feedback on Toprak's work while he was working with Marvel on the score for \"\" (2019). He thought Toprak had written a \"beautiful theme and an inspiring score\" for the film, and had helped her work on \"a few cues\" which he said was him supporting her as a fellow member of the Marvel \"family\". Giacchino made it clear that he \"did not write the score to \"Captain Marvel\" ... bottom line is [Toprak] is a fabulous composer and certainly doesn't need me\".\nMarketing.\nIn 2017, concept art from the film was shown at San Diego Comic-Con, and a first look at Larson as Danvers was revealed at CineEurope. Larson debuted the first trailer for the film that September at the National Air and Space Museum on \"Good Morning America\". Petrana Radulovic of \"Polygon\" felt the trailer showed \"large-scale action and intergalactic mayhem that reaches for \"Infinity War\"s heights\", while Ben Kuchera, also of \"Polygon\", approved of opening the trailer with Blockbuster Video since its logo is identifiable to the audience. Kuchera also compared the \"sun-drenched\" Air Force pilot sequences to \"Top Gun\". Devan Coogan of \"Entertainment Weekly\" called the trailer \"a powerful introduction to the MCU's first solo female hero\". Graeme McMillian of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" felt the prominent narration by Nick Fury \"grounds the trailer in something\u2014some\u2014familiar for the Marvel faithful\", but said the changes to the character's origin story were \"a risky proposition\" to long-time fans of the character. Richard Newby, also of \"The Hollywood Reporter\", noted that the character's unfamiliarity to audiences was not presented as a joke in the trailer as with Marvel's \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" and \"Ant-Man\" (2015), and commended Davis for its more grounded look than previous MCU films. The trailer did receive some criticism, including that the plot presented was unclear, confusion as to why Danvers punches an elderly woman, and objections to Danvers not smiling much. The trailer was viewed 109\u00a0million times in its first 24 hours, becoming the 11th most viewed trailer in that time period.\nThe second trailer debuted on December 3, 2018, during halftime of the \"Monday Night Football\" game between the Washington Redskins and the Philadelphia Eagles. McMillian felt the trailer too overtly responded to online criticisms of the first, including clarification that \"the elderly lady Carol punches was a Skrull\", more shots of her smiling, and \"additional emphasis on both explaining the plot and establishing Carol Danvers as a character\". McMillian compared the contents and structure of the two \"Captain Marvel\" trailers to those for \"Thor\" (2011) and \"Captain America: The First Avenger\". Newby felt the second trailer \"offers increased action and a more in-depth look at the mythology surrounding\" Captain Marvel, but criticized it for not helping to introduce the film's supporting characters. He compared the trailer to a superhero version of John Carpenter's \"Starman\" (1984), explaining, \"Explosions, space battles, and superpowers may bring in the crowds, but it's moments [of] humanity and introspection that will allow \"Captain Marvel\" to leave her mark and encourage audiences to care about the mystery surrounding who she is.\" On December 8, Larson participated in a panel at CCXP in Brazil, where she shared footage and an extended trailer from the film and presented an exclusive poster for the event. By January 3, 2019, \"BoxOffice\" revealed their \"Trailer Impact\" metric service indicated approximately 66\u201370% of people surveyed who viewed the \"Captain Marvel\" trailer in the past two weeks expressed interest in seeing the film. In the two weeks it was measured by \"Trailer Impact\", it was number two for both, behind \"Avengers: Endgame\", and had some of the highest percentage of respondents express interest in seeing the film ever for the service. \"Trailer Impact\" usually includes films 10 weeks out from release, but \"BoxOffice\" decided to add \"Captain Marvel\" to the survey 12 weeks out.\nIn January 2019, the crowdfunding platform GoFundMe announced the #CaptainMarvelChallenge, a campaign to purchase tickets and refreshments for girls and chaperones at the Greater Los Angeles chapter of Girls, Inc. The campaign, inspired by the success of the #BlackPantherChallenge which raised more than $50,000 for children to watch \"Black Panther\", came after Brie Larson suggested on Twitter that there should be a similar campaign for \"Captain Marvel\". For the film's press tour, Larson noted she would be \"pushing for representation across the board: my interviews, magazine covers, the clothes that I'm wearing\" as part of her support for inclusiveness and opposition to sexual harassment in Hollywood. In February, a commercial for the film aired during the television broadcast of Super Bowl LIII. Bruce Fretts of \"The New York Times\" listed the commercial as one of the best advertisements to air during the telecast, stating, \"The commercial introduces a new catchphrase\u2014'higher, further, faster'\u2014and lives up to it with a lightning-quick montage that sets pulses racing.\" CBS charged $5.25\u00a0million for each 30-second advertisement that aired during the game. Also in February, Alaska Airlines unveiled a \"Captain Marvel\"-themed Boeing 737-800 jet, featuring the film's logo on the side and images of Goose the Cat on its wings. The plane debuted at the Seattle\u2013Tacoma International Airport before its first flight to Orange County, California. At the end of the month, an hour-long video of Goose was livestreamed on Marvel's YouTube channel.\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\n\"Captain Marvel\" premiered in London on February 27, 2019, and in Hollywood on March 4. The Hollywood premiere included a flyover by the United States Air Force Thunderbirds in honor of Thunderbirds pilot Major Stephen Del Bagno, who consulted with Larson on the film before dying in a training accident in April 2018. The film was released in IMAX and 3D, in the United States on March 8, coinciding with International Women's Day. It was originally scheduled for release on July 6, 2018, but in February 2015 it was moved to November 2, 2018, to make room for \"\" (2017), and in October 2015 it was pushed to its final March 2019 date for \"Ant-Man and the Wasp\" (2018). The film's release in Pakistan was delayed for four weeks. At the time, Disney's South Asia division, which is headquartered in India, had not given Pakistan the rights to distribute it. Commentators online speculated that this was due to ongoing Indo-Pakistani tensions, but Disney South Asia head Nadeem Mandviwalla called this statement \"baseless\". \"Captain Marvel\" is part of Phase Three of the MCU.\nHome media.\n\"Captain Marvel\" was the first Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures-distributed film not to stream on Netflix, after Disney let their licensing deal with Netflix expire. It became the first theatrical Disney release to stream exclusively on Disney+, which launched on November 12, 2019. The film was released on digital download by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment on May 28, 2019, and on Ultra HD Blu-ray, Blu-ray, and DVD on June 11. The digital and Blu-ray releases include behind-the-scenes featurettes, deleted scenes, and gag reels. \"Captain Marvel\" has made over $64.2 million from video sales in the U.S. The IMAX Enhanced version of the film was made available on Disney+ beginning on November 12, 2021.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Captain Marvel\" grossed in the United States and Canada, and in other territories, for a worldwide total of . It had a worldwide opening of $456.7\u00a0million, the sixth-biggest of all time, and biggest opening for a female-led film. \"Deadline Hollywood\" estimated that the film had a total production and advertising cost of $300\u00a0million. It is the fifth-highest-grossing film of 2019. On April 2, 2019, the film crossed the $1\u00a0billion mark worldwide, becoming the first female-led superhero movie to do so, as well as the seventh Marvel title, the 19th Disney film, and 38th film overall. \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated the film's net profit as $414million, accounting for production budgets, marketing, talent participations, and other costs; box office grosses and home media revenues placed it fifth on their list of 2019's \"Most Valuable Blockbusters\".\nThe film's first 24 hours of advance ticket sales, which began on January 7, 2019, ranked third on Fandango for an MCU film, behind \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Black Panther\", and second on Atom Tickets, behind \"Infinity War\". According to Fandango, \"Captain Marvel\" had the third-largest advanced ticket sales of any MCU film, behind \"Infinity War\" and \"Black Panther\", and surpassed \"Wonder Woman\" and \"Aquaman\" (2018) during the same time period. The film made $61.4\u00a0million on its first day, including $20.7\u00a0million from Thursday night previews, which was the fifth-highest total for a Marvel film and second-highest for a March release behind \"\" (2016). It made $153.4\u00a0million over its opening weekend, the third-best March opening and seventh-highest of the MCU. The film remained in first place during its second weekend, with $69.3\u00a0million, the second-highest sophomore weekend in March behind \"Beauty and the Beast\" (2017). The film grossed $35.2\u00a0million in its third weekend, dropping to second, behind \"Us\". In the following weeks it dropped to third, fifth, sixth, and fourth, before rising to second again in its eighth weekend with the release of \"Avengers: Endgame\".\nOn its first day of international release, the film made $5.9\u00a0million in South Korea and $1.7\u00a0million in France, as well as $2.51\u00a0million from Thursday night previews in China, the fourth-best for an MCU film in the country. Through its first two days of release in foreign territories the film made $44\u00a0million, including $9.1\u00a0million in South Korea, $3\u00a0million in Brazil, $2.9\u00a0million in France and $2.5\u00a0million in Australia. It also grossed $34\u00a0million on its first day in China, the third-best superhero opening day ever in the country. The film went on to have a foreign opening weekend of $302.4\u00a0million, the fifth-best of all time. Its largest markets were China ($89.3\u00a0million), South Korea ($24.1\u00a0million), the UK ($16.8\u00a0million), Brazil ($13.4\u00a0million, the second-best opening of any film in the country's history) and Mexico ($12.8\u00a0million, fifth-best ever). Through its first 12 days of release, the film's highest-grossing foreign countries were China ($135.7\u00a0million), South Korea ($37.5\u00a0million), the United Kingdom ($32.9\u00a0million), Brazil ($26.1\u00a0million) and Mexico ($25.7\u00a0million). By April 2, the film's largest foreign markets were China ($152.3\u00a0million), South Korea ($43.7\u00a0million), the UK ($43.3\u00a0million), Brazil ($34.5\u00a0million) and Mexico ($31.8\u00a0million).\nCritical response.\nThe review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of , with an average score of , based on reviews. The website's critical consensus reads, \"Packed with action, humor, and visual thrills, \"Captain Marvel\" introduces the MCU's latest hero with an origin story that makes effective use of the franchise's signature formula.\" Metacritic, which uses a weighted average, assigned the film a score of 64 out of 100 based on 56 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". According to \"The New York Times\", the film's overall reception was \"fairly positive\", but it wasn't as well-received as other films in the MCU. The \"Hindustan Times\", collating multiple reviews of the film, noted praise for Brie Larson's performance but also criticism for the film's \"convoluted plot and lack of originality\".\nKenneth Turan, writing for the \"Los Angeles Times\", lauded Larson's performance and the direction of Boden and Fleck, saying, \"Marvel has come to recognize, as this film proves, that even effects-heavy behemoths can benefit from a directing touch that is human, not programmatic, that understands character and nuance and can create scenes with an emotional heft we might not expect.\" A.O. Scott of \"The New York Times\" said the film was \"not too long, not too self-important, and benefits from the craft and talent of a cast that includes Annette Bening, Jude Law, and Ben Mendelsohn\". Writing for \"Variety\", Owen Gleiberman also praised the film's direction. He said that Boden and Fleck had not been able to retain their signature style of \"low-key American neorealis[m]\", but was still positive about how they were able to create a film with \"enough tricks and moods and sleight-of-hand layers to keep us honestly absorbed\" within the house style of the MCU. Richard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, and said it was a \"real treat\" to follow the origin stories of both Carol Danvers and Nick Fury. \"Rolling Stone\"s Peter Travers gave it four stars and praised Larson's performance for bringing \"layers of feeling to a role that a lesser actress might have let slide by on pyrotechnics. You see how she lays the foundation for a character who defies male objectification and becomes akin to what Joni Mitchell called 'a woman of heart and mind. Anthony Lane of \"The New Yorker\" stated, \"Superhero cinema has lectured us, ad infinitum, on the responsibility that is conferred by extraordinary gifts. Praise be to Larson, for reminding us that they can be bringers of fun.\"\nTodd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" described the film as \"mundane, marked by unimaginative plotting, cut-rate villains, a bland visual style and a lack of elan in every department\". David Ehrlich at \"IndieWire\" gave the film a 'C\u2013' grade and called it \"neither a blast from the past, nor an inspiring glimpse into the future ... it's just another Marvel movie. And not a particularly good one\". Ehrlich praised Mendelsohn, saying he gave the best performance in the film. Joe Morgenstern of \"The Wall Street Journal\" said Danvers \"is a candidate for genuine heroism\" but found a \"fundamental dissonance between the depth of her plight and the shallow disorganization of the script\". \"The A.V. Club\"s Ignatiy Vishnevetsky was disappointed by the film, finding it to be \"everything you might expect a sci-fi superhero movie to be, if you hadn't seen one in a long time\". Richard Brody of \"The New Yorker\" compared the film to a political commercial that \"packs a worthy message [but] hardly counts as an aesthetic experience. The message of the film is conveyed less through the story than through its casting.\"\nAudience response.\nIn late December 2018, the film was named as the most anticipated 2019 film by IMDb, the most anticipated new standalone comic book film and the second-most anticipated blockbuster of 2019 according to Fandango, and the second-most anticipated superhero and overall film by Atom Tickets.\nAhead of the film's release, \"Captain Marvel\"s \"Want to See\" score\u2014an audience anticipation poll on Rotten Tomatoes\u2014had fallen to 28%. Reports described the decline as an effort by some to review bomb the film's page with negative comments attacking the film and Larson for their perceived feminism. Rotten Tomatoes changed the \"Want to See\" feature shortly after, showing only the number of people indicating interest in the film instead of a percentage. The announcement said this was part of a larger redesign of the site, and that the \"Want to See\" feature would be restored once the film was released. By 8:00\u00a0a.m. on opening day in the United States, the film held a 33% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes from more than 58,000 reviews, which was more audience reviews than \"Avengers: Infinity War\" had during its entire theatrical run. Analysts attributed the low score and sheer number of reviews to online trolling. Rotten Tomatoes later said a bug was responsible for the high count of reviews, and by 1:00\u00a0p.m. the number of counted ratings was down to 7,000 with an audience score of 35%.\nAudiences of the film polled by CinemaScore gave it an average grade of \"A\" on a scale of A+ to F, while PostTrak reported that filmgoers gave it an 84% overall positive score and a 73% \"definite recommend\". 58% said it met their expectations, while 35% said it exceeded them. Unlike \"Wonder Woman\", which was watched by more women than men, \"Captain Marvel\"s initial audience was 61% male, according to PostTrak. Discussing these statistics, \"Deadline Hollywood\"s Anthony D'Alessandro praised CinemaScore and PostTrak for taking scientific polls that actually identified how the audience was feeling about the film, and criticized the Rotten Tomatoes audience score as an \"ancient 1990s means of collecting opinions online\" that is influenced by \"ugly Internet troll noise\".\nSequel.\n\"The Marvels\" is scheduled to be released on February 17, 2023, with Nia DaCosta directing and Megan McDonnell writing the script. Larson reprises her role, and is joined by Iman Vellani as Kamala Khan / Ms. Marvel and Teyonah Parris as a grown-up Monica Rambeau, both reprising their roles from Disney+ series. Zawe Ashton appears as the villain."}
{"title": "Military_history_of_African_Americans", "label": "Film", "text": "The military history of African Americans spans from the arrival of the first enslaved Africans during the colonial history of the United States to the present day. In every war fought by or within the United States, African Americans participated, including the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, the Mexican\u2013American War, the Civil War, the Spanish\u2013American War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, the Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the Iraq War.\nRevolutionary War.\nAfrican Americans, both as slaves and freemen, served on both sides of the Revolutionary War. Gary Nash reports that recent research concludes there were about 9,000 black soldiers who served on the American side, counting the Continental Army and Navy, state militia units, as well as privateers, wagoneers in the Army, servants, officers and spies. Ray Raphael notes that while thousands did join the Loyalist cause, \"A far larger number, free as well as slave, tried to further their interests by siding with the patriots.\"\nBlack soldiers served in Northern militias from the outset, but this was forbidden in the South, where slave-owners feared arming slaves. Lord Dunmore, the Royal Governor of Virginia, issued an emancipation proclamation in November 1775, promising freedom to runaway slaves who fought for the British; Sir Henry Clinton issued a similar edict in New York in 1779. Over 100,000 slaves escaped to British lines, although only roughly 1,000 served on the front lines. Many Black Loyalist migrated to Nova Scotia and later to Sierra Leone. Many of the Black Loyalists performed military service in the British Army, particularly as part of the only Black regiment of the war, the Black Pioneers, and others served non-military roles.\nIn response, and because of manpower shortages, Washington lifted the ban on black enlistment in the Continental Army in January 1776. All-black units were formed in Rhode Island and Massachusetts; many were slaves promised freedom for serving in lieu of their masters; another all-African-American unit came from Haiti with French forces. At least 5,000 African-American soldiers fought as Revolutionaries, and at least 20,000 served with the British.\nPeter Salem and Salem Poor are the most noted of the African-American Patriots during this era, and Colonel Tye was perhaps the most noteworthy Black Loyalist.\nAfrican Americans also served with various of the South Carolina guerrilla units, including that of the \"Swamp Fox\", Francis Marion, half of whose force sometimes consisted of free Blacks. These Black troops made a critical difference in the fighting in the swamps, and kept Marion's guerrillas effective even when many of his white troops were down with malaria or yellow fever.\nThe first black American to fight in the Marines was John Martin, also known as Keto, the slave of a Delaware man, recruited in April 1776 without his owner's permission by Captain of the Marines Miles Pennington of the Continental brig USS \"Reprisal\". Martin served with the Marine platoon on the \"Reprisal\" for a year and a half and took part in many ship-to-ship battles including boardings with hand-to-hand combat, but he was lost with the rest of his unit when the brig sank in October 1777. At least 12 other black men served with various American Marine units in 1776\u20131777; more may have been in service but not identified as blacks in the records. However, in 1798 when the United States Marine Corps (USMC) was officially re-instituted, Secretary of War James McHenry specified in its rules: \"No Negro, Mulatto or Indian to be enlisted\". Marine Commandant William Ward Burrows instructed his recruiters regarding USMC racial policy, \"You can make use of Blacks and Mulattoes while you recruit, but you cannot enlist them.\" The policy was formulated to set a higher standard of unit cohesion for Marines, with the unit to be made up of only one race, so that the members would remain loyal, maintain shipboard discipline and help put down mutinies. The USMC maintained this policy until 1942.\nWar of 1812.\nDuring the War of 1812, about one-quarter of the personnel in the American naval squadrons of the Battle of Lake Erie were black, and portrait renderings of the battle on the wall of the nation's Capitol and the rotunda of Ohio's Capitol show that blacks played a significant role in it. Hannibal Collins, a freed slave and Oliver Hazard Perry's personal servant, is thought to be the oarsman in William Henry Powell's \"Battle of Lake Erie\". Collins earned his freedom as a veteran of the Revolutionary War, having fought in the Battle of Rhode Island. He accompanied Perry for the rest of Perry's naval career, and was with him at Perry's death in Trinidad in 1819.\nNo legal restrictions regarding the enlistment of blacks were placed on the Navy because of its chronic shortage of manpower. The law of 1792, which generally prohibited enlistment of blacks in the Army became the United States Army's official policy until 1862. The only exception to this Army policy was Louisiana, which gained an exemption at the time of its purchase through a treaty provision, which allowed it to opt out of the operation of any law, which ran counter to its traditions and customs. Louisiana permitted the existence of separate black militia units which drew its enlistees from freed blacks.\nA militia unit, In Louisiana, the 2nd Battalion of Free Men of Color, was a unit of black soldiers from Santo Domingo led by a Black free man and Santo-Domingue emigre Joseph Savary offered their services and were accepted by General Andrew Jackson in the Battle of New Orleans, a victory that was achieved after the war was officially over.\nBlacks fought at the Battle of Bladensburg August 24, 1814, many as members of Commodore Joshua Barney's naval flotilla force. This force provided crucial artillery support during the battle. One of the best accounts is that by Charles Ball (born 1785). Ball served with Commodore Joshua at the Battle of Bladensburg and later helped man the defenses at Baltimore. In his 1837 memoir, Ball reflected on the Battle of Bladensburg: \"I stood at my gun, until the Commodore was shot down\u2026 if the militia regiments, that lay upon our right and left, cold have been brought to charge the British, in close fight, as they crossed the bridge, we should have killed or taken the whole of them in a short time; but the militia ran like sheep chased by dogs.\" Barney's flotilla group included numerous African Americans who provided artillery support during the battle. Modern scholars estimate blacks made up between 15 and 20%, of the American naval forces in the War of 1812.\nJust before the battle Commodore Barney on being asked by President James Madison \"if his negroes would not run on the approach of the British?\" replied: \"No Sir\u2026they don't know how to run; they will die by their guns first.\" The Commodore was correct, the men did not run, one such man was young sailor Harry Jones (no.35), apparently a free black. Harry Jones was wounded in the final action at Bladensburg. Due to the severity of Jones wounds, he remained a patient at the Naval Hospital Washington DC for nearly two months.\nAfrican Americans also served with the British. On April 2, 1814, Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane issued a proclamation to all persons wishing to emigrate, similar to the aforementioned Dunmore's Proclamation some 40 years previous. Any persons would be received by the British, either at a military outpost or aboard British ships; those seeking sanctuary could enter His Majesty's forces, or go \"as free settlers to the British possessions in North America or the West Indies\". Among those who went to the British, some joined the Corps of Colonial Marines, an auxiliary unit of marine infantry, embodied on May 14, 1814. British commanders later stated the new marines fought well at Bladensburg and confirm that two companies took part in the burning of Washington including the White House. Following the Treaty of Ghent, the British kept their promise and in 1815 evacuated the Colonial Marines and their families to Halifax Canada and Bermuda.\n1815 to 1840.\n\"Despite Southern attempts to restrict their movements with the Negro Seaman Acts, African American sailors continued to enlist in the Navy in substantial numbers throughout the 1820s and 1830s.\" From the Treaty of Ghent to the Mexican-American War, African Americans made up a significant part of the peacetime navy.Data collected by Dr. Elnathan Judson USN, for his 1823 report, to the Secretary of the Navy,contains detailed information re the number of seamen vaccinated in the Boston area. This report which covers four months listed 161 men and boys of which, Dr. Judson enumerated 30 as black or 18.7% of the total. Commodore William Bainbridge in a 14 September 1827 letter to Secretary of the Navy Samuel L. Southhard, reported 102 men had been received from the Philadelphia area of which 18 were Black or 17.6%. Bainbridge concluded by informing the Southard \"I ordered the Recruiting Officer not to enter anymore until further notice.\" Data for 1839 was collected by Commodore Lewis Warrington and forwarded to the Secretary of the Navy as a memorandum with the number of recruits from 1 September 1838 to September 17, 1839. This document provides data for five naval recruiting stations which in total reflect 1016 men entered or naval service, \"of which 122 were Black\" or 12% of the total.\nMexican\u2013American War.\nA number of African Americans in the Army during the Mexican\u2013American War were servants of the officers who received government compensation for the services of their servants or slaves. Also, soldiers from the Louisiana Battalion of Free Men of Color participated in this war. African Americans also served on a number of naval vessels during the Mexican\u2013American War, including the USS \"Treasure\", and the USS \"Columbus\".\nThe involvement of African Americans in this war was one where they were not included as actual soldiers. There were however, a few cases of African Americans joining in the fighting and these people became known as \"Black Toms\". Many slaves that were brought into assist the army officers escaped to Mexico. However, whenever the American Army would encounter these African Americans they viewed them as stolen property and dissolved them back into the racial hierarchy of the army.\nAmerican Civil War.\nThe history of African Americans in the U.S. Civil War is marked by 186,097 (7,122 officers, 178,975 enlisted) African-American men, comprising 163 units, who served in the Union Army during the Civil War, and many more African Americans served in the Union Navy. Both free African Americans and runaway slaves joined the fight.\nOn the Confederate side, blacks, both free and slave, were used for labor. In the final months of the war, the Confederate Army was desperate for additional soldiers so the Confederate Congress voted to recruit black troops for combat; they were to be promised their freedom. Units were in training when the war ended, and none served in combat.\nIndian Wars.\nFrom 1863 to the early 20th century, African-American units were utilized by the Army to combat the Native Americans during the Indian Wars. The most noted among this group were the Buffalo Soldiers:\nAt the end of the U.S. Civil War the army reorganized and authorized the formation of two regiments of black cavalry (the 9th and 10th US Cavalry). Four regiments of infantry (the 38th, 39th, 40th and 41st US Infantry) were formed at the same time. In 1869, the four infantry regiments were merged into two new ones (the 24th and 25th US Infantry). These units were composed of black enlisted men commanded by white officers such as Benjamin Grierson, and occasionally, an African-American officer such as Henry O. Flipper. The \"Buffalo Soldiers\" served a variety of roles along the frontier from building roads to guarding the U.S. mail.\nThese regiments served at a variety of posts in the southwest United States and Great Plains regions. During this period they participated in most of the military campaigns in these areas and earned a distinguished record. Thirteen enlisted men and six officers from these four regiments earned the Medal of Honor during the Indian Wars.\nSpanish\u2013American War.\nAfter the Indian Wars ended in the 1890s, the regiments continued to serve and participated in the Spanish\u2013American War (including the Battle of San Juan Hill), where five more Medals of Honor were earned. They took part in the 1916 Punitive Expedition into Mexico and in the Philippine\u2013American War.\nUnits.\nIn addition to the African Americans who served in regular army units during the Spanish\u2013American War, five African-American Volunteer Army units and seven African-American National Guard units served.\nVolunteer Army:\nNational Guard:\nOf these units, only the 9th U.S., 8th Illinois, and 23rd Kansas served outside the United States during the war. All three units served in Cuba and suffered no losses to combat.\nPhilippine\u2013American War.\nAfter the Treaty of Paris, the islands of the Philippines became a colony of the United States. When the U.S. military started to send soldiers into the islands, native rebels, who had already been fighting their former Spanish rulers, opposed U.S. colonization and retaliated, causing an insurrection. In what would be known as the Philippine\u2013American War, the U.S. military also sent colored regiments and units to stop the insurrection. However, due to the discrimination of African-American soldiers, some of them defected to the Philippine Army.\nOne of those that defected was David Fagen, who was given the rank of captain in the Philippine Army. Fagen served in the 24th Regiment of the U.S. Army, but on November 17, 1899, he defected to the Filipino army. He became a successful guerrilla leader and his capture became an obsession to the U.S. military and American public. His defection was likely the result of differential treatment by American occupational forces toward black soldiers, as well as common American forces derogatory treatment and views of the Filipino occupational resistance, who were frequently referred to as \"niggers\" and \"gugus\".\nAfter two other black deserters were captured and executed, President Theodore Roosevelt announced he would stop executing captured deserters. As the war ended, the US gave amnesties to most of their opponents. A substantial reward was offered for Fagen, who was considered a traitor. There are two conflicting versions of his fate: one is that his was the partially decomposed head for which the reward was claimed, the other is that he took a local wife and lived peacefully in the mountains.\nWorld War I and Interwar Period.\nWhen the war broke out, several African-Americans joined Allied armies. Most notably, Eugene Bullard and Bob Scanlon joined the French Foreign Legion within weeks of the start of the war. Of the twelve African-Americans who joined the Legion at the start, only two survived the war.\nThe U.S. armed forces remained segregated through World War I as a matter of policy and practice, and despite the effort of Black leadership to overcome that discrimination. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) had been formed in 1909 to move Black equality of opportunity forward, but with the declaration of war in 1917 civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois declared an acceptable fall-back in the effort. \u201cFirst your country, then your rights!\u201d became the NAACP slogan.\nThe optimistic belief was that by serving valiantly in the nation's war effort Blacks would gain the respect and equality that had been elusive thus far. But it was pitted against an underlying unwillingness by the War Department to become a vehicle for social change. Secretary of War Newton D. Baker had made it clear that, though African Americans would be fairly treated in the military, the department could not \u201cundertake at this time to settle the so-called race question.\u201d Instead, the practices that limited equality and opportunity in civilian society were carried over to military society.\nProspective Black enlistees in the war effort were turned away, in large part because there were not enough segregated Black units to take them in. Those Blacks who were successfully enlisted were kept in the same restricted channels of their civil lives. Segregated transportation took them to segregated military bases and regiments that were rarely deployed to much more than the tasks of support and maintenance. And in those jobs they were subject to treatment of indignities by white officers such as, eating in the rain, having no facilities to wash clothes or bath, no toilets and sleeping in tents with no floors. Still, many African Americans volunteered to join the military following America's entry into the war. By the time of the armistice with Germany on November 11, 1918, over 200,000 African Americans had served with the American Expeditionary Force on the Western Front, while 170,000 remained in the United States.\nThough most African-American units were largely relegated to support roles and did not see combat, some African Americans played a notable role in America's war effort. For example, the 369th Infantry Regiment, known as the \"Harlem Hellfighters\", was assigned to the French Army and served on the front lines for six months. 171 members of the 369th were awarded the Legion of Merit.\nGermany attempted to sway the African American troops with propaganda challenging their race-related rights back in the United States.\nCorporal Freddie Stowers of the 371st Infantry Regiment that was seconded to the 157th French Army division called the Red Hand Division in need of reinforcement under the command of the General Mariano Goybet was posthumously awarded a Medal of Honor\u2014the only African American to be so honored for actions in World War I. During action in France, Stowers had led an assault on German trenches, continuing to lead and encourage his men even after being twice wounded. Stowers died from his wounds, but his men continued the fight and eventually defeated the German troops. Stowers was recommended for the Medal of Honor shortly after his death, but the nomination was, according to the Army, misplaced. In 1990, under pressure from Congress, the Department of the Army launched an investigation. Based on findings from this investigation, the Army Decorations Board approved the award of the Medal of Honor to Stowers. , On April 24, 1991\u201373 years after he was killed in action\u2014Stowers' two surviving sisters received the Medal of Honor from President George H. W. Bush at the White House. The success of the investigation leading to Stowers' Medal of Honor later sparked a similar review that resulted in six African Americans being posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for actions in World War II. Vernon Baker was the only recipient who was still alive to receive his award.\nUnits.\nSome of the African-American units that served in World War I were:\nSupport units included:\nA complete list of African-American units that served in the war is published in the book \"Willing Patriots: Men of Color in World War One\". The book is cited in the \"Further reading\" section of this article.\nAfrican Americans Veterans faced heavy persecution when they returned home from World War I and many African American veterans were lynched after returning from WWI. The prediction of equality by W.E.B. Du Bois and the NAACP would not be realized, and racial antagonism was expanded by the claims that any talk of Black valor and positive contribution were lies meant to cover up cowardice and incompetence, which was counteracted by claims of prejudiced and harmful white leadership and the use of Blacks as cannon fodder for white troops that followed them into combat.\nExperience of Soldiers in France.\nAfrican Americans were typically placed into labour battalions with around 160,000 of the 200,000 African Americans who were shipped out to France in 1917 finding themselves placed in one. These labour battalions were viewed as being the \u2018dregs of the military forces\u2019 and the men in them were \u2018driven to the brink of physical and emotional exhaustion\u2019. Jim Crow was extended to the camps where the African American soldiers were stationed and white officers would frequently remind African American soldiers of this. The 370th Infantry Regiment were informed a black member of a labour battalion had recently been hanged in the same square the unit was now assembling in a small town outside the Lorraine region.\nIn support of an attempt to impose American racial policy on France, an extraordinary memo was received by the mayors of the Meuse division upon the arrival of the African American 372nd Infantry Regiment (The \u201cRed Hand\u201d) in 1918. It asked that the French not complicate the life from which the soldiers had come in America by integrating with them socially.\n\"The question is of great importance to the French people and even more so to the American towns, the population of which will be affected later when the troops return to the United States. It therefore becomes necessary for both the colored and white races that undo mixing of these two be circumspectly prevented.\" \nThe request was not generally honored by the French.\nThe way in which they were treated by white Americans in France created a stark contrast between the way in which they were treated by French troops and civilians who treated them more like equals. The result of this contrast was mass disillusionment amongst the African American soldiers which was something many carried with them when they returned home from the war.\nAfrican American soldiers interacted with colonial troops stationed in France, they had already read about them in African American newspapers, the French military had reframed the debate for African Americans at home, France saw black people as having an \u2018important combatant role in the defence of the nation.\u2019 These stories and experiences fuelled African American racial pride which contributed to their mass disillusionment when returning home.\nYMCA services in France were also segregated sixty African American y-secretaries, among them twenty-three African American women served the 200,000 black soldiers stationed in France, only three of these arrived before the armistice \u2013 including Addie W. Hunton and Kathryn M. Johnson. The YMCA work provided entertainment, recreation, and education to the vast majority of African American troops as they had more time on their hands since they served in labor battalions.\nAfrican American WWI veterans role in the civil rights movement:\nAccording to the historian Chad L Williams, \u2018African American soldiers' experiences in the war and their battles with the pervasive racial discrimination in the U.S. military informed their postwar disillusionment and subsequent racial militancy as veterans\u2019. Examples of this racial militancy can be seen in the prominent roles which some African American WWI veterans played in the civil rights movement. For example, William N. Colston, an African American veteran who had served in the 367th infantry during the war, published several essays in the US's leading radical African American magazine- the Messenger. These articles aimed to illustrate the experiences which African Americans soldiers had throughout the war. African American's wartime experiences also played a key role in the formation of the League for Democracy which was a Civil Rights movement formed by African American soldiers serving in the 92nd Division with its key aim being to combat racial discrimination within the military.\nSecond Italo-Abyssinian War.\nOn October 4, 1935, Fascist Italy invaded Ethiopia. Being the only non-colonized African country besides Liberia, the invasion of Ethiopia caused a profound response amongst African Americans. In New York City, clashes took place between African Americans and the Italian immigrant community, many of whom vocally supported Mussolini's invasion. A rally held at Madison Square Garden on Sept. 26, less than a week before the invasion, brought out more than 10,000 to hear civil rights leader W.E.B. Du Bois, Paul Robeson and others speak about the impending disaster. Samuel Daniels, head of the Pan-African Reconstruction Association, toured major American cities to recruit volunteers. African Americans organized to raise money for medical supplies, and several thousand volunteered to fight for the African kingdom. Most volunteers were blocked from leaving the United States due to the American government's desire to remain neutral in the conflict.\nVolunteer John C. Robinson, a pilot and graduate of Tuskeegee University, made his way to Ethiopia to assist with training pilots for Ethiopia's new air force. Ethiopian Emperor Haile Selassie soon personally named Robinson commander of the entire air force. Robinson was given the nickname the \"Brown Condor\" by Ethiopian forces for his service.\nMany years later Haile Selassie I would comment on the efforts: \"We can never forget the help Ethiopia received from Negro Americans during the crisis. ... It moved me to know that Americans of African descent did not abandon their embattled brothers, but stood by us.\"\nSpanish Civil War.\nWhen General Franco rebelled against the newly established secular Spanish Republic, a number of African Americans volunteered to fight for Republican Spain. Many African Americans who were in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade had Communist ideals. Among these, there was Vaughn Love who went to fight for the Spanish loyalist cause because he considered Fascism to be the \"enemy of all black aspirations.\"\nAfrican-American activist and World War I veteran Oliver Law, fought in the Abraham Lincoln Brigade during the Spanish Civil War\nJames Peck was an African-American man from Pennsylvania who was turned down when he applied to become a military pilot in the US. He then went on to serve in the Spanish Republican Air Force until 1938. Peck was credited with shooting down five Aviaci\u00f3n Nacional planes, two Heinkel He-51s from the Legion Condor and three Fiat CR.32 Fascist Italian fighters.\nSalaria Kea was a young African-American nurse from Harlem Hospital who served as a military nurse with the American Medical Bureau in the Spanish Civil War. She was one of the two only African-American female volunteers in the midst of the war-torn Spanish Republican areas. When Salaria came back from Spain she wrote the pamphlet \"A Negro Nurse in Spain\" and tried to raise funds for the beleaguered Spanish Republic.\nWorld War II.\nThe Pittsburgh Courier was one of the most influential African American newspapers of WW II, and the source of what came to be called the Double V Campaign. A letter to the editor of the paper in 1941 asked why a \u201chalf American\u201d should sacrifice his life in the war and suggested that Blacks should seek a double victory. \u201cThe first V for a victory over our enemies from without, the second V for a victory over our enemies from within.\u201d The idea would become a national cause, and eventually extend into a call for action in the factories and services that supported the war effort.\nDespite a high enlistment rate in the U.S. Army, African Americans were still not treated equally. At parades, church services, in transportation and canteens the races were kept separate. A quota of only 48 nurses was set for African-American women, and the women were segregated from white nurses and white soldiers for much of the war. Eventually more black nurses enlisted. They were assigned to care for black soldiers. Black nurses were integrated into everyday life with their white colleagues.\nThe first African-American woman sworn into the Navy Nurse Corps was Phyllis Mae Dailey, a Columbia University student from New York. She was the first of only four African-American women to serve as a Navy nurse during World War II.\nMany black American soldiers served their country with distinction during World War II. There were 125,000 African Americans who were overseas in World War II (6.25% of all abroad soldiers). Famous segregated units, such as the Tuskegee Airmen and 761st Tank Battalion and the lesser-known but equally distinguished 452nd Anti-Aircraft Artillery Battalion, proved their value in combat, leading to desegregation of all U.S. armed forces by order of President Harry S. Truman in July 1948 via Executive Order 9981.\nBenjamin O. Davis, Jr. served as commander of the Tuskegee Airmen during the war. He later went on to become the first African-American general in the United States Air Force. His father, Benjamin O. Davis, Sr., had been the first African-American brigadier general in the Army (1940).\nDoris Miller, a Navy mess attendant, was the first African-American recipient of the Navy Cross, awarded for his actions during the attack on Pearl Harbor. Miller had voluntarily manned an anti-aircraft gun and fired at the Japanese aircraft, despite having no prior training in the weapon's use.\nOn April 14, 1943, Joseph C. Jenkins became the first African-American commissioned officer in the United States Coast Guard. He was joined first by Clarence Samuels on August 31, 1943, and then by Harvey C. Russell Jr. in February 1944.\nIn March 1944, the Golden Thirteen became the Navy's first African-American commissioned officers. Samuel L. Gravely, Jr. became a commissioned officer the same year; he would later be the first African American to command a US warship, and the first to be an admiral.\nThe Port Chicago disaster on July 17, 1944, was an explosion of about 2,000 tons of ammunition as it was being loaded onto ships by black Navy sailors under pressure from their white officers to hurry. The explosion in Northern California killed 320 military and civilian workers, most of them black. It led a month later to the Port Chicago Mutiny, the only case of a full military trial for mutiny in the history of the U.S. Navy against 50 African-American sailors who refused to continue loading ammunition under the same dangerous conditions. The trial was observed by the then young lawyer Thurgood Marshall and ended in conviction of all of the defendants. The trial was immediately and later criticized for not abiding by the applicable laws on mutiny, and it became influential in the discussion of desegregation.\nDuring World War II, African-American soldiers served in all fields of service. In the midst of the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944, General Eisenhower was severely short of replacement troops for existing all-white companies. Consequently, he made the decision to allow 2000 black servicemen volunteers to serve in segregated platoons under the command of white lieutenants to replenish these companies. These platoons would serve with distinction and, according to an Army survey in the summer of 1945, 84% were ranked \"very well\" and 16% were ranked \"fairly well\". No black platoon received a ranking of \"poor\" by those white officers or white soldiers that fought with them. These platoons were often subject to racist treatment by white military units in occupied Germany and were quickly sent back to their old segregated units after the end of hostilities in Germany. Despite their protests, these brave African-American soldiers ended the war in their old non-combat service units. Though largely forgotten after the war, the temporary experiment with black combat troops proved a success - a small, but important step toward permanent integration during the Korean War. A total of 708 African Americans were killed in combat during World War II.\nIn 1945, Frederick C. Branch became the first African-American United States Marine Corps officer.\nA blue plaque commemorating the contribution of African-American soldiers based in Wales during World War II was installed by the Nubian Jak Community Trust at RAF Carew Cheriton on the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, June 6, 2019.\nThe presence of African-American soldiers in the U.K. and subsequent encounters with the native population has been shown to have reduced the racial prejudice against black people if even decades later, and, for the most part, African American soldiers were more welcome in the countries of European Allies than U.S. officials wished them to be. But they were not welcome in some other parts of the world, which became a problem to be solved for Brig. Gen Dwight D. Eisenhower. In 1942, he told the War Department that, by his research, Black troops would not be welcomed for various reasons in Australia, Alaska, most of the south Caribbean nations, the British West Indies, Panama and Liberia. And U.S. military leaders themselves did not want them in Iceland, Greenland, Labrador and the British Isles. The War Department response to the information was mixed, and by 1944 the war had progressed into a need for all troops that could be deployed.\nAs in World War I, Black soldiers were primarily channeled to support labor, most of them as members of the Quartermaster Corps. Among the most crucial and difficult of Quartermaster responsibilities was burial of the dead and the construction of temporary and permanent cemeteries. The best-known work of the Quartermaster Corps in World War II was the brief Red Ball Express, which ferried food, supplies and fuel along the rapid advance of Allied forces from the Normandy Invasion to the incursion into Germany.\nSix thousand trucks operating 24 hours a day, most with two African American drivers on circular routes carried 400,000 tons of supplies through increasingly liberated Europe between August 25 and November 16, 1944. The work was relentless, exhausting and dangerous, and credited with helping to bring about the ultimate success of the Normandy Invasion. A 1952 movie, \u201cThe Red Ball Express,\u201d brought more attention to the effort, but underplayed its African American aspect.\nUnits.\nArmy:\nArmy Air Corps:\nUnited States Marine Corps\nUnited States Navy\n United States \nNavy Seabees\nIn February 1942 CNO Admiral Harold Rainsford Stark recommended African Americans for ratings in the construction trades. In April the Navy announced it would enlist African Americans in the Seabees. Even so, there were just two CBs that were \"colored\" units, the 34th and 80th. Both had white Southern officers and black enlisted. Both battalions experienced problems with that arrangement that led to the replacement of the officers. The men of the 34th went on a hunger strike which made national news. The Commander of the 80th had 19 enlisted dishonorably discharged for sedition. The NAACP and Thurgood Marshall got 14 of those reversed. In 1943 the Navy drew up a proposal to raise the number of colored CBs to 5 and require that all non-rated men in the next 24 CBs be colored. The proposal was approved, but not acted on.\nThe lack of stevedores in combat zones was a huge issue for the Navy. Authorization for the formation of cargo handling CBs or \"Special CBs\" happened mid-September 1942. By wars end 41 Special CBs had been commissioned of which 15 were \"colored\". They were the first fully integrated units in the U.S. Navy. V-J Day brought the decommissioning of all of them. The Special CBs were forerunners of today's Navy Cargo Handling Battalions of the Navy Expeditionary Logistics Support Group (United States). The arrival of 15 colored Special CBs in Pearl Harbor made segregation an issue for the Navy. For some time the men slept in tents, but the disparity of treatment was obvious even to the Navy. The 14th Naval District felt they deserved proper shelter with at least separate but equal barracks. Manana Barracks and Waiawa Gulch became the United States' largest colored military installation with over 4,000 Seabee stevedores segregated there. It was the site of racial strife to the point that the camp was fenced in and placed under armed guard. The Seabees would be trucked back and forth to the docks in cattle trucks. Two naval supply depots were located at Waiawa Gulch.\nOf note were the actions of the 17th Special Naval Construction Battalion and the 16th Marine Field Depot on Peleliu, September 15\u201318, 1944. On D-Day the 7th Marines were in a situation where there were not enough of them to man the lines and get the wounded to safety. Coming to their aid were the two companies of the 16th Marine Field Depot(segregated) and the 17th Special Seabee (segregated). That night the Japanese mounted a counter-attack at 0200 hours. The Field Depot Marines are recorded as again having humped ammunition, to the front lines on the stretchers they brought the wounded back on and picked up rifles to become infantrymen. By the time it was over nearly the entire 17th CB had volunteered alongside them. The Seabee record states that besides humping ammo and helping wounded they volunteered to man the line where the wounded had been, man 37mm artillery that had lost gun crews and volunteered for anything dangerous. The 17th remained with the 7th Marines until the right flank had been secured D-plus 3. According to the Military History Encyclopedia on the Web, were it not for the \"Black Marine shore party personal\" the counterattack on the 7th Marines would not have been repulsed.\nOn Okinawa the 34th CB worked with the 36th CB constructing Awase Airfield once the rains allowed work to go forward. The 34th also built the Joint Communications Station at Awase. Today the Navy maintains a Low Frequency communications station for submarines on the site created by the 34th CB.\nMedal of Honor recipients.\nOn January 13, 1997, President Bill Clinton, in a White House ceremony, awarded the nation's highest military honor\u2014the Medal of Honor\u2014to seven African-American servicemen who had served in World War II.\nThe only living recipient was First Lieutenant Vernon Baker.\nThe posthumous recipients were:\nBlue discharges.\nAfrican-American troops faced discrimination in the form of the disproportionate issuance of blue discharges. The blue discharge (also called a \"blue ticket\") was a form of administrative discharge created in 1916 to replace two previous discharge classifications, the administrative discharge without honor and the \"unclassified\" discharge. It was neither honorable nor dishonorable. Of the 48,603 blue discharges issued by the Army between December 1, 1941, and June 30, 1945, 10,806 were issued to African Americans. This accounts for 22.2% of all blue discharges, when African Americans made up 6.5% of the Army in that time frame. Blue discharge recipients frequently faced difficulties obtaining employment and were routinely denied the benefits of the G. I. Bill by the Veterans Administration (VA). In October 1945, Black-interest newspaper \"The Pittsburgh Courier\" launched a crusade against the discharge and its abuses. Calling the discharge \"a vicious instrument that should not be perpetrated against the American Soldier\", the \"Courier\" rebuked the Army for \"allowing prejudiced officers to use it as a means of punishing Negro soldiers who do not like specifically unbearable conditions\". The \"Courier\" printed instructions on how to appeal a blue discharge and warned its readers not to quickly accept a blue ticket out of the service because of the negative effect it would likely have on their lives.\nThe House Committee on Military Affairs held hearings in response to the press crusade, issuing a report in 1946 that sharply criticized its use and the VA for discriminating against blue discharge holders. Congress discontinued the blue discharge in 1947, but the VA continued its practice of denying G. I. Bill benefits to blue-tickets.\nIntegration of the armed forces.\nOn July 26, 1948, President Harry S. Truman signed Executive Order 9981 integrating the military and mandating equality of treatment and opportunity. It also made it illegal, per military law, to make a racist remark. Desegregation of the military was not complete for several years, and all-black Army units persisted well into the Korean War. The last all-black unit was not disbanded until 1954.\nIn 1950, Lieutenant Leon Gilbert of the still-segregated 24th Infantry Regiment was court martialed and sentenced to death for refusing to obey the orders of a white officer while serving in the Korean War. Gilbert maintained that the orders would have meant certain death for himself and the men in his command. The case led to worldwide protests and increased attention to segregation and racism in the U.S. military. Gilbert's sentence was commuted to twenty and later seventeen years of imprisonment; he served five years and was released.\nThe integration commanded by Truman's 1948 Executive Order extended to schools and neighborhoods as well as military units. Fifteen years after the Executive Order, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara issued Department of Defense Directive 5120.36. \"Every military commander\", the Directive mandates, \"has the responsibility to oppose discriminatory practices affecting his men and their dependents and to foster equal opportunity for them, not only in areas under his immediate control, but also in nearby communities where they may gather in off-duty hours.\" While the directive was issued in 1963, it was not until 1967 that the first non-military establishment was declared off-limits. In 1970 the requirement that commanding officers first obtain permission from the Secretary of Defense was lifted, and areas were allowed to be declared housing areas off limits to military personnel by their commanding officer.\nSince the end of military segregation and the creation of an all-volunteer army, the American military saw the representation of African Americans in its ranks rise dramatically.\nKorean War.\nJesse L. Brown became the U.S. Navy's first black aviator in October 1948. He died when his plane was shot down during the Battle of Chosin Reservoir in North Korea. He was unable to parachute from his crippled F4U Corsair and crash-landed successfully. His injuries and damage to his aircraft prevented him from leaving the plane. A white squadron mate, Thomas Hudner, crash-landed his F4U Corsair near Brown and attempted to extricate Brown but could not and Brown died of his injuries. Hudner was awarded the Medal of Honor for his efforts. The U.S. Navy honored Jesse Brown by naming a frigate after him\u2014the USS \"Jesse L. Brown (FF-1089)\".\nJames H. Harvey (born July 13, 1923) became the U.S. Air Force's first African-American jet fighter pilot to engage in combat during the Korean War.\nTwo enlisted men from the 24th Infantry Regiment (still a segregated unit), Cornelius H. Charlton and William Thompson, posthumously received the Medal of Honor for actions during the war.\nU.S President Harry Truman issued the order to desegregate the armed forces on July 26, 1948. Truman believed that passing this order would help end racial discrimination. In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea and the United States entered to war. African American troops composed part of the task force.\nOn November 24, 1950, 300,000 Chinese troops stormed across the Yalu River, and the majority black 503rd Battalion found themselves directly in the line of fire. The ill-equipped unit lost the battle and many soldiers were killed or taken prisoner by the Chinese. The conditions in these prisons were cold with not enough food. The African American soldiers spent up to three years in the prisons. The Chinese captors believed that African Americans were particularly vulnerable to anti-American propaganda because of the discrimination they faced back home and in their units. As a result, the Chinese subjected African Americans to anti-capitalist and anti-imperial brainwashing more than their white counterparts.\nAbout 600,000 African Americans served in the armed forces during the war and 5,000 lost their life in combat. Many were awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, Silver Star, and Bronze Star.\nVietnam War.\nThe Vietnam War saw many great accomplishments by many African Americans, including twenty who received the Medal of Honor for their actions. African Americans were over-represented in hazardous duty and combat roles during the conflict, and suffered disproportionately higher casualty rates. Civil-rights leaders protested this disparity during the early years of the war, prompting reforms that were implemented in 1967\u201368 resulting in the casualty rate dropping to slightly higher than their percentage of the total population.\nIn 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented the Medal of Honor to U.S. Army Specialist Five Lawrence Joel, for a \"very special kind of courage\u2014the unarmed heroism of compassion and service to others.\" Joel was the first living African American to receive the Medal of Honor since the Mexican\u2013American War. He was a medic who in 1965 saved the lives of U.S. troops under ambush in Vietnam and defied direct orders to stay to the ground, walking through Viet Cong gunfire and tending to the troops despite being shot twice himself. The Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, is dedicated to his honor.\nOn August 21, 1968, with the posthumous award of the Medal of Honor, U.S. Marine James Anderson, Jr. became the first African-American U.S. Marine recipient of the Medal of Honor for his heroic actions and sacrifice of life.\nOn December 10, 1968, U.S. Army Captain Riley Leroy Pitts became the first African-American commissioned officer to be awarded the Medal of Honor. His medal was presented posthumously to his wife, Eula Pitts, by President Lyndon B. Johnson.\nThree out of the 21 African-American Medal of Honor recipients who served in Vietnam were members of the 5th Special Forces Group otherwise known as The Green Berets. These men are as follows: Sergeant First Class Melvin Morris, SFC. Eugene Ashley, Jr., and SFC. William Maud Bryant.\nMelvin Morris received the Medal of Honor 44 years after the action in which he earned the Distinguished Service Cross. Sergeant Ashley's medal was posthumously awarded to his family at the White House by Vice President Spiro T. Agnew on December 2, 1969.\nPost-Vietnam to present day.\nIn 1989, President George H. W. Bush appointed Army General Colin Powell to the position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, making Powell the highest-ranking officer in the United States military. Powell was the first, and is so far the only, African American to hold that position. The Chairman serves as the chief military adviser to the President and the Secretary of Defense. During his tenure Powell oversaw the 1989 United States invasion of Panama to oust General Manuel Noriega and the 1990 to 1991 Gulf War against Iraq. General Powell's four-year term as Chairman ended in 1993.\nGeneral William E. \"Kip\" Ward was officially nominated as the first commander of the new United States Africa Command on July 10, 2007, and assumed command on October 1, 2007.\nRonald L. Green, former Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps, is African-American.\nOn January 20, 2009, Barack Obama was inaugurated as President of the United States, making him \"ex officio\" the first African-American Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces.\nOn August 6, 2020, Charles Q. Brown Jr. became the first African-American chief of a United States military service branch, when he took over as Chief of Staff of the Air Force.\nOn January 22, 2021, Lloyd Austin became the first African-American Secretary of Defense.\nMilitary history of African Americans in popular culture.\nThe following is a list of notable African-American military members or units in popular culture."}
{"title": "To_Fly!", "label": "Film", "text": "To Fly! is a 1976 American short docufiction film by Greg MacGillivray and Jim Freeman of MacGillivray Freeman Films as the premiere film of the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) IMAX theater, opened for the museum's current building, celebrating the United States Bicentennial. It chronicles the history of aviation in the country and how the American imagination helped it revolutionize humanity, with a narration written by Thomas McGrath. The film explores themes of finding national identity and human's innate relationship with aviation.\nThe idea of the film dates back to 1970, and was revisited four years later following then-NASM director Michael Collins' interest in an IMAX theater. MacGillivray and Freeman expanded the story of \"To Fly!\" treatment given by the Smithsonian Institution and Francis Thompson, Inc. from a draft by the latter, by infusing humor to tell audiences that the film is not littered with technical jargon, as instructed by Collins. Due to IMAX's giant-screen nature, several filmmaking rules and techniques were implemented for immersion and clarity. The three cameras were rigorously modified to fit with MacGillivray and Freeman's intentions. Creation of the ending space sequence prompted experimentations due to the limits of the IMAX cameras and format. The film was edited by MacGillivray and Freeman themselves, while the score was composed by Bernardo Segall. Though over a year in the making and with a rough production, the film had a relatively low budget and was finished on schedule.\n\"To Fly!\" was released on July 1, 1976. Like other Bicentennial films, it was initially scheduled for only a year of screening, however as popularity surged, public outcry prompted everlasting screening. It was later released in non-IMAX formats and on home media. A 20th-anniversary special edition was later released in 1996. The film was deemed significant for introducing a vast audience to the then-new format, and its influence was acknowledged by IMAX filmmakers alike, making it inducted into the National Film Registry and the IMAX Hall of Fame. It also set MacGillivray as a major IMAX filmmaker. Amassing a large following and notable in its role to the growing popularity of museum IMAX theaters, it remained the highest-grossing giant-screen documentary for a long period and broke various other records. \"To Fly!\" received universal critical and audience acclaim particularly for its cinematography, editing, and narrative; hailed a Washingtonian icon; and received various accolades.\nSummary.\n\"To Fly!\" runs 27 minutes. It begins on July 4, 1831 in Craftsbury, Vermont, where fictional hot-air balloonist Ezekiel, after reciting his patriotic quatrain declaring himself a pioneer, ascends on a voyage around New England. Everyone below looks at the hot-air-balloon in awe and surprise at its magnificence. Ezekiel sees a canoeist heading for whitewater at Horseshoe Falls and yells \"Get to shore!\"; the canoeist immediately obliges before he could reach the rapid.\nThe film then chronicles the history of aviation, beginning with hot-air-balloons. It says that the newfound vertical angle of the world \"was like the opening of a new eye\", allowing humans to reach places previously untouched and extend the human limits, an act once considered \"godlike.\" The desire to fly also inspired the creation of skyscrapers. Although hot-air-balloons were revolutionary, the majority of Americans still used horses; thanks to the human imagination, the faster trains were invented, then the more accessible cars. Mechanical aircraft was later invented; unlike the balloon, there are more controls. The Roaring Twenties saw the invention of barnstorming, cited to further access to aviation among Americans. Military aviation was later invented, which formed flight demonstration squadrons like the Blue Angels. With airlines, flying became a travel medium, and access to the American territory expands westward beyond the mainland. After wide-body aircraft, ultralight aviation was invented.\n\"To Fly!\" ends with the launch of the Saturn IB in the Apollo\u2013Soyuz mission at the Kennedy Space Center on July 15, 1975. After dubbing spaceflight a historical feat, the narration existentially suggests that it can be used to discover extraterrestrial life, and uses it to depict the human imagination as limitless, which is credited to the philosophical awakening given by the vertical view of the world. Accompanied by a view of Earth, the film ends with the narration:We have come a long way from a time when people gazed enviously upon the birds in-flight. Today, we look upon our planet from afar, and feel a new tenderness for the tiny and fragile Earth. For we know now, that even as we walk upon the ground, we are ever in-flight through the universe. And so, we begin to realize that human destiny has ever been, and \"always must be\", to fly!\nProduction.\nDevelopment and writing.\nThe 1960s and 1970s were periods that saw increasing numbers of museum theaters as part of the effort to modernize museums with audiovisual content. The idea of a giant-screen theater at the National Air and Space Museum (NASM) itself dates back to 1970 in a 153-page report by the National Museum of Natural History (NMNH) curator team, which argues that the NASM needs a \"contemporary medium of communications\" that will resonate intellectually and psychologically. The report suggested a giant-screen experiential film that would showcase the American landscape and the country's introduction to technology, ending with predictions of the country's future with the availability of technology. The NMNH later proposed a panoramic curved IMAX screen at the NMNH's rotunda, but it was later discarded.\nIn 1974, when hearing that the Smithsonian Institution will open the new building of the NASM at the National Mall in Washington D.C. as part of the United States (US) Bicentennial, filmmaker and IMAX Corporation founder Graeme Ferguson proposed to then-director of the museum, astronaut Michael Collins, to open an IMAX theater as he believed it would be a big contribution to the museum. Collins had not seen an IMAX film and was not convinced at the time. However, when he went to Expo '74 to give a speech, an IMAX representative \"coaxed\" him to go to the event's own IMAX theater and see \"Man Belongs to the Earth\", a 23-minute environmentalist documentary film. Collins immediately expressed interest in building an IMAX theater, convinced that the experience would provide a sense of realism to visitors. This would make the NASM the first museum to have an IMAX theater. It was supported by then-deputy director Melvin B. Zisfein, who then made two film treatments, both of which were later discarded and replaced with a third one. The first treatment, \"The Beautiful Mysteries of Flight\", conceptualizes an aesthetic-centric film about the wonderous, mysterious nature of aviation, with hope that when audiences leave the theater and look at the exhibits, an amplified sense of wonder would be created. Despite being discarded, the two treatments had major influences on the third.\nOn July 1, giant-screen filmmaker Francis Thompson proposed to them a film about the history of flight for them to play as part of the Bicentennial, and as their theater's premiere film. With a US$750,000 budget from Conoco Inc., they set the project's deadline to 1976. Conoco helped fund the project \"as a Bicentennial gift\" to the NASM. It was owned by DuPont, who has significant work on aeronautics. After writing the third treatment with Francis Thompson, Inc. (credited as production and consultant company), the Smithsonian later commissioned filmmakers Greg MacGillivray and James \"Jim\" Freeman to make the film. The duo assumed the Smithsonian knew them from \"Jonathan Livingston Seagull\" (1973), which they co-filmed and received an Academy Award for Best Cinematography nomination; as well as from \"The Towering Inferno\" (1974), whose aerial shots were filmed by them and became a box-office success. They had known IMAX from reading monthly technology journals, and were \"delighted\" of the commission. Collins told MacGillivray and Freeman he did not want the film to be too history-oriented: \"I have plenty of historical plaques on the wall of my museum; please give me a film that entertains, and allows the audience to be amazed by flight.\" MacGillivray praised Collins for giving him full creative freedom.\nCollins and Zisfein also gave a list of suggestions, 20 of which were fulfilled. MacGillivray and Freeman deemed the given treatment not perfect enough, and expanded into \"a chronological story that contained humor, comical fictitious characters, and [...] a little bit of flight history.\" They also took some inspiration from their previous surf films, as well as their experience with aerial filmmaking. They analyzed 12 IMAX films for inspiration and reference, the first being \"Man Belongs to the Earth\", whose opening aerial shot of the Grand Canyon made them \"really pumped\". They observed how those 12 films vary in genre, from fiction, documentaries, to comedy, and wrote \"To Fly!\" so that it would be a mix of them, giving audiences a compact definition of IMAX. The opening scene is humorous so that audiences can relax and laugh, arguing that the purely factual nature of the NASM will come off as \"a dry, historical drama\" on film. Thompson agreed with this decision, saying that there are enough fact-based Bicentennial films, and that people need more entertainment. MacGillivray said that IMAX is perfect for the film as it \"allow[s] myself as a filmmaker to impact the audience in a greater way\"; he also called it a coincidence because the film depicts aviation when it was brand-new, and that IMAX was a brand-new product.\nWhile there is no extensive cast list, actress Ellen Bry played an unnamed role. Credited writers include Thompson, Robert M. Young and Arthur Zegart. Thomas McGrath wrote the narration. Researching was also done throughout pre-production; it overall took around seven months. Collins, physicist Jeffrey Kirsch, astronomer Paul Knappenberger, as well as aviators Walter J. Boyne and Donald S. Lopez Sr. helped with the process. Freeman's girlfriend Cindy Huston was the camera assistant; MacGillivray's then-girlfriend (now-wife) Barbara Smith was the production assistant, craft service specialist, still photographer and behind the scenes cinematographer; Bill Bennett and Jeff Blyth were the production managers; Brad Ohlund is the second assistant camera, and Phil Schwartz was the first. Other credits include Byron McKinney as executive producer; Elizabeth Howell as secretary and bookkeeper; Rae Troutman as grip; Brad Ohlund as assistant grip; and John Divers as storyboard developer. Television documentarian and historian Jon Wilkman was also \"briefly\" involved in pre-production. NASA, the Office of Naval Research, and California Institute of Technology were also involved in the production. According to MacGillivray, \"To Fly!\" is the best film he and Freeman worked on together for over 11 years.\nFilming.\nMacGillivray and Freeman directed and filmed \"To Fly!\", with them switching roles constantly. Principal photography occurred for a period of five months throughout 1975, with a pause in June to film the action sequences of \"Sky Riders\" (1976). They worked extensively: seven days a week and 14 hours a day from 5am to 9pm. Their filming budget, US$590,000, was relatively small, but did not disturb the production in any way. It also prompted a storyboard; using that and the script, he and Freeman made various ways (self-coined \"IMAX moments\") to thrill the IMAX audiences and to rely on visuals more instead of narration. Each scene was planned to fit with the IMAX format. A version of the storyboard was colored to avoid miscommunications among clients post-filming. As firm believers of filmmaking as a collaboration, MacGillivray and Freeman were also open with the crew, allowing creative suggestions from them.\nAt the time, there was only one line of IMAX cameras which are heavy, weighing , and have low specifications, dismaying the filmmakers, who wanted \"To Fly!\" to be an IMAX game-changer. Additionally, they were worried of damaging that one and only camera model they were able to get, and also wanted to minimize the need for retaking should it be needed. Ferguson and fellow IMAX co-founders Bill Shaw, and Robert Kerr were proposed to produce three new cameras with detailed higher specifications. MacGillivray also said that the cameras will also be used for \"American Years\", a 50-minute epic IMAX film for the temporary Philadelphia '76 theater, also a Bicentennial celebration. Ferguson granted the proposal with glee. However while filming \"To Fly!\", there was a scene using the second camera that required filming from a parachute, but the parachute did not deploy and the camera was destroyed.\nBecause of the nature of IMAX, a new set of filming rules were abided, and many conventional rules ignored. It took three months to test the cameras and other equipment to ensure production will run flawlessly. To make the film bright, colorful, and naturalistic, they used the 65mm film stock Eastman Color Negative 5254, and merely used a standard Tiffen 85 filter. The short duration was cited to the high cost of the film stock. To have a dramatic look, they used cross and cross-back lighting. The then-new O'Connor 150 tripod head was used due to its ability to withstand the heavy cameras. Because the IMAX screen is enormous, the audiences sits relatively close to the screen, and \"the new center lies approximately one-third up from the bottom of the screen.\" Thus, extreme-long shots were treated as wide-angle shots, while the latter was treated as normal shots. Condensed movement was used to switch between an extreme long shot to medium close-up, and a wide-angle lens was used to further expand the film's view. According to MacGillivray, \"Plenty of headroom is needed in all closeups (in IMAX, the medium closeup) so the audience can establish comfortable eye-contact.\" Camera lenses were also carefully picked. A scene with a vertical view of New York City used a 30mm fisheye lens, giving it edge curvature and image distortion. For lenses specifically built for Hasselblad cameras, shutters were removed and the mounts were modified in order to fit in the IMAX cameras, and the focal lengths were changed from 30mm to 60mm. Amid filming, the film crew wished they had a zoom lens that could have eased some of the filming; they used the first IMAX zoom lens in their later film, \"Behold Hawaii\" (1983).\nMany shots in the film took a long time to prepare: for example, a 35-second shot of the Blue Angels speeding over the Colorado River and Yuma Desert took over four months to choreograph. MacGillivray described it as time-consuming. Camera mounts were designed by the United States Navy (USN) for a McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II used to film the scene. Despite lack of confidence that it will work successfully, fellow friend Nelson Tyler managed to spend two months developing two mounts for the camera helicopters, one to film forward-moving shots and another equipped with a camera dolly to film from the side, that allow smooth aerial shots. Remote-controlled devices were also built to move the second mount. The helicopters were piloted by George Nolan, Chuck Phillips, and Adrian Brooks. Mounts were also by Boeing for the Boeing 747, as well as on Art Scholl's \"Super Chipmunk\" aircraft, which was used to film front point-of-views. The mounts took weeks to test so that the camera can stay intact without even a bit of vibration. The hot-air-balloon aerial scenes were filmed from a helicopter. Real-life expert balloonist Peter Walker was chosen to play the role of Ezekiel. Because during the colonial times hot-air-balloons were powered by helium, the USN donated free helium for the film crew as a gift because of the Blue Angels' presence in the film.\nAerial work platforms were used to support the balloon basket, as well as the camera; the former was supported by two platforms as it \"moved in opposing directions to heighten the illusion of actual in-flight motion.\" To create a scene where a 1891 Sierra No. 3 locomotive hits the screen, the film crew placed a mirror at the end of the track, then point the wide-angle camera sideways to point to the mirror for a symmetrical view of the rail as the locomotive approaches and shatters the mirror. For shots featuring close-ups of the pilots \"flying\" the air vehicles, the illusion was made by filming with the sky in the background while the aircraft's engines rev and the camera moves in and out of a \"rough\" dolly. Bob Wills also flew the Kauai coastline hang-glider, one of the scenes suggested by Collins and Zisfein during a period where the sport saw spiking popularity. A stagecoach was used in a scene where it races with the locomotive. Prior to that scene, a Conestoga wagon is depicted. The 747 aerial scene was filmed from a 737 donated by Boeing. A Curtiss Model D was flown by Frank Tallman for the mechanical flight sequence. A Ford Flivver was used in a segue between the car and mechanical flight scene; this was done by a low shot accelerating with audiences assuming this is the car, but to their surprise it flies beyond the ground above Coastal California. Other filming locations include the Gateway Arch, Lake Powell, Monument Valley, and Yosemite Falls. The barnstorming scene was filmed in California. There was a deleted scene in the opening sequence where the crowd witnessing Ezekiel's ascent perform barn raising.\nFilming ended on schedule, despite all the technical challenges faced; MacGillivray largely credited this to the extensive preparation done pre-production.\nSpace sequence.\nThe space sequence begins with the launch of the Saturn IB rocket. They were given \"special permission\" to film it, marking the first time a rocket launch was filmed on IMAX. The film crew took this part of the production more seriously, as it cannot be repeated, unlike the other parts of production, despite their equal level of difficulty. As they left the camera outside for a day, humidity causes the camera to become condensed; this was exacerbated by seasonal thunderstorms. Despite their best efforts, the camera was later found wet and jammed, and they immediately cleaned and lubricated it for around three hours. They managed to catch the launch on film despite initial uncertainty.\nWith such a low budget, the film crew initially conceived the space sequence as merely a compilation of astronomical images, but realized they needed some kind of movement for a giant-screen film, and thus saved money on the live-action filming so that a better space sequence can be created. They expected \"To Fly!\" to be compared with the Cinerama classic \"\" (1968) and, despite their limited resources, try to make the space sequence as reminiscent of the film as possible. When reading about the film's production, they learned that something small like stars on an IMAX presentation is nothing on a traditional presentation; after some difficulty, they managed to create the stars on a Kodalith negative sheet film. Another thing they learned from \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" was that movement is important. The IMAX nature meant that they could only film the space sequence at six and 12 frames per second and that stop motion technique is impossible; additional limitations prompted detailed communication with the NASM to help assist the production. George Casey and Lester Novros of Graphic Films provided planetary models and studio facilities for scenes that require them, as well as using their expertise to ease the production.\nIn a scene where the spaceship passes Jupiter and Io, they filmed separate elements in separate film rolls; each \"required four separate passes of the negative through the camera, each time being rewound to heads and rethreaded to a common start frame.\" The camera was placed on a motorized dolly. They filmed Io first, then Jupiter, then the spaceship. According to Blyth, \"The [space]ship was a transparency of a starship model rear-lighted on a stationary glass frame\"; MacGillivray and Freeman constructed it, and Blyth designed it to have the same color palette as the 747. The starship's components were based on then-future ideas about propulsion systems like advanced ion thrusters, as well as Magnetically confined fusions like deuterium-3 and helium-3. Overall models took 150 hours to create. The scene featuring the dark Earth and a horizon sunrise used a dolly. Some scenes, including a Saturn scene, was filmed at a homemade animation stand; others used a pseudo version of the slit-scan photography kit used for \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". A modified auxiliary peg bar was used to attach the models; the glass sheet with the starship was suspended nearby the bar. Several motors and control devices were tried to film the extremely slow scenes, and the zoom motors were determined to work the best. To add movement to the shots, a geared head and a custom gear operated by the zoom motor were used, creating a \"slight\" pan. They filmed all these scenes on 16mm first, to make sure they were replicable on IMAX. Collins assisted this entire segment of production to ensure realism.\nThe penultimate set of shots of nebulae used bellows and Hasselblad close-up lens, the camera facing a water-filled tray; the nebulae were a mixture of jet black ink and white enamel paint, with color coming from the gelled lighting. The materials' temperature, thickness, size, and type had to be precise and same to achieve the reaction. Since they had to film at 96 fps, two solutions were most implemented to slow down the movement: pouring mineral oil and applying paint thinner to the tray; the latter was favored as it created more interesting movements akin to three-dimensional effect. Often a small wire was shaped and dipped into the tray to create specific patterns. Special effects designers Jim Palmer and Barney Kaelin created the laser beam effects; they had experimented with various types of patterns pre-production.\nOverall, the space sequence took 4\u00bd months to prepare, test, and film.\nPost-production.\n\"To Fly!\" was edited by MacGillivray and Freeman himself, with Alexander Hammid supervising, on a Moviola. Knowing that they would experiment on different editing styles, the film's shots were directed beforehand so that it would allow them to do so. Pacing is normal, so that audiences have enough time to explore the entirety of the shots. In the opening, the part where Ezekiel is still at land merely uses 1\u20446th of the IMAX surface; as he ascends, all of the screen is utilized; this is to give a dramatic sense to the film, as well as a reference to aviation, which the film calls \"like the opening of a new eye.\" That idea, whose goal was to give audiences a good impression of IMAX, was taken from the similarly styled opening sequence of \"This is Cinerama\" (1952). Multi-screen images\u2014the act of placing duplicates of images in the same screen\u2014 were occasionally done, inspired by the multi-projector film \"Labyrinth\" (1967) and the first IMAX film \"Tiger Child\" (1970). There is a Blue Angels scene where the screen proportionally divides into 36 all featuring the same shot. After learning that an inconsiderately-placed multi-screen scene would create a confusing experience for audiences, Jim Liles of the Optical Department at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and filmmaker Dennis Earl Moore designed new mattes where the bottom row is 15% larger than the top, allowing for clearer focus of attention. Smith supervised research for the stock footage to be incorporated into the multi-screen scenes, and handpicked footages shot by MacGillivray himself. After editing, a Cinemeccanica Norelco AAII 35mm-70mm projector was installed at their studio and sat relatively close to the screen to get a feel of what \"To Fly!\" would look like on IMAX. Overall, editing took four months.\nMacGillivray considers \"To Fly!\" \"an audiovisual voyage through time\", and thus wanted the best person to compose the film score. Eventually it was composed and conducted by Bernardo Segall and performed by \"the most professional and experienced symphonic\" 49-piece orchestra in California at The Burbank Studios. Segall was chosen because he was considered a great classical composer whose works have \"an air of sophistication and elegance, which would maintain the steady rhythm and pulse of the film.\" The score was the first in history to use a keyed bugle, which is also depicted in the film's opening sequence: during the gathering for Ezekiel's ascent, a small fanfare team plays a fife, drum, clarinet, and B\u266d keyed bugle. The score was later edited by Richard R. McCurdy and mixed by Dan Wallin; the latter was assisted by Paul Martin. The score was recorded on a 16-track recorder, which was then mixed down to three out of the six channels at the 35mm full-coat sprocketed magnetic film. It was mixed \"authentically\" to create a quadrophonic surround experience. Todd-AO's Los Angeles mixing facility in Hollywood was also used for post-production; Joseph Ellison, later the creator of \"Don't Go in the House\" (1980), participated in this segment. For the sound effects, Sam Shaw was the editor, while Ray West and Jack Woltz were mixers. Because of IMAX's high audio technology, certain scenes in the film were made just for the audio experience. For example, a multi-screen scene where two jets cross each other, which exploits the surround nature of the sound system; MacGillivray expected audience to \"shiver\" in this scene, due to the dramatic shift of attention. Another example is in a scene where the locomotive hits the screen; the engine noises went from the center to all around the audience.\nClients applauded the rough cut; two of the biggest, the Smithsonian and Conoco, gave various inputs for the final cut. Conoco later became the film's sponsor. The whole post-production process, combined with the space sequence production, took a total of six months.\nThemes and style.\n\"To Fly!\" contains themes of how the imaginations of the American people helped pioneer aviation, and how the aerial sceneries further inspired them to improve aviation and revolutionized the world. This is proven by the many aircraft shots backdropped with the country's landscapes. Critic Daniel Eagan opined that the majority of the point of views depicted in the film's opening sequence are \"stately, processional, celebrating the American landscape while remaining distant from it.\" From there, the film explores the country, \"igniting patriotic empathy.\" It was also viewed as a nationalist film, linking the American quest for national identity to the development of aviation through metanarratives, as well as the linear, westward progress of aviation, though its visual rhetoric only shines in the space sequence. The Smithsonian, in reference to the final narration of the film, said that its theme is: \"Flight, in all its forms, is part of the Human condition, part of our Destiny.\"\nCollins said that the film's style makes it \"a break from the learning going on in the rest of the museum\", and NASM former assistant LeRoy London, alongside then-Chief of Presentations and Education Von Del Chamberlain, said it is an amplification of the fascination or interest of flying within visitors after seeing all the exhibits in the museum. Film author Alison Griffiths argued that the film is an add-on to a museum admission: where the exhibits give visitors information and interest, the film gives them a specific sense of wonder exhibits may fail to provide. Steve McKerrow of \"The Baltimore Sun\" noted how certain scenes are tributes to cinematic history: the shot where the train hits the camera is similar to one from \"The Great Train Robbery\" (1903); the hot-air-balloon scenes are reminiscent of \"Around the World in 80 Days\" (1956); and the barnstorming scene is probably set in the same field in \"North by Northwest\" (1959), in a crop duster chase scene. The film has been categorized a travelogue of the US, which is compared to the closing section of \"This is Cinerama\", which has a similar narrative.\nRelease.\nPress announcements of \"To Fly!\" date back to May 16, 1976, and earlier on June 24, there was a preview of the film at the NASM's Samuel P. Langley IMAX Theater (renamed Lockheed Martin in 2002). It was later released at Langley Theater on July 1, 1976 \"to packed audiences.\" It was labeled a public service by Conoco, who was also distributor. Lawrence Associates was co-distributor. MacGillivray assisted the then-inexperienced projectionists, and frequently visited the projection booth to ensure the film roll is in good condition. Pachelbel's Canon in D was the music that played as audiences enter the theater, a decision praised as memorable, relaxing, religiously experiential, and meaningful. The music has been interpreted as about human's quest to fly, aligning with the very film it is accompanied by. All earnings of the film accrued to theater maintenance and financing future IMAX productions. After September 6 (Labor Day), Conoco began distributing the film to schools, organizations, and non-IMAX theaters. Like other Bicentennial films, \"To Fly!\" was scheduled for a one-year run, but the revelation of this was met with public outcry, and the NASM decided to keep the film. In the 1990s, they decided to upgrade the sound system to digital, \"rejuvenating\" the film's glory, and also release the film in digital projection. At times, there were about 14 showtimes every day.\nHowever, Freeman (aged 32) was killed in a helicopter crash at the Sierra Nevada two days prior to release, while finding locations for a Kodak commercial. Grief-stricken, MacGillivray doubted he could ever continue filmmaking as he and Freeman were very close friends, but he coped with it, keeping the production company's name, MacGillivray Freeman Films (MFF), as a tribute. The tragedy also makes \"To Fly!\" Freeman's swan song. A 20th-anniversary special edition was screened in 1996, which used a new version of score. An example of the alteration is in the theme music, where a masculine chant of the melody was added, and a shot of a vast forest, whose score has a feminine sigh as the expanse is revealed. To mark the film's 35th anniversary, it was screened at 50 cents for adults and 25 cents for children, the same price used until the 1980s; this often switched with US$1 for adults and 50 cents for children. Airbus IMAX Theater of the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center, screens it since its opening.\n\"To Fly!\" started a trend beginning in 1980, with IMAX theaters constructed in the US, Canada, and 22 other countries. Prior to this, there were only five in the US. The Smithsonian later also built an IMAX theater, named after Samuel C. Johnson, at the NMNH. Museums \"went crazy\" over the film, specifically the transformative opening sequence. Michael Kernan of \"The Washington Post\" credited word of mouth to the popularity, as marketing was limited to brochures and newspaper ads, as well as TV spots by theaters. MacGillivray did not expect such milestone, and credited Freeman's talent to the success. Screening film formats include (but not limited to) 16mm, 15 perforations/70mm, 8/70mm, Omninax-customized 15/70mm, and IMAX 4K Laser. For the first 15 months of the National Museum of Photography, Film &amp; Television IMAX theater in April 1983, \"To Fly!\" was the only film; the museum stated that its \"breathtaking\" and \"beautiful\" visuals reflect their mission to showcase giant-screen films. It was rescreened in 2013 for their 30th anniversary. At the NASM and American Museum of Natural History's Naturemax Theater, also part of the Smithsonian, the film preceded the world travelogue \"Living Planet\" (1979) in a double feature. The NASM later replaced \"Living Planet\" with MFF's \"Speed\" (1984), a decision given a B- grade by \"The Fresno Bee\". \"To Fly!\", translated to French, was also part of another double feature with \"Blue Planet\" (1990) at the Montreal Science Centre IMAX theater, in order to \"relive the greatest moments of man's conquest to the skies.\" The film was the premiere film for three theme park IMAX-es: Six Flags Great America's Pictorium IMAX Theater (1979), the Dreamworld IMAX Theater at Gold Coast, Australia (1981), and the Speelland Beekse Bergen's IMAX theater at Hilvarenbeek, the Netherlands (June 19, 1981). Dreamworld's founder John Longhurst was inspired to make the IMAX theater after seeing the \"exciting\" \"To Fly!\". Other countries include Germany, Japan, Mexico, and Indonesia (Keong Emas IMAX Theater, Jakarta). The film has been translated to 10 languages as of 2012. As of that year, nearly 150 theaters had screened it, with MFF reporting more than 200 in 2021. It has also been screened in various film festivals, including the 2019 IMAX Victoria Film Festival, combined with \"North of Superior\" (1971), the second IMAX film, in a double feature dubbed \"The Dawn of IMAX Filmmaking\".\n\"To Fly!\" saw a Betamax and VHS release in 1985, and an NTSC LaserDisc release on December 12, 1991, manufactured by Pioneer USA and released by Lumivision. On March 20, 2011, the VHS release was preserved at the Hagley Museum and Library, thus available for free at the Hagley Digital Archives. The VHS release is distinct in that the originally squared opening sequence was edited to fill up the entire screen, and that a large portion of the drum rolling in the beginning of the film is cut. The LaserDisc release has the film divided into 12 chapters, and presented in a aspect ratio, contrary to the native 1.43:1 IMAX-custom aspect ratio. It also changes the title color to light gray. The film was later available on Amazon Prime Video. On October 7, 2021, MFF launched a streaming service, Movies For Families, and included \"To Fly!\" anniversary edition, presented in the widescreen aspect ratio.\nReception.\nBox office.\nAn estimated number of a million people have seen \"To Fly!\" at Langley Theater in its first year, with approximately 80% of seats occupied (the theater has 485 seats). The \"Elyria Chronicle Telegram\", however, claimed the numbers to be 8 million. As of 1980, Langley Theater amassed more than 6.3 million viewers, with an average 77% of seats filled. More than 100 million people have probably seen it in theaters, with over 15 million at the NASM; 4.5 million of which are in the first four years, and reaching 13 million in 1996. On the day of its 20th anniversary, a \"CBS This Morning\" report dubbed it \"the longest running ticketed film in one location in history.\" As of 1996, the film accumulated over 300 million viewers worldwide. Initially, Collins had only projected 3\u00bd of NASM visitors to see the film during its initial one-year run. The \"Lodi News-Sentinel\" reported in 1991 that over 100 million people have viewed it at schools and television.\nThe film's earnings spiked from US$20 million in 1993 to US$100 million in 1999. It was the third highest-grossing IMAX documentary as of 2002, earning US$113 million, behind \"The Dream is Alive\" (1985, US$150 million) and MFF's \"Everest\" (1998, US$114 million). \"To Fly!\" also set several box-office records. \"The Numbers\" reported in an unknown date that it grossed over US$86.6 million within the US and Canada, as well as US$34.1 million outside, for a worldwide total of US$120.7 million. However a 2003 Duke University Press publication reported it grossed more than US$150 million worldwide. On the other hand, MFF reported US$135 million as of April 2015. It was the highest grossing documentary of all time before \"Fahrenheit 9/11\" (2004), though remains the second-highest grossing giant-screen documentary film, after \"Everest\". The film is the longest-exhibited documentary in the world, the longest-running sponsored Washington, D.C. film, as well as the highest grossing sponsored film of all time. However, the film has seldom been screened in non-IMAX theaters, making it unpopular among filmgoers. According to \"The Numbers\", it is (within the US and Canada) the second highest-grossing 1976 film, behind \"Rocky\", which grossed US$117,235,147, and above \"A Star is Born\", which grossed US$63,129,898.\nReviews.\n\"To Fly!\" was raved by many film critics. John Alderson of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" summarized his and other critics' reviews with: \"The subject [of \"To Fly!\"] charms its imagination, while the IMAX format goes right to the brink of [audiovisual] sensory overload.\" \"The Washington Post\" hailed it a Washingtonian icon and a must-watch to all Washingtonians. The film was cited as an example of the role of screen size in amplifying the cinematic thrills, the power of aerial photography, and IMAX as a form of cinematic travel, as well as a pioneer of cinematic kinesthetic responses and coverage of science and technology. Multiple reviewers dubbed the film one of the best IMAX films, with David Handler of the Newspaper Enterprise Association agreeing with audiences for dubbing it \"the ultimate film trip\". It was also listed among the best films of the 1970s and the best documentaries. \"BioScience\" and the Michelin Green Guide called it a must for NASM visitors. Contemporarily, it was hailed the most underrated, electric cinematic spectacle.\nThe cinematography received universal acclaim for its thrills; which has been compared to amusement park rides. Its immersive nature, which provides the viewers with vicarious participation, is said to trigger them with an appreciation of the exhibits inside the NASM. Donna Whitehead of \"Norwalk News\" praised the usage of IMAX to the best advantage, with soaring shots galore; its illusion of reality is amplified by the score. Tom Chernitsky of the \"Elyria Chronicle Telegram\" agreed with the latter point and also credited the \"unusual\" camera angles and novel techniques to the film's mastery. It also received positive reviews from teachers, who observed that the immersive cinematography alone makes it educational, as it teaches children what it feels to fly. However, this has also led to polarization, as it \"makes you wish you were wearing a seat belt.\" The squared segment of the opening sequence was praised for disappointing audiences that it does not fill the entire IMAX screen, before eventually expanding. John Russell of \"The New York Times\" credited the cinematography to the audiences' immersion upon the narrative despite its short duration, with the plot getting better as the film progresses. He and John Gelmis of \"Newsday\" called it a poetry film, citing its lyrical, wonderous look of nature. Dan Moran of the \"Lake County News-Sun\" said that the film is one of the few Pictorium films not like the rest which were meant to make visitors asleep after a long day playing. Nathan Southern of AllMovie gave the film 4\u00bd out of 5 stars, stating that its aerial shots helped it be the vivid insight to American transportation as it should, calling the film historically significant and \"One of the greatest unsung landmarks of American documentary\". Jim Clash of \"Forbes\" categorized it an epic film, citing its \"vertiginous\" cinematography. The space sequence's goal of resembling \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" is said to succeed. Major film companies were urged to \"watch out\", predicting that \"To Fly!\" will set IMAX as a leading cinematic format.\nThe film, especially the story, was more well-reviewed contemporarily. Carl Sagan wrote in his book \"The Demon-Haunted World\" (1995) that he had watched the film at the NASM more than five times, and it still astonished him. \"The Tampa Tribune\" rated the film 3 out of 4 stars, calling it a \"fun parade\" of aviation history and a \"treat\", saying the Horseshoe Falls and barnstorming scenes are the best. Its poetic mood makes it described as a paean. Whitehead called the opening scene intimate yet magical, and the ending uplifting. Russell praised the narration and narrator as personal and meditative. The film's combination of vintage and contemporary settings is said to add to the emotional and nostalgic weight. Filmmaker Mark R. Hasan of KQEK.com criticized some of the film's \"rough\" editing, and that Ezekiel's dialogues are \"quite awful\", exacerbated by \"rudimentary\" sound mixing, though disclaimed that all these shortcomings fade after the opening, with sweeping cinematography, thematically ambient score, as well as \"elaborate\" and \"directional\" sound mixing during the spaceflight scene. Stuart Heritage of \"The Guardian\" puts the film in the \"dreary, educational\" category of IMAX documentaries. Jeremy Smith of \"Yardbarker\" praised the film's effective motivation, but opined its use of IMAX as a gimmick, albeit a good one. Eagan disagrees, saying that the film's shots are still breathtaking even in smaller formats. Documentarian Ross Anthony of \"Hollywood Report Card\" gave the film a B+ grade, equivalent to 2.5 out of 4 stars, noting that he would've graded it A had he wrote his review contemporarily. He opined that Ezekiel is a banal caricature, and that the hot-air balloon scenes were edited inconsistently, also observing that it does not move at all. He also lamented the omissions of real-life aviation pioneers. He concluded that \"To Fly!\" is \"amusing and informative (on a basic level)\", and recommended the short IMAX experimental film \"Silent Sky\" (1977) for aviation enthusiasts.\nAudience response.\nAudiences, regardless of demographics, were \"astonished\" by \"To Fly!\" IMAX vertiginous shots. Sighs, gasps, \"ooh\"-s, and cries were heard in most of the audiences. During the balloon opening sequence, \"ahhh\"-s can be heard; and during the Blue Angels and hang-gliding scene, some audiences can be heard screaming. Others, however, screamed in jolt and \"hastily\" left the theater during its vertiginous scenes, with the uncontrollable dizziness lingering long after the film finishes for some. Sickness bags were also unavailable. Later, the NASM added pre-entry warnings about potential dizziness and motion sickness. The audience reactions also prompted them to blurb the film on their website with: \"\"Feel\" the Earth Drop Away Beneath You\". In 2016, \"\"Feel\" was changed to \"Watch\"\" as part of a longer synopsis; a 40th-anniversary one-minute trailer was also released. Expert hang-gliders were surprised at the hang-gliding stunt: \"[42] years later, Bob Wills and \"To Fly!\" can blow even these guys away.\" Wills later died in 1977 while hang-gliding for a Jeep commercial. People with fear of flying said that they are able to watch it without getting scared. Those who watched it also brought their children there to watch the film, akin to a generational tradition. Audiences also found the film to be memorable. The 2011 Virginia earthquake coincided with the Horseshoe Falls scene as \"To Fly!\" played at Lockheed Martin, and audiences did not think it was an earthquake assuming the shaking came from the subwoofers. Responding to the popularity, Bill McCabe of DuPont Aerospace Enterprise argued that, because humans have an innate interest in flying, the film has a specific appeal to everyone. Meanwhile, MacGillivray said that the film's \"unpretentiousness and lightheartedness\" makes it a form of escapism, and that its unconventional ending makes it stand out, \"more profound and in a way, more lasting.\"\nAccolades.\nAs of October 8, 1992, \"To Fly!\" received 11 awards. The following table only lists the accolades as listed at the MFF website.\nLegacy.\n\"To Fly!\" was hailed by many as a contemporary and classic blockbuster. The film was listed in 2020 by Wilkman, writing for \"Literary Hub\", as one of the 21 Documentaries That Redefined the Genre. It was also listed as the top three reason people visit Washington, D.C. The film also has a significant history with political figures, viewed by government officials of the Soviet Union, Spain, United Kingdom, Egypt, Indonesia, US, and Greece. During his first inauguration (1981), US President Ronald Reagan handed a copy to Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev; Reagan later attended the film's Soviet premiere at Moscow. When George H. W. Bush met Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on April 6, 1989, they went to the NASM and saw it. \nContrary to popular belief, the film is not the first in IMAX, though was instrumental to introducing a more vast audience of the then-new format. IMAX filmmaker Kieth Merrill credited \"To Fly!\" to the success of IMAX. Ron Fricke shot the art film \"Chronos\" (1985) in IMAX after seeing \"To Fly!\", regretting not filming his more popular film \"Koyaanisqatsi\" (1982) in IMAX; MacGillivray was the latter's Second Unit Aerial Photographer. Brian J. Terwilliger of the IMAX documentary \"Living in the Age of Airplanes\" (2015) chose to theatrically premiere it at Lockheed Martin as a tribute to \"To Fly!\" which he watched when he was in eighth grade. Christopher Nolan was inspired to make visually immersive films, after watching \"To Fly!\" at the age of 14 and noticing how the audience tilts their head during the flying sequences; MacGillivray consulted him on the IMAX cameras for \"The Dark Knight Rises\" (2012), whose aerial scenes were inspired by \"To Fly!\". Astronaut Terry W. Virts, who starred in the IMAX documentary \"A Beautiful Planet\" (2016), called \"To Fly!\" one of his most memorable childhood IMAX films. It was also cited as a great influence on the legitimation of IMAX and the usage of multi-screen scenes in IMAX films, which have been common practice ever since. In 1995, the film was deemed a pioneer of the IMAX format by the Library of Congress, thus \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" to be preserved by the National Film Registry (NFR). Voters at the Giant Screen Cinema Association inducted it into the IMAX Hall of Fame on September 24, 2001, a decision praised by then-co-chief executive officers Richard Gelfond and Bradley J. Wechsler, stating the film deserves such recognition. It was also preserved at the National Archives and Records Administration and the Smithsonian Institution Archives.\nUpon popularity, in 1980, the NASM requested that Conoco collaborate with MacGillivray and Moore in another short IMAX film, \"Flyers\" (1982), a coming-of-age drama film about a teenager who aspires to be a pilot. The film is the second MacGillivray IMAX film. \"Flyers\" also became an instant success, though at a less rate than \"To Fly!\", and on March 4, 1982, Random House made an eponymous companion picture children's book. At Rotterdam in 1990, it played succeeding \"To Fly!\" as part of a double feature. MFF continued making IMAX documentaries, notably \"The Living Sea\" (1995), which was inducted into the IMAX Hall of Fame and nominated for Best Short Documentary at the 68th Academy Awards; and \"Dolphins\" (2000) which was highest-grossing documentary of that year and was also nominated for Best Short Documentary at the 73rd Academy Awards. Still active, the production was credited to the success of IMAX and one of the most influential and notable IMAX figures with over US$1 billion at the box office; Lea Silver of IMAX Victoria called him \"a big deal\". In 1984, a film using outtakes from \"To Fly!\" and \"Flyers\" was proposed, but this never happened. Instead, MacGillivray released \"The Magic of Flight\" (1996), a \"sequel\" inspired by \"To Fly!\" Blue Angels sequence."}
{"title": "Man_of_Steel_(film)", "label": "Film", "text": "Man of Steel is a 2013 superhero film based on the DC Comics character Superman. Co-produced by Warner Bros. Pictures and Syncopy in association with Legendary Pictures, and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures, it is the first installment in the DC Extended Universe (DCEU) and a reboot of the \"Superman\" film series that portrays the character's origin story. The film is directed by Zack Snyder, written by David S. Goyer from a story by him and Christopher Nolan, who also produces, and stars Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Michael Shannon, Kevin Costner, Diane Lane, Laurence Fishburne, Antje Traue, Ayelet Zurer, Christopher Meloni and Russell Crowe. In the film, Clark Kent learns that he is a superpowered alien from the planet Krypton. He assumes the role of mankind's protector as Superman, making the choice to face General Zod and prevent him from destroying humanity.\nDevelopment began in 2008 when Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters, and directors, opting to reboot the franchise. In 2009, a court ruling resulted in Jerry Siegel's family recapturing the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's copyright. The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films, but if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film. Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer's idea after story discussion on \"The Dark Knight Rises\", and Snyder was hired as the film's director in October 2010. Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago, Illinois, before moving to Vancouver and Plano, Illinois.\n\"Man of Steel\" was released in theaters on June 14, 2013, in 2D, 3D, and IMAX. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the film's action sequences and visuals but criticizing its pacing, dark tone, and perceived lack of character development. Hans Zimmer's score and Cavill's performance as Superman were also met with a polarized response. The film grossed over $668million worldwide, it made a net profit of approximately $42 million, and is the ninth-highest-grossing film of 2013. It is the final DC film produced by Legendary Pictures. A follow-up entitled \"\" was released on March 25, 2016.\nPlot.\nThe planet Krypton is destabilized from the mining of the planetary core. Just before the planet explodes, Krypton's supreme council chief advisor Jor-El infuses the genetics codex into his infant son, Kal-El, the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Jor-El manages to send Kal-El in a spacecraft toward Earth before being killed by General Zod during an uprising. Kal-El lands in Kansas, where he is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent and named Clark. As he grows older, he develops superhuman powers that Jonathan urges him to keep hidden, even refusing Clark's help years later during a tornado incident where he loses his life. Burdened with guilt over Jonathan's death, Clark travels the globe hiding under various aliases seeking a purpose in life.\n\"Daily Planet\" reporter Lois Lane receives an assignment to investigate the discovery of a Kryptonian scout ship in the Canadian Arctic. Clark enters the ship disguised as a worker and learns from its artificial intelligence (AI), modeled after his father Jor-El, that Clark was sent to Earth to guide its people. While following Clark, Lois inadvertently triggers the ship's security system, and he uses his powers to rescue Lois from its defenses. He wears a uniform provided by the ship's AI and begins testing his flying abilities. Unable to convince supervisor Perry White to publish an article on the incident, Lois tracks down Clark in Smallville, with the intent of exposing him. However, Lois drops the story upon hearing of Jonathan Kent's sacrifice, keeping Clark's identity safe but fueling Perry's suspicions.\nZod and his crew escape the Phantom Zone, where they were imprisoned for treason for their actions against Krypton. They travel to Earth to turn it into a new Krypton, possessing several terraforming devices salvaged from Kryptonian outposts. Following Clark and Lois' capture, Zod's science officer, Jax-Ur, extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will build a society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity. Using the Jor-El AI to take over the ship, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military of Zod's plan, resulting in an explosive confrontation between Clark and Zod's troops.\nZod deploys his most powerful terraforming device, the World Engine, which severely damages Metropolis and puts humanity's existence at risk. Given the codename \"Superman\", Clark destroys the terraforming platform while the military launches a suicide attack, sending Zod's troops back to the Phantom Zone. With the ship destroyed and Krypton's only hope of revival gone, Zod vows to destroy Earth and its inhabitants out of revenge. The two Kryptonians engage in a lengthy battle across Metropolis, which concludes when Clark is forced to kill Zod as he attacks a family in a train station. Clark adopts the moniker \"Superman\" and persuades the government to let him act independently, under the condition he does not turn against humanity. To gain covert access to dangerous situations, he takes a job under his civilian identity, Clark, as a freelance reporter for the \"Daily Planet\".\nA Kryptonian sent by his parents to Earth as an infant to escape the destruction of his homeworld, Krypton, and raised under the mental guidance of farmers in Smallville, Kansas, until he is inspired by the holographic message from his late father to become Earth's greatest protector. Cavill is the first non-American actor to play the character. He was previously cast in \"\", which was ultimately shelved, and was considered for the role in the 2006 film \"Superman Returns\", but lost to Brandon Routh. Cavill stated, \"There's a very real story behind the Superman character.\" He explained that everyone's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities\u2014including his birth name, Kal-El, and his alter ego, Clark Kent. Cavill also stated that, \"He's alone and there's no one like him,\" referring to Superman's vulnerabilities. \"That must be incredibly scary and lonely, not to know who you are or what you are, and trying to find out what makes sense. Where's your baseline? What do you draw from? Where do you draw a limit with the power you have? In itself, that's an incredible weakness.\" In an interview with \"Total Film\" magazine, Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5,000 calories a day, training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass. Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9-year-old Clark Kent, and Dylan Sprayberry was cast as the 13-year-old Clark Kent.\nA reporter for the \"Daily Planet\" newspaper and the love interest of Clark Kent. Adams was selected from a list of actresses that included Kristen Stewart, Zoe Saldana, Olivia Wilde, and Mila Kunis. \"There was a big, giant search for Lois,\" Snyder said. \"For us, it was a big thing and obviously a really important role. We did a lot of auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it.\" Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced \"Superman: Flyby\", and the second time for \"Superman Returns\" before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, \"We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful.\" On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an \"independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world.\" Adams said that \"She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on. The nature of the newspaper business has changed so much. There is so much more pressure.\"\nA Kryptonian general with the same superpowers as Superman, bent on transforming Earth into a new Krypton under his reign. Viggo Mortensen and Daniel Day-Lewis were also considered for the role. Snyder stated, \"Zod is not only one of Superman's most formidable enemies, but one of the most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don't. Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character, making him perfect for the role.\" When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain, he stated, \"The way (Christopher) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say, 'Hey, which villain would be cool for this movie?' You start with the story first. What kind of story? What kind of theme do you want to tell? So we worked that out. Then, usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that. When you guys see the movie, the only villain we could've used was Zod and the Kryptonians. I mean, when you see what the whole story is, nothing else would have even made sense.\"\nClark's adoptive father. Snyder explained his reason for his casting the on-screen couple is solely for the realism: \"I think the thing you realize when you look at Diane and Kevin, in our decision to cast them so far, you sort of get a sense of how tonally we're looking at the movie, and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors, and we're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys. You're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is, our first priority is to make sure it's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at.\"\nClark's adoptive mother. Lane was the first cast member to join the film after Cavill. \"This was a very important piece of casting for me because Martha Kent is the woman whose values helped shape the man we know as Superman,\" Snyder said in the release. \"We are thrilled to have Diane in the role because she can convey the wisdom and the wonder of a woman whose son has powers beyond her imagination.\"\nEditor-in-chief of the \"Daily Planet\" and the boss of Lois Lane. Fishburne is the first African-American to play Perry White in a live-action film. Fishburne remarked of his role: \"[M]y inspiration really is the late Ed Bradley, who was a CBS correspondent on \"60 Minutes\" for many years ... [The] legendary Ed Bradley ... was a friend, a mentor, and a role model for me, particularly because he worked in journalism, and he was the kind of guy who walked with kings, but he had the common touch. And so he was my inspiration for Perry.\"\nGeneral Zod's sub-commander and a commander of the Kryptonian military, who is completely devoted and loyal to Zod. Gal Gadot was offered the role but declined because she was pregnant at that time; this allowed her to be later cast as Wonder Woman in . About the role of Faora, Traue said in an interview: \"What I liked about her was that as a woman, we have certain doubts and we think too much sometimes about ourselves and all these things, they're not there for Faora. She's a bred warrior. So to really focus on that aspect, that fear is a chemical reaction and that it was bred out of her and she doesn't have it, it's liberating when you actually think about it. That you're just a one-track mind, there's no filter, there's no double meaning. She gets orders and she answers those orders without a question.\"\nKal-El's biological mother and loyal wife to Jor-El. Julia Ormond had previously been announced as cast, but dropped out. Connie Nielsen was in negotiations for the role before Zurer was cast. Nielsen was subsequently cast as Queen Hippolyta in \"Wonder Woman\".\nA United States Air Force officer, call sign \"Guardian\", assigned to the United States Northern Command.\nA Kryptonian scientist who is Kal-El's biological father. Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also considered for the role. Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor-El, stating that \"... it was one of those things where that's how it was connecting me. That's the question that Jor-El faces, that's the situation that he's in.\" Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that: \"When I signed on ... well, one, I didn't realize that I would be wearing Spandex\u2014'cause you know that's Superman's costume\u2014I didn't realize that I'd have to fit into it as well,\" Crowe said. \"But, I also didn't realize the type of organiser that Zack Snyder is, 'cause this was really old-school prep. This is sort of David Lean-level preparation, and I really appreciated him. And I was on the movie for three and a half or four months before I even got in front of the camera.\"\nCast.\nAdditionally, Harry Lennix plays Lieutenant General Calvin Swanwick, a United States Army general officer and the deputy commander of United States Northern Command. Christina Wren plays Capt. Carrie Ferris, a United States Air Force officer and the assistant to General Swanwick. Richard Schiff plays Dr. Emil Hamilton, a scientist who works with the United States Armed Forces for DARPA. Carla Gugino portrays the voice of Kelor, the Kryptonian AI service-robot. Mackenzie Gray plays Jax-Ur, a Kryptonian scientist who is one of General Zod's followers. Michael Kelly plays Steve Lombard, an employee of the \"Daily Planet\", and Rebecca Buller plays Jenny Jurwich, an intern of the \"Daily Planet\". Jadin Gould, Rowen Kahn, and Jack Foley, respectively, play Lana Lang, Kenny Braverman, and Pete Ross, classmates of Clark Kent in high school. Joseph Cranford portrays Ross as an adult. Richard Cetrone, Samantha Jo, Revard Dufresne and Apollonia Vanova, respectively, play Tor-An, Car-Vex, Dev-Em II and Nadira, Kryptonian soldiers that follow General Zod.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\nIn June 2008, Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers, screenwriters and directors on how to successfully reboot the \"Superman\" film series. Comic book writers Grant Morrison, Mark Waid, Geoff Johns and Brad Meltzer were among those who pitched their ideas for a reboot: \"I told them, it's not that bad. Just treat \"Superman Returns\" as the Ang Lee \"Hulk\", Morrison said. Waid said: \"The Incredible Hulk\" has proven the audience will forgive you and let you redo the franchise\". Morrison's idea was similar to their work on \"All-Star Superman\", while Waid's was akin to \"\". Mark Millar, teaming with director Matthew Vaughn, also planned an epic eight-hour \"Superman\" trilogy, each installment released a year apart, similar to \"The Lord of the Rings\". Millar compared it to \"The Godfather\" trilogy, in which it would chronicle the entire life of Superman, from the early days of Krypton, where little Kal-El witnesses his father's tireless struggle to save the planet, to the finale where Superman loses his powers as the Sun starts to go supernova. According to Millar, Vaughn suggested his \"Stardust\" actor Charlie Cox as a Golden-Age inspired Superman \"when he was a bit more of a regular person\".\nIn August 2008, Warner Bros. suggested a reboot of the film series. Studio executive Jeff Robinov planned to have the film released either by 2010 or 2011, explaining that \"\"Superman Returns\" didn't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to. It didn't position the character the way he needed to be positioned. Had Superman worked in 2006, we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009. Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all.\" Paul Levitz stated in an interview that Batman holds the key to the Superman reboot. He elaborated: \"Everyone is waiting for Nolan to sign on for another Batman, once that happens, the release date for Superman and all other future projects will follow.\" In February 2009, McG, who previously planned to direct \"Superman: Flyby\", expressed interest in returning to the Superman franchise. August 2009 saw a court ruling in which Jerry Siegel's family recaptured 50% of the rights to Superman's origins and Siegel's share of the copyright in \"Action Comics\" #1. In addition, a judge ruled that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films. However, if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011, then the Siegel estate would have been able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film.\nThe plot of \"Man of Steel\" employs a nonlinear narrative, and tells parts of the story in flashbacks. During story discussions for \"The Dark Knight Rises\" in 2008, David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context. Impressed with Goyer's concept, Nolan pitched the idea to the studio, who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of \"The Dark Knight\". Nolan admired Bryan Singer's work on \"Superman Returns\" for its connection to Richard Donner's version, stating that \"a lot of people have approached Superman in a lot of different ways. I only know the way that has worked for us that's what I know how to do\", emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the \"Man of Steel\" would assure the integrity needed for the film. Nolan, however, clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series, in which he commented: \"Each serves to the internal logic of the story. They have nothing to do with each other\".\nRobinov spoke to \"Entertainment Weekly\", and allowed a peek over the wall of secrecy surrounding their DC Comics plans: \"It's setting the tone for what the movies are going to be like going forward. In that, it's definitely a first step.\" Plans included for the film to contain references to the existence of other superheroes, alluding to the possibility of a further DC Universe, and setting the tone for a shared fictional universe of DC Comics characters on film. Guillermo del Toro, with whom Goyer worked on \"Blade II\", turned down the director's position on the reboot because of his commitment on a film adaptation of \"At the Mountains of Madness\", while Robert Zemeckis was also approached. Ben Affleck (who would eventually be cast as Bruce Wayne/Batman in ), Darren Aronofsky, Duncan Jones, Jonathan Liebesman, Matt Reeves (who would later direct a Batman reboot), and Tony Scott were considered as potential directors, before Zack Snyder was hired in October 2010. Casting began the following November. Snyder confirmed both Booster Gold and Batman references in the film, indicating their presence in the DC shared film universe. When Zod destroys a satellite, the words \"Wayne Enterprises\" are scrolled on the satellite.\nThe film's storyboard was created by Filipino-American storyboard artist Jay Oliva, in his first live-action feature film project, along with Snyder. Oliva has cited the Japanese anime shows \"Dragon Ball Z\" and \"Birdy the Mighty\" as an inspiration for the film's epic battle scenes. During the film's brainstorming, Oliva pitched the idea as \"I could come up with something I've never seen in live-action American cinema and only in anime\".\nFilming.\nPrincipal photography began on August 1, 2011, at an industrial park near DuPage Airport under the codename \"Autumn Frost\". Zack Snyder expressed reluctance to shooting the film in 3-D, due to the technical limitations of the format, and instead chose to shoot the film two-dimensionally and convert the film into 3-D in post production, for a 2-D, 3-D, and IMAX 3-D release. Snyder also chose to shoot the film on film instead of digitally, because he felt it would make the film \"a big movie experience\". Cinematographer Amir Mokri shot the film with Panavision Panaflex Millennium XL2 cameras and C-Series anamorphic lenses. Filming was expected to last for two to three months. Production took place in Plano, Illinois on August 22 to 29. According to an interview with Michael Shannon, filming would continue until February 2012.\n\"Man of Steel\" filmed in the Chicago area, California, and Burnaby's Mammoth Studios in Vancouver, which was utilized as a set for Krypton and the extraterrestrial aircraft portrayed in the film. Vancouver's North Shore waterfront area was also used for the oil rig rescue scene where Superman is first introduced. Ucluelet and Nanaimo, British Columbia, feature prominently in the film's first hour\u2014the trademark winter mist and rough seas are passed off as Alaska in the film. Filming took place in the Chicago Loop from September 7 to 17. The Chicago shoot was a unit project, meaning that filming would partake numerous establishing shots as well as cutaways and might not necessarily include principal cast members.\nDesign.\n\"Man of Steel\" features a redesigned Superman costume by James Acheson and Michael Wilkinson. The costume preserves the color scheme and \"S\" logo, but adopts darker tones, and notably does not feature the red trunks usually worn by Superman. Zack Snyder said the costume is \"a modern aesthetic\". He and the producers attempted to devise a suit featuring the red trunks, but could not design one that fit into the tone of the film, leading to their removal from the suit. Because of Wilkinson's unavailability, Snyder chose Acheson to design the suit; however, he only started developing it, and Wilkinson finished the development when he returned, and designed the other character's costumes as well. Due to the substantial weight a practical suit would yield, the Kryptonian armor for General Zod was constructed through CGI to allow Shannon \"freedom of movement\". In a March 2014 interview with \"Esquire\", Wilkinson explained the reason for the look of Superman's redesigned suit:\nEffects.\nJohn \"DJ\" Desjardin served as the visual supervisor for \"Man of Steel\", with Weta Digital, MPC and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film. Zack Snyder wanted the film to \"appear very natural because there's some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief, and we the visual effects team had to make it as easy as possible for them to do so.\" Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a \"documentary-style\" film. Desjardin said: \"We had to think about what that would mean, since we also had to photograph some crazy action. So for a lot of the previs we did, we'd start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was. A lot of the rules are the \"Battlestar Galactica\" rules for the space cams that Gary Hurtzel developed for that miniseries, where we want to make sure if we're translating the camera at all it makes sense. Unless the action is so over the top, like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod\u2014we had to break it a bit.\"\nFor the first act of the film taking place on the planet Krypton, Weta Digital placed alien-like planet environments, creatures and the principal means of display\u2014a technology the filmmakers called \"liquid geometry\". Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Dan Lemmon explained that \"it's a bunch of silver beads that are suspended through a magnetic field, and the machine is able to control that magnetic field so that the collection of beads behave almost like three-dimensional pixels, and they can create a surface that floats in the air and describes whatever the thing is you're supposed to be seeing.\" The beads of the display, which up close would appear to be pyramids with a slight bevel, were designed to create a surface of the object to depict inside a \"console-like\" figure.\nIn the modeling and animation aspect of the liquid geometry, Goodwin explained: \"We had to develop a pipeline to bring in assets, so instead of going through the route of reducing the polygon count to something usable what we would then do\u2014you would take the model in whatever way it was made and just scatter discrete points onto it, and extract the matrix onto the animation and copy these points onto the matrix and have these sparse points behaving in a way that the model would.\" After the animation, artists duplicated the beads onto the animated geometry for a pre-simulated lighting version to get approval on how the object would read. Sims were then run \"on all the targets which would be discrete beads floating around on top of the surface which would have its own set of parameters\", in which Goodwin further explained: \"The bead size or the turbulence that would crawl along the surface constantly updating the orientation was based on the normal provided by the surface. That was then saved to disk and we would use that sim as the final target for the simulation.\" After the simulation process, Weta Digital ran every bead through a temporal filter to remove jitter to control the noise. Lighting solutions directly worked on the set. Weta utilized RenderMan to take advantage of improved ray tracing and instancing objects.\nThe sequences where Superman utilizes close-combat fight scenes with the other Kryptonians proved to be a major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew. Desjardin explained: \"When we do these fights and these hyper-real things, we don't want to do the traditional, 'OK I'm a cameraman, I'm shooting a clean plate, I'm going to pan over here to follow the action that's not really there yet but we'll put the action in later. Because that's us animating the characters to the camera. So we would do that animation with the characters\u2014grappling, punching or flying away\u2014and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we'd cut. Then we'd put an environment camera there and take the environment. And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment. So then we had a set of high-res stills for the environment and the characters. Then, in post, we take the digi-doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment.\"\nMPC handled the visual effects for the \"Smallville encounter\" sequence. Before providing the visual effects, the shots were previsualized for the fight choreography. After the previsualizations, live action portions of the scene would be filmed in small pieces: \"If say Superman was being punched and would land 50 meters away, we would shoot our start position and end position, and then bridge that gap with the CG takeovers\", says Guillaume Rocheron, the MPC visual effects supervisor. A camera rig would then obtain key frames of the choreographed actor; Desjardin said \"it's a six-still camera rig that's built on a pipe rig so that you can run it in at the end of a setup and get stills of key frames of a performance or an expression, and then we could use those hi-res stills to project onto the CG double and get really accurate transition lighting and color\u2014right from the set.\"\nOn set, a camera rig was used to capture the environment of the sequence. Dubbed \"enviro-cam\", the visual effects crew would mount a Canon EOS 5D and a motorized nodal head, allowing the crew to capture the environment at a 360-degree angle with 55K resolution for every shot, the process would take approximately two to four minutes. The set capture resulted in lighting and textures that could be reprojected onto geometry. Full-screen digital doubles were a major component for the fighting sequences. Digital armor was also added, along with the energy-based Kryptonian helmets. Cyberscan and FACS were conducted with the actors, and polarized and non-polarized reference photos were taken. Superman's cape and costume were scanned in high detail\u2014the cape in particular became a direct extension of Superman's actions.\nFor the sequences involving the terraforming of the city Metropolis, Double Negative handled the visual effects for the sequence. In order to construct a Metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic, Double Negative utilized Esri's CityEngine to help procedurally deliver the city. According to Ged Wright, a Double Negative visual effects supervisor, it was a much more sci-fi based role, \"so we took what they had done and extended it a great deal. The work we were doing was based around the Downtowns for New York, L.A. and Chicago and that gave us the building volumes for heights. We'd skin those volumes with kit parts, but most of it then had to fall down! So we had to rig it for destruction and use it for other aspects of the work as well.\"\nFor the destruction of the buildings, the studio rewrote its own asset system to focus towards its dynamic events. The Bullet physics software was a heavily impacted component for the utilization of the destruction. Wright said that \"we wanted to be able to run an RBD event and trigger all these secondary events, whether it was glass or dust simulations\u2014all of those things needed to be chained up and handled in a procedural way. One of the advantages of this was that, because it was all based around a limited number of input components, you can make sure they're modeled in a way they're usable in effects\u2014you can model something but they'll be another stage to rig it for destruction.\" Fire, smoke, and water stimulation tools were developed at the Double Negative studio. The studio transitioned between the existing proprietary volume rendering software to rendering in Mantra for elements such as fireball sims. Double Negative also used the in-house fluids tool \"Squirt\" to handle larger-scale sims and interaction for more tightly coupled volumes and particles. Regarding the battle between Superman and Zod, Double Negative implemented real photography onto its digital doubles.\nMusic.\nHans Zimmer initially denied popular rumors that he would be composing the film's score, but in June 2012, it was confirmed that Zimmer would, in fact, be doing so after all. To completely distinguish \"Man of Steel\" from the previous films, the iconic \"Superman March\" by John Williams was not used. Hans Zimmer's soundtrack for \"Man of Steel\" was released publicly on June 11, 2013. An unofficial rip of the musical score from the third trailer, entitled \"An Ideal of Hope\", confirmed to be a cut-down version of the track \"What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World?\", was released on April 19. In late April, the official track listing of the two-CD deluxe edition was revealed.\nThemes.\nMany reviewers interpreted \"Man of Steel\" as a religious allegory, especially since Warner Bros. set up a website that contains \"a nine-page pamphlet entitled \"Jesus: The Original Superhero\"\". Justin Craig compares Kal-El's struggle to the Passion of Christ, stating that \"Kal-El is more than willing to sacrifice himself to save the people of Earth. Originally reluctant to reveal his identity and powers to the world, Superman decides to turn himself over to Zod to save humanity from annihilation.\" Craig also states that there is an allegory to the Trinity within \"Man of Steel\": \"Jor-El returns to Kal-El on Earth as a ghost, guiding his budding superhero son on his journey to salvation. Before Jor-El sends his son off to Earth baby Moses-style, he tells his wife that, like Jesus, 'He'll be a god to them.'\" Paul Asay of \"The Washington Post\" writes that \"Superman floats in space with his arms splayed out as if nailed to an invisible cross,\" a fact that Craig also mentioned in his assessment of the film. The protagonist of the film is also 33 years old and seeks \"counsel at a church.\" Writing for \"The Huffington Post\", Colin Liotta compared Zod to Adolf Hitler, citing: \"He feels his vision for a pure Krypton (i.e. a society like the one Hitler envisioned with his eugenics program) is the only answer for survival.\"\nMarketing.\nWarner Bros. and DC Comics won the rights to the domain name manofsteel.com, in use by a member of the public, for use for the film's official website. On November 20, 2012, for the release of \"The Dark Knight Rises\" DVD and Blu-ray, Warner Bros. launched a countdown on the film's website where fans could share the countdown on websites like Facebook or Twitter to unlock an \"exclusive reward\". On December 3, 2012, the \"exclusive reward\" was revealed to be an official \"Man of Steel\" teaser poster. The poster, which depicts Superman being arrested, generated a positive response and much speculation about the film's story. On December 10, 2012, a website appeared at dsrwproject.com that provided audio signals to be decoded by viewers. It was discovered to be related to the film due to the copyright on the website. By December 11, 2012, the decoded message led readers to another website with a countdown that led to the public release of the trailer. In anticipation of the film, Mattel unveiled a toy line which includes Movie Masters action figures. In addition, Lego released three \"Man of Steel\" sets, inspired by scenes from the film; Rubie's Costume Co. also released a new line of \"Man of Steel\"-inspired costumes and accessories for both kids and adults. The film has reportedly earned over $160 million from promotional tie-ins.\nViral marketing campaigns for the film began when the official website was replaced by \"deep space radio waves\". The message was decoded to reveal a voice that said \"You Are Not Alone\". The official site continued to be updated with new static files that slowly revealed the symbol for the film's villain, General Zod. Shortly after, the website was replaced with a \"message\" from Zod, who requested that Earth must return Kal-El to his custody and told Kal-El to surrender within 24 hours or the world would suffer the consequences. A viral site called \"IWillFindHim.com\" was released that showed a countdown to the third trailer for the film.\nWarner Bros. enlisted Christian-based marketing firm Grace Hill Media to help spread the Christian themes of the film to the religious demographics. Special trailers were created outlining the religious tones, due to Hollywood studios frequently marketing movies to specific religious and cultural groups. Warner Bros. previously marketed films such as \"The Blind Side\", \"The Notebook\", \"The Book of Eli\" and the \"Harry Potter\" series to faith-based groups. Warner Bros. also asked Professor Craig Detweiler of Pepperdine University to \"create a Superman-centric sermon outline for pastors titled \"Jesus: The Original Superhero\".\" Regarding this, Paul Asay of \"The Washington Post\" wrote that \"the religious themes keep coming: Free will. Sacrifice. God-given purpose. \"Man of Steel\" isn't just a movie. It's a Bible study in a cape. The messages are so strong that its marketers been explicitly pushing the film to Christian audiences.\"\nRelease.\nTheatrical.\n\"Man of Steel\" held a red carpet premiere at the Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall in New York City on June 10, 2013, which featured the attendance of the principal cast members. The film received a wide release on June 14, 2013, in conventional, 3D, and IMAX theaters.\nHome media.\n\"Man of Steel\" was released as a single-disc DVD (feature film only), on two-disc DVD with bonus features, and respective Blu-ray and Blu-ray 3D combo packs on November 12, 2013, and in the United Kingdom on December 2, 2013. As of January 2019, \"Man of Steel\" has sold more than 2.3 million DVDs along with an estimated of 3.3 million Blu-ray Discs totaling $44.2 million and $76 million, respectively, for a total of $120.4 million in sales. The film was later released in 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray format on July 19, 2016.\nReception.\nBox office.\n\"Man of Steel\" grossed $291 million in the United States and Canada, and $377 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $668 million, making it the highest-grossing solo Superman film of all time and the second-highest when adjusting for inflation. It is also the second-highest-grossing reboot of all time behind \"The Amazing Spider-Man\". \"Deadline Hollywood\" calculated the net profit of the film to be $42.7million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues, making it the ninth most profitable release of 2013. The film earned $116.6 million on its opening weekend, including $17.5 million from IMAX theaters. \"Man of Steel\" earned an additional $120 million from DVD and Blu-ray sales.\n\"Man of Steel\" made $12 million from a Thursday night Walmart screening program, and an additional $9 million from midnight shows. This marked Warner Bros.' third-highest advance night/midnight opening, and the biggest advance night/midnight debut for a non-sequel. The film eventually earned $44 million during its opening Friday (including midnight grosses) and $56.1 million when the Thursday night showings are included. The opening-day gross was the second-highest for a non-sequel, and the 20th-largest overall. Its opening weekend gross of $116.6 million was the third-highest of 2013, behind \"Iron Man 3\" ($174.1 million) and \"\" ($158.1 million), and the third-highest among non-sequels, behind \"Marvel's The Avengers\" ($207.4 million) and \"The Hunger Games\" ($152.5 million). It also broke \"Toy Story 3\"s record ($110.3 million) for the highest weekend debut in June (the record was again broken two years later by \"Jurassic World\"s opening gross of $208.8 million). However, on its second weekend, \"Man of Steel\"s box office fell almost 65%\u201368% if the Thursday night gross is included\u2014putting it in third place, behind \"Monsters University\" and \"World War Z\". Box Office Mojo called it an \"abnormally large drop,\" close to the second-weekend decline for \"Green Lantern\".\n\"Man of Steel\" earned $73.3 million on its opening weekend from 24 countries, which includes $4.2 million from 79 IMAX theaters, setting a June opening-weekend record for IMAX. The film set an opening-day record in the Philippines with $1.66 million. In the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta, the film earned $5.6 million on its opening day and \u00a311.2 million ($17.47 million) on its opening weekend. Its biggest opener outside the United States was in China, with $25.9 million in four days (Thursday to Sunday). In total earnings, its three largest countries after North America are China ($63.4 million), the United Kingdom, Ireland and Malta ($46.2 million) and Australia ($22.3 million).\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 56% based on 338 reviews, with an average rating of 6.20/10. The site's consensus reads, \"\"Man of Steel\"s exhilarating action and spectacle can't fully overcome its detours into generic blockbuster territory.\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted score of 55 out of 100, based on 47 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". Audience polls in North America from CinemaScore for the film tallied an average grade of an \"A\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale, with those under the age of 18 and older than 50 giving it an \"A\". Cavill's performance as Superman earned mixed reviews, with some critics commenting on perceived stiffness and a lack of charisma.\nRichard Roeper of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" said that \"Man of Steel\" covered no new ground with regard to Superman films, and instead, \"we're plunged back into a mostly-underwhelming film, with underdeveloped characters and supercharged-fight scenes that drag on and offer nothing new in the way of special-effects creativity\". \"The Boston Globe\"s Ty Burr wrote, \"What's missing from this Superman saga is a sense of lightness, of pop joy\". \"The Washington Post\"s Ann Hornaday stated that with \"Hans Zimmer's turgid, over-produced score\", the film \"is an exceptionally-unpleasant viewing experience\". For \"The Denver Post\"s Lisa Kennedy, the chief problem with \"Man of Steel\" is the \"rhythm and balance in the storytelling and directing\" which resulted in a film that swings \"between destructive overstatement and flat-footed homilies.\"\nKofi Outlaw, Editor-in-Chief at \"Screen Rant\", gave \"Man of Steel\" a 4-out-of-5-star review, stating that \"\"Man of Steel\" has more than earned its keep, and deserves to be THE iconic Superman movie for a whole new generation\". He would go on to name \"Man of Steel\" the best superhero movie of 2013. Jim Vejvoda of \"IGN\" gave \"Man of Steel\" a 9 out of 10 while praising the action sequences and the performances of Kevin Costner, Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon. The performance of Antje Traue as Superman's adversary Faora-Ul, particularly in the Smallville battle scenes, has also been lauded. Peter Travers of \"Rolling Stone\" gave it 3 stars out of 4, saying, \"Caught in the slipstream between action and angst, \"Man of Steel\" is a bumpy ride for sure. But there's no way to stay blind to its wonders.\" Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said rebooting the franchise was unnecessary, but that the film was confident enough and Snyder's attention to detail careful enough that audiences could overlook another reboot. \"PopMatters\" journalist J.C. Ma\u00e7ek III, wrote, \"The path of this flawed savior isn't quite the one that we have been led to expect and many fans will love that and many fans will decry its comic book-divergent choices. On the other hand, barring Lois Lane's own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman (thus depriving one of fiction's greatest reveals), the hero we see in the final moments of \"Man of Steel\" is nothing if not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created ... with just a bit more in the 'imperfections' column.\" Steve Persall of the \"Tampa Bay Times\" stated that, \"\"Man of Steel\" is more than just \"Avengers\"-sized escapism; it's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew.\" \"Time\" magazine's Richard Corliss said, \"The movie finds its true, lofty footing not when it displays Kal-El's extraordinary powers, but when it dramatizes Clark Kent's roiling humanity. The super part of \"Man of Steel\" is just okay, but the man part is super.\" In a review on Roger Ebert's website, Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars, calling it an \"astonishing movie\" and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod. But he criticized the film for not having more personal and intimate moments between Clark and Lois. In 2014, \"Empire\" ranked \"Man of Steel\" the 286th-greatest film ever made on their list of \"The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time\" as voted by the magazine's readers.\nSpeaking to Fox Business Channel, Grae Drake, senior editor of Rotten Tomatoes, expressed dismay over the critical reception, stating, \"As much as I love and respect our critics at Rotten Tomatoes, I've got to say I am shocked. Listen, the movie's not perfect but ... I just cannot fathom it. It was a good movie, you guys.\"\nReaction to the film among comics creators was mixed. Those who enjoyed it include Jeff Parker, Heidi MacDonald, Ethan Van Sciver, Christos Gage and former Superman writer Dan Jurgens. Among its detractors were Joe Keatinge, Sean McKeever, Gabriel Hardman and Mark Waid. MacDonald praised the film's action, drama and leads Henry Cavill and Amy Adams. Van Sciver singled out Cavill in particular for praise. Gage called it the best \"Superman\" film since 1980's \"Superman II\". Hardman said that he liked a lot of the mechanics but did not connect with the characters, which robbed the story of tension. Waid, who wrote the origin miniseries \"\", criticized the film for its overall \"joyless\" tone, and for Superman's decision to kill Zod, a criticism echoed by other creators. Writer Grant Morrison, who wrote the critically acclaimed miniseries \"All-Star Superman\", expressed mixed reaction to the film, saying that while they \"kinda liked it and kinda didn't\", it did not present anything new, as they would have preferred a \"second act\" type story with Lex Luthor instead of re-establishing the character by presenting information Morrison is already familiar with. Morrison also questioned the need for a superhero to kill, as did artist Neal Adams. Adams suggested that other alternatives were open to Superman when Zod threatened innocent people with his vision of heat, such as covering his eyes. He also criticized Superman for not moving the battle away from Metropolis as the character did at the end of \"Superman II\". Jim Lee had a positive opinion: \"It\u2019s epic. It\u2019s got a lot of heart, but one of the things that was kind of missing from the last Superman movie I think was the action, and this movie has it in spades. I mean it is a visual thrill ride. It is amazing. You get to see all the powers of Superman, and in all its glory, and I think people are going to be blown away.\"\nFuture.\nDC Extended Universe.\nThe success of \"Man of Steel\" started Warner Bros. plans of a cinematic universe featuring other DC Comics characters. In June 2013, Goyer was hired to write the sequel to \"Man of Steel\", as well as a \"Justice League\" script, with the previous draft being scrapped. In July 2013, Zack Snyder announced at San Diego Comic-Con International that the sequel to \"Man of Steel\" would have Superman and Batman meeting for the first time in the next film. Cavill, Adams, Lane and Fishburne were signed on to reprise their roles. Snyder stated that the film would take inspiration from the comic \"The Dark Knight Returns\". In August 2013, Ben Affleck was announced to be playing Batman, while Gal Gadot was cast as Wonder Woman in December 2013. Later in December, Chris Terrio was hired to rewrite the script. In January 2014, it was announced that the film had been delayed from its original July 17, 2015 release date to May 6, 2016. In April 2014, it was announced that Snyder would also be directing Goyer's \"Justice League\" script. In May 2014, the film's title was revealed to be \"\". Warner Bros. was reportedly courting Terrio to rewrite \"Justice League\" the following July, after having been pleased with his rewrite of \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\". While Superman star Henry Cavill does not consider it a Superman sequel, Snyder stated that he \"thinks in a way \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\" is \"Man of Steel 2\"\".\nPossible sequel or reboot.\nIn August 2016, \"TheWrap\" reported that Warner Bros. put the film in active development as a top priority. The news of a stand-alone \"Superman\" film were later confirmed by Dany Garcia, Cavill's manager. While promoting \"Arrival\", Amy Adams confirmed that work had begun on the screenplay. In March 2017, it was announced that Matthew Vaughn was being eyed by Warner Bros. to direct. In April 2018, it was reported that Christopher McQuarrie was considering directing the film but later dropped it. In May 2019, however, \"Polygon\" reported that Vaughn is no longer in negotiations to direct the sequel, adding that the sequel was going to include some ideas Vaughn and Mark Millar initially pitched in 2008 for their proposed \"Superman\" trilogy, whose first film would have taken place mostly on Krypton. In July 2019, McQuarrie revealed that he and Cavill had pitched a \"Superman\" film and a \"Green Lantern\" film for the studio, but they were rejected. On January 2020, James Gunn said that he was offered to direct a Superman film, which he declined in favor of directing \"The Suicide Squad\". However, he denied the film was going to be a sequel to \"Man of Steel\"."}
{"title": "Birdman_(film)", "label": "Film", "text": "Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) is a 2014 American black comedy-drama film directed by Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu. It was written by I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris Jr., and Armando B\u00f3. The film stars Michael Keaton as Riggan Thomson, a faded Hollywood actor best known for playing the superhero \"Birdman\", as he struggles to mount a Broadway adaptation of a short story by Raymond Carver. The film also features a supporting cast of Zach Galifianakis, Edward Norton, Andrea Riseborough, Amy Ryan, Emma Stone, and Naomi Watts.\nThe film covers the period of previews leading to the play's opening, and with a brief exception appears as if filmed in a single shot, an idea I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had from the film's conception. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki believed that the recording time necessary for the long take approach taken in \"Birdman\" could not have been made with older technology. The film was shot in New York City during the spring of 2013 with a budget of $16.5 million jointly financed by Fox Searchlight Pictures, Regency Enterprises and Worldview Entertainment. It premiered the following year in August where it opened the 71st Venice International Film Festival.\n\"Birdman\" had a limited theatrical release in the United States on October 17, 2014, followed by a wide release on November 14. Grossing more than $103 million worldwide, the film received widespread critical acclaim, with praise towards its screenplay, direction, cinematography, and the performances of the cast (particularly Keaton, Norton, and Stone). \"Birdman\" won the Academy Award for Best Picture, along with Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography from a total of nine nominations, tying it with \"The Grand Budapest Hotel\" for the most nominated and awarded film at the 87th Academy Awards. It also won Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture at the 21st Screen Actors Guild Awards, as well as Best Actor in a Musical or Comedy for Keaton and Best Screenplay at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards.\nPlot.\nRiggan Thomson is a faded actor famous for playing a superhero named Birdman in a film trilogy in the 1990s. He is tormented by the mocking and critical internal voice of Birdman and frequently visualizes himself performing feats of levitation and telekinesis. Riggan is trying to regain recognition by writing, directing, and starring in a Broadway adaptation of Raymond Carver's short story, \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\". However, the Birdman voice wants Riggan to return to blockbuster cinema and insists that he is an essential part of Riggan's identity.\nJake, Riggan's best friend and lawyer, is producing the play, which co-stars Riggan's girlfriend, Laura, and Broadway d\u00e9butante Lesley. Riggan's daughter Sam, a recovering drug addict with whom he is trying to reconnect, is working as his assistant. The day before the first preview, a light fixture falls onto Riggan's hapless co-star, Ralph. At Lesley's suggestion, Riggan replaces Ralph with her boyfriend, the brilliant but volatile and self-absorbed method actor Mike Shiner. The first previews are disastrous: Mike breaks character over the replacement of his gin with water, attempts to rape Lesley during a sex scene, and claims that the prop gun does not look real. Riggan clashes continually with Mike, culminating in a brawl after Riggan reads a New York Times interview with Mike in which he steals Riggan's personal reason for doing a Raymond Carver play. Jake persuades Riggan to continue with the play. When Riggan berates Sam after finding her using marijuana, she insultingly rebukes and chastises him, telling him he is irrelevant and the play is for his own vanity.\nDuring the final preview, Riggan accidentally locks himself outside with his robe stuck in the fire escape door. He is forced to walk through Times Square in his white briefs and enter through the audience to do the final scene. A concerned Sam is waiting in his dressing room after the show. She thinks the performance was very unusual but interesting. She shows him that the Times Square footage is going viral and explains how this actually helps him.\nRiggan goes to a bar for a drink and approaches Tabitha Dickinson, a cynical and highly influential theater critic. She promises to \"kill\" his play with a deprecating review without even having seen it. On the way back, Riggan buys a pint of whiskey, drinks it, and passes out on a stoop. The next day, walking to the theater with a severe hangover, he visualizes Birdman trying to convince him to abandon the play and make a fourth Birdman film. Riggan then imagines himself flying through the streets of Manhattan before arriving at the theater.\nOn opening night, the play is going very well. In his dressing room, a strangely calm Riggan confesses to his ex-wife, Sylvia, that several years ago he attempted to drown himself in the ocean after she caught him having an affair. He also tells her about the Birdman voice, which she ignores. After Sylvia leaves, Riggan picks up a real gun for the final scene in which his character commits suicide. At the climax, Riggan shoots himself in the head on stage. The play receives a standing ovation.\nRiggan wakes up in a hospital \u2014 the suicide attempt merely blew off his nose, which has been surgically reconstructed. Tabitha has published a glowing review of the play, calling the suicide attempt just what American theater needed. Sam visits with flowers and takes a picture of him to share with the skyrocketing number of followers on the Twitter account she has created for him. While she steps outside to find a vase, Riggan goes into the bathroom, removes the bandages revealing his swollen new nose, and says goodbye to Birdman, seen seated on the toilet. Fascinated by the birds flying outside his room, he opens the window, peers up at them, and then climbs out onto the ledge. Sam returns to an empty room and frantically runs to the open window, scanning the ground before slowly looking up into the sky and smiling.\nProduction.\nDevelopment.\n\"Birdman\" director Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu originally conceived the film as a comedy filmed in a single shot set in a theatre. The original choice behind the film's genre, which was subsequently re-adapted to concentrate on Riggan's final emotional tail spin, came from the director wanting to see a change in his approach. All his previous films were dramas, and after directing \"Biutiful\", he did not want to approach his new film in the same tragic manner again. The decision to make the film appear as a single shot came from his realization that \"we live our lives with no editing\". By presenting the film as a continuous shot, he could \"submerge the protagonist in an 'inescapable reality' and take the audience with him\". I\u00f1\u00e1rritu shared his idea with the Argentine screenwriters/cousins Nicol\u00e1s Giacobone and Armando Bo, as well as playwright Alexander Dinelaris, Jr., who had all worked with him on his previous film. Their first reaction was to tell him the continuous-shot idea could not work. According to Dinelaris and Giacobone, \"huge\" and \"important\" people told him to not even try the project for the same reason. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu himself described the technique as \"almost suicidal\", worrying that it would be distracting, instead of immersive. Dinelaris later said that had they truly paused and considered the idea, they might have talked I\u00f1\u00e1rritu out of it.\nThe personal and vocational experiences of the four co-writers were central to writing the script. Dinelaris' exposure to Broadway shaped the depictions of rehearsals and events backstage, though he admitted exaggerating these. He also felt his background writing long scenes of dialogue helped since scenes in the film \"were really more like play scenes\". I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's own experiences influenced many of \"Birdman\"s themes. \"What this film talks about, I have been through\", I\u00f1\u00e1rritu recalled. \"I have seen and experienced all of it; it's what I have been living through the last years of my life.\" Dinelaris described this aspect as \"a laughing look at oneself\", but said it had to be done in a comedic way; otherwise, \"it would have been the most unbelievably self-absorbed look at the subject\". Themes from Raymond Carver's short story \"What We Talk About When We Talk About Love\", which Riggan adapts for stage in the story, also influenced the script. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu wanted to find the connection between the themes in Riggan's story and those of Carver's. Because of this, it was important to the director that Carver's story be the subject of the play depicted within the film. Therefore, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu stated that his desire to use Carver's work was \"terrifying\" because the rights to using the Carver material were still subject to the possibility of being rejected during development of the film, but no issues arose. Carver's widow, writer Tess Gallagher, loved the script and permitted the adaptation, saying that Carver would be laughing about the film.\nWhile some aspects of the film the first frame with Riggan, for instance went unchanged from \"Birdman's\" conception to release, others went through several iterations. One of these was the sequence in which alter ego Birdman takes complete control over Riggan's thoughts. The writers knew it would occur at Riggan's lowest point, so at one stage planned for it to happen after Riggan hears the initial negative press coverage and destroys his dressing room. In another discarded version, Riggan tries to drown himself in Central Park and flies out to save himself.\nThe film's ending also changed, the final version being written halfway through filming. The original intended to depict Johnny Depp in Riggan's dressing room with a \"Pirates of the Caribbean\" poster in the back. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu grew to strongly dislike this ending, calling it \"so embarrassing\", and rewrote it with Dinelaris and Giacobone after a new ending came to him in a dream. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was reluctant to describe the original ending, but it was leaked by Dinelaris. He said the original ending was set in the theatre, instead of the hospital, and involved Depp putting on Riggan Thomson's wig, and in Jack Sparrow's voice, \"... the poster asks Depp, 'What the fuck are we doing here, mate?', and it was going to be the satire of the endless loop of that.\" The director and co-authors ruled out the satirical ending, and favored the new, more ambiguous, ending.\nThe project of co-writing was expedited by the collaboration between the four co-writers on the internet working from different geographical locations. With I\u00f1\u00e1rritu in Los Angeles, Giacobone and Bo in Buenos Aires, and Dinelaris in New York, the script was mainly written through Skype calls and emails. Although this complicated the writing process, Dinelaris said he believed the best ideas in \"Birdman\" came from Skype sessions at two in the morning where he and Giacobone were \"cracking each other up\". Incorporating the one-shot feature also affected the writing. Bo said: \"We wrote everything thinking of this one shot, and a lot of decisions that would mostly be taken in the editing room were taken before shooting\". The one-shot approach meant the scenes could not be removed or re-ordered in post-production, so the writers needed to be \"very, very sure about what was on the page\". As a result, it took about a year and a half to complete the final draft. As Dinelaris summarized: \"You have to be an idiot to do it all in one shot. You have to be an idiot to attempt it. It takes a great, great deal of ignorance to not pay attention to the difficulties and to think you're going to do this. \"Birdman\" looks like a good idea now, but [at the time of production] we did not know how we would land.\"\nCasting.\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu cast several of the leading roles before the film was financed. Among these was the lead role. Early in script development, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu did not have Keaton in mind, but he had changed his mind by the end: \"When I finished the script, I knew that Michael was not the choice or option, he was the guy\". I\u00f1\u00e1rritu cast Keaton for his depth in a variety of acting styles: He could handle the demands of the stage, up-close work, and comedy and empathy \"with a profound depth to both\".\nKeaton knew about \"Birdman\" before I\u00f1\u00e1rritu contacted him. He was in the middle of production of another project when he learned that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was making another film. Keaton, a fan of his work, flew home to find out more. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu sent him the script and they discussed it over dinner. The first thing Keaton asked the director was whether he was making fun of him (regarding his role in Tim Burton's \"Batman\" films), but after I\u00f1\u00e1rritu explained the role, its technicalities, and the film's production, Keaton agreed to play Riggan.\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu called his decision behind casting Galifianakis as Jake \"a bet\". Galifianakis met the director's criteria of being lovable and funny, but I\u00f1\u00e1rritu also considered him sensitive, which scored him the role. Emma Stone already knew she wanted to work with I\u00f1\u00e1rritu before she was offered the role of Sam. The script that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu gave her and the rest of the cast came with the photo \"Man on Wire\", which featured Philippe Petit crossing the Twin Towers on a tightrope. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu told the cast, \"We are doing that\".\nOnce these actors were committed, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu sought funding. He first invited Fox Searchlight Pictures to finance the project, but they turned his offer down because they felt his asking budget was too high. At one stage Megan Ellison of Annapurna Pictures wanted to be involved in the project, but decided against it because, unlike her other films, she had not been involved since the beginning. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu approached Brad Weston, president of New Regency, who accepted the offer. When executive Claudia Lewis of Searchlight heard about the deal, she reconsidered and asked to be included in the deal. Searchlight and New Regency had previously worked together to finance \"12 Years a Slave\", and they decided to join together for \"Birdman\", financing a budget of $16.5 million.\nWeston and Lewis developed a close relationship with I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, editing the script with him and switching some of the actors. When they joined production, Josh Brolin was set to play the role of Mike Shiner, but the financiers decided to switch him for Norton because of scheduling conflicts.\nHe said Norton's experience as a theatre actor, combined with his self-confidence, meant that \"in a way, there was some kind of mental reality to Edward\", but Norton believes he was the one who convinced I\u00f1\u00e1rritu to take him on. Norton was a fan of the director's work and impressed with his ability to push outside film-making boundaries. Norton heard about I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's project from a friend. Once he got the script, he read it straight through until 3:00 am. Norton said, \"I laughed so hard I woke people up.\" Norton wanted to meet I\u00f1\u00e1rritu the next day, and once they met, Norton told him he could not cast someone who was the \"embodiment\" of what the script was taking aim at. Instead, the director needed to cast someone \"who has at least a little bit of authentic depth of experience, in this world\". I\u00f1\u00e1rritu agreed.\nAmy Ryan, one of the last actors to be cast, was invited because I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had seen her in the play \"Detroit\". Lindsay Duncan had vast experience in the theatre world too, and decided to accept the offer to play the critic because of the quality of the script. \"It's delicious because of the writing.\" But like Shiner's character, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu found casting Laura difficult. Riseborough met him on a street corner for a cup of tea, and recalling the event, said, \"I told him that I would crawl across hot coals to work with him\". I\u00f1\u00e1rritu described Laura as \"a very wacky, quirky role\", but said, \"when [Andrea Riseborough] did it, I knew that it was her, because she did it right in the tone, and she understood who she was \u2013 she was not judging\".\nRehearsal and filming.\nOnce the writing was finished, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu contacted friend and cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki to discuss his idea for the film. After reading the script, Lubezki was worried that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu would offer him the job since \"Birdman\" \"had all of the elements of a movie that I did not want to do at all\" comedy, studio work and long takes but changed his mind after further discussion with the director. The pair had worked together on commercials and a short film in the anthology \"To Each His Own Cinema\", but not on any feature films. Lubezki wanted to be sure that this was a decision Rodrigo Prieto, cinematographer of all four of I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's feature films, was comfortable with, but after receiving his blessing, the two headed into pre-production.\nLubezki was concerned that no film had been shot in the way I\u00f1\u00e1rritu envisioned, meaning there would be no reference material to look up. The two decided the only way to learn how to shoot it would be to shoot it themselves, so they hired a warehouse in Sony Studios, Los Angeles, and built a proxy stage. The setup was minimal. Canvas and C-stands were used for walls, while tape and a few pieces of furniture marked out areas. Using a camera and some stand-ins, the duo worked through the movie to see if it was possible. Realizing no theatre could accommodate the intricate camerawork they needed, they hired Kaufman Astoria Studios in New York. Still, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu wanted to shoot at a Broadway theater, but would have to wait until several weeks into rehearsals before securing St. James Theatre. They then spent a few months designing and making \"blueprints\" of the shots and blocking the scenes, using the stand-ins to read and walk through the script. The planning was precise. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu said: \"There was no room to improvise at all. Every movement, every line, every door opening, absolutely everything was rehearsed.\" The actors started rehearsing once this preliminary work was completed: According to Lubezki, they did the scenes with the actors \"once we kind of knew what the rhythm of the scenes were\". He described the atypical approach \"like an upside down movie where you do post-production before the production\".\nEditors Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione were involved in the project by this stage. When I\u00f1\u00e1rritu told Mirrione that he planned for Lubezki to record table readings and the rehearsals, he suggested they edit them immediately to discover what was and was not working early on. The editing also allowed the editors to discuss pacing issues with the director, such as the position of the night-day transitions and other moments of rest in the film. Production designer Kevin Thompson was on hand too, and mapped out the scenes. The camerawork required many elements of the set to be built in a certain way. For example, Riggan's makeup mirror and desk were constructed so that the camera would see his reflection. Thompson also took into consideration the needs of the crew, for instance designing the stairs a little wider for Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff's footsize.\nHe then constructed a template of the set they would build when in New York. The writers were also involved in the rehearsals, fine-tuning the script to \"make sure the film was fluid and never stopped\".\nOnce the logistics of the scenes were worked out and they had the timing down, the team headed to Kaufman Studios for more rehearsals, followed by principal photography based exclusively in New York during the spring of 2013. The studios were used to film the backstage areas of the film, including Riggan's dressing room and the theatre corridors. St. James Theatre was used for two weeks; it was the location for the stage scenes. The bar segments were shot in The Rum House on 47th Street, and 43rd Street was used for the action-sequence. The film was unable to be shot chronologically because of scheduling with the theatre. Throughout the locations, including the studio, the scenes were lit with natural light, since Lubezki wanted the movie \"to look as naturalistic as possible\". The night-time scenes were possible to film in this way due to the brightness of New York. Lubezki found lighting the scenes to be the hardest part of his work on the film. Not only did the lighting need to look realistic, but also had to be designed so that the continuous movements of the camera did not project the crew's shadows onto the actors.\nThroughout shooting, Arri Alexa cameras were used; an Alexa M was used for handheld sequences, and an Alexa XT was attached to the Steadicam. Neither used matte boxes, however. Steadicam operator Chris Haarhoff explained this decision: \"We didn't want this big black thing gliding into their eyeline. This way we could get very close and get the light past the lens and onto the actor's face.\" Lubezki who did all the handheld camerawork had chosen the Alexa M because the camera was very small and allowed him to get into tiny spaces and close to the actors, sometimes filming two inches (5 cm) away from Keaton's face. The camera also allowed recording for such a long period necessary for the long takes of the movie that Lubezki went so far as to say the movie would have been impossible to do years before. The cameras were lensed with Leica Summilux-C or Zeiss Master Primes. Lubezki stated that these gave clean images, saying \"You can have all these lights in the frame and they are not really causing bad flare or things like that\". In terms of sizes, they initially trialled a 21mm, but this did not give I\u00f1\u00e1rritu the \"intimacy\" he wanted. The crew instead went to an 18mm Leica, which was used for the majority of the film. Only when emphasis was needed did they switch the lens to a 14mm, but this was rare.\nDespite all the preparation, a typical shooting day would begin with rehearsals. These usually lasted most of the morning, after which photography followed. The meticulous timing for the scenes meant that takes were cancelled because of the slightest mishaps. Emma Stone, in an interview with Jimmy Fallon, recalled how a six-minute take of the scene where Riggan first meets Mike was ruined after she walked around a corner too quickly. Takes were also repeated if a scene's rhythm did not feel right to I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, or if he and Lubezki were not satisfied with a shot's framing. As shooting progressed lines of dialog would also be dropped, giving I\u00f1\u00e1rritu more options during post-production. Because of this, the number of takes for a given scene was high, usually 20 for the shorter scenes, the takes running smoothly around the fifteenth. Chris Haarhoff described it as \"a type of dance where everyone would hopefully try to peak all at the same moment\". The locations sometimes placed restrictions on the takes too; the live Times Square sequence was shot only twice since they did not want to attract the attention of tourists.\nWhenever shooting was taking place there was pressure on everyone involved, but the cast had a positive experience. Norton said that normally in movie production half the people can \"check out\" due to repetitive aspects, but during the shooting of \"Birdman\", \"everybody's on, the whole thing, and you're all on pins and needles because you're all relying on forty other people not to drop the ball\". Because of this, Stone said the director was able to get the best out of the cast, saying I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's process \"creates this sort of fury in you, and then you end up realizing that he just got so much out of you that you didn't even know you had\". Naomi Watts commented that the atmosphere \"felt emblematic of how it feels onstageat least my long-time memories from long ago\". Andrea Riseborough, meanwhile, described the process as \"wonderful\", mentioning how it was possible to hear the filming of a sequence from far away before the camera arrived, and then \"the magic happens with you, and then everything leaves you, and everything's silent\". Once they successfully completed a take though, it was obvious to everybody involved. Norton said: \"I've never, ever been on a set where every day ended with an enormous, authentic sort of cheer at having made it. You're waiting for the scream from [I\u00f1\u00e1rritu], and everybody was genuinely excited.\"\nMusic and soundtrack.\nThe film's original music segments are a drum score consisting entirely of solo jazz percussion performances by Antonio S\u00e1nchez. The score is offset by a number of well known classical music pieces, including Mahler and Tchaikovsky. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu did not regard the particular choice of classical pieces as important. Nonetheless, the choice of classical music was strongly oriented to highly melodic scores taken predominantly from the 19th century classical repertoire (Mahler, Tchaikovsky, Rachmaninov, Ravel). I\u00f1\u00e1rritu stated that the classical components come from the world of the play, citing the radio in Riggan's room and the show itself as two sources of the music. The classical music segments also included two compositions by American composer John Adams. Several jazz compositions by Victor Hern\u00e1ndez Stumpfhauser and Joan Valent counterbalance the original music composition by S\u00e1nchez. The drum sections comprise the majority of the score, however, and were composed by S\u00e1nchez. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu explained the choice by saying they helped to structure scenes, and that \"The drums, for me, was a great way to find the rhythm of the film... In comedy, rhythm is king, and not having the tools of editing to determine time and space, I knew I needed something to help me find the internal rhythm of the film.\"\nI\u00f1\u00e1rritu contacted friend and jazz drummer Antonio S\u00e1nchez in January 2013, inviting him to compose the score for the film. His reaction to writing a soundtrack using only drums was similar to Lubezki's thoughts of shooting the movie like a single shot: \"It was a scary proposition because I had no point of reference of how to achieve this. There's no other movie I know that has a score like this.\" S\u00e1nchez had also not worked on a film before, nevertheless, after receiving the script, he composed \"rhythmic themes\" for each of the characters. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu was looking for the opposite approach, however, preferring spontaneity and improvisation. S\u00e1nchez then waited until production moved to New York before composing more, where he visited the set for a couple of days to get a better idea of the film. Following this, a week before principal photography, he and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu went to a studio to record some demos. During these sessions the director would first talk him through the scene, then while S\u00e1nchez was improvising guide him by raising his hand to indicate an event such as a character opening a door or by describing the rhythm with verbal sounds. They recorded around seventy demos, which I\u00f1\u00e1rritu used to inform the pacing of the scenes on set, and once filming was complete, spliced them into the rough cut. S\u00e1nchez summarized the process by saying, \"The movie fed on the drums, and the drums fed on the imagery\". The official soundtrack was released as a CD (77 min) in October 2014, and as an LP (69 min) in April 2015.\nWhen the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences released their longlist for the Academy Award for Best Original Score in December 2014, \"Birdman\" was absent from the list. The previous day, S\u00e1nchez received a note from the award committee explaining the decision, quoting rule fifteen of the 87th Academy Award Rules, noting \"the fact that the film also contains over a half an hour of non-original (mostly classical) music cues that are featured very prominently in numerous pivotal moments in the film made it difficult for the committee to accept your submission\". S\u00e1nchez launched an appeal, and along with I\u00f1\u00e1rritu and the executive vice-president of Fox Music, they sent letters to Charles Fox, the chair of the Academy's music branch executive committee, asking that the committee reconsider their decision. One of the points they raised was that the committee incorrectly calculated the ratio of classical to original music, which after being clarified S\u00e1nchez thought he was \"on really solid ground\". A response from Fox on December 19, however, explained that a special meeting of the music committee was held, and although its members had \"great respect\" for the score and considered it \"superb\", they thought that the classical music \"was also used as scoring\", \"equally contributes to the effectiveness of the film\", and that the musical identity of the film was created by both the drums and classical music. Ultimately, they did not overturn their decision. S\u00e1nchez said that he and I\u00f1\u00e1rritu were not satisfied with the explanation.\nPost-production and visual effects.\n\"Birdman\" was edited by Douglas Crise and Stephen Mirrione, who had both worked with the director before on \"21 Grams\" and \"Babel\". Stitching shots together was, of course, a crucial component of the editing, but Crise and Mirrione already had experience doing this. The director had included takes that were joined together in previous films, but in these if the editors didn't think the stitching worked they had the ability to introduce cuts. Mirrione said that in \"Birdman\" I\u00f1\u00e1rritu had \"let go of that safety net\". Because of this the editors needed to be involved in the project early on, and during principal photography Crise was on set every day. (Mirrione was busy and unable to be in New York.) Crise was not used to being on set and providing feedback, but said he was happy I\u00f1\u00e1rritu \"dragged it out\" of him, knowing that they wouldn't have much room to fix scenes later so they needed to get them right. For stitching, aside from the director, Crise also discussed strategies with Lubezki and Thompson, and techniques for gluing takes together included panning on walls and actors' bodies. The editors were used to being able to adjust the rhythm of a scene by the positioning of cuts, so without this tool used S\u00e1nchez's music instead. The director gave the New York recordings to Crise early on to help with pacing, asking him to cut the music to the film. Still, in terms of the editing workflow, Crise described it as \"pretty traditional\". The editors cut the film together back in Los Angeles. A few weeks after shooting, they were quite far along the cut itself, and transitioned into visual-effects mode, where they fine-tuned the shots.\nThe visual effects for the film were created by Montreal based studio Rodeo FX. They spent four months working on the film, and according to visual effects supervisor Ara Khanikian \"visual effects touched 90% of the frames in the movie\". A lot of the work was subtle. For example, stitching shots together, or creating the background for the windows in the hospital scene. Many shots in the film feature mirrors, and much work was spent removing the reflections of the crew from these. To accomplish this the studio created a 2.5D digital matte painting of the reflected environment. They then rotoscoped out the parts of the mirror not containing the foreground actors and their reflections, and replaced these with the digital environment. Some of the original shots captured smudges and dirt on the mirrors, so the studio developed a way to extract them so they could paste them back into the film. A matte-painting was constructed for the night-day time lapses in the film too, created by matchmoving and reprojecting shots of the buildings it features, captured at different times of the day, together. Rodeo FX also adjusted the pace of scenes. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu demanded a \"very precise rhythm and flow\" to the film, so the studio had to re-speed much of it with timewarp curves to fit the pacing the director desired.\nUnlike some of the smaller adjustments though, the flying sequence required extensive preparation. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu spent three weeks with Halon Entertainment to previsualize the sequence. In New York, Lubezki then used the choreography of the previsualization to shoot background plates for the sequence, using a camera crane on a truck. When these were shot, Lubezki had mounted four GoPro cameras to the lens of the film camera to capture the light environment around him. Later, on a greenstage in Montreal, using a technique he had developed on \"Gravity\", Lubezki lit Keaton with LED panels featuring high-dynamic-range images of the surrounding New York footage. The panels then realistically lit Keaton. Khanikian described the effect of the process, saying, \"Instead of using standard lighting on greenscreen, [we were getting] the proper red bounce from the red bricks, and the same color of the sky reflected on Michael's head. It worked so well.\" Rodeo FX then completed the final shots. The sequence was the last piece the editors inserted into the film. Mirrione commented that before the sequence was finished, they \"had only imagined what it was going to feel like\", but once it was completed, \"it took the movie to this ecstatic level that absolutely blew me away\".\nSound design for the film was handled by Mart\u00edn Hern\u00e1ndez, who has worked on all the director's feature films. The production sound his team was given was \"surprisingly perfect and clean\", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it. The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hern\u00e1ndez edited sound though. \"Normally, Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds'. The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on \"Birdman\" because here, everything is flowing.\" Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task, since the camera was nearly always moving. Hern\u00e1ndez also helped to cut S\u00e1nchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film. When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order \"to have distance, and closeness and resonance\" the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hern\u00e1ndez described the job as \"crazy\". A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers. Hern\u00e1ndez said he thought, for a film in general, that the narrative created by sound \"provokes more 'explosions'\" than that created by images, and that in \"Birdman\", \"Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film\".\nThe digital intermediate was completed by a team at Technicolor led by Steven Scott. They had previously collaborated with Lubezki on \"Gravity\", but needed to approach \"Birdman\" differently because of the continuous-shot approach. According to Scott, \"we have never done anything like it before\". The color timing had to be done in such a way that the transitions between color-corrected environments were invisible, in contrast to a usual film where the transitions coincide with visible cuts. To do this, the team inserted their own cuts whenever the camera was stationary, and in the middle of pans and other camera movements. They then devised a way to color correct the stationary cuts and turn the moving cuts into a form of dissolve, allowing them to \"do all these independent, crazy, complicated, color corrections that would flow organically from one to another\". Inserting the dissolves required rotoscoping methods which the software Scott and his team were using did not have, but an enterprise agreement between Technicolor and the software's developer led to the creation of a tool Scott required. For the color timing itself, one of the priorities of the team was making the faces as dimensional and readable as possible. This required, amongst other things, that faces be highlighted, but the moving camerawork meant that the mattes used in this process had to be animated by hand. Lubezki would provide notes on the areas he wanted tracked, then the team would carry out the animations. Of the whole process, I\u00f1\u00e1rritu remarked that \"everyone was out of their comfort zone\", while Scott said it was the most challenging DI project of his career.\nAnalysis and themes.\nThe director has emphasized and defended the various ambiguities intentionally included in the film: \"At the ending of the film, [it] can be interpreted as many ways as there are seats in the theater.\" Many aspects of film theory were debated concerning the film by critical reviews which included, among other subjects, (a) film genre; (b) intended and unresolved ambiguities of plot; and (c) the complex interaction of Riggan's personal life with his professional life as an actor. A short list of the diverse forms of film genre associated with the film has included it being referred to alternatively as a black-humor film, a mental health film, a realism/surrealism/magical realism film, a dark-humor parody film, a film of psychological realism, a failed domestic reconciliation drama, or a film concerning theatrical realism and naturalism. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu has maintained his penchant, well-known to followers of his previous films, for deliberately including multiple plot lines in this film which are intentionally left unresolved at the ending. Separate reviews in the press have also summarized the film as closely associated with the theme of the final tailspin of a late mid-life crisis in the life of a has-been actor seeking closure and resolution in his public and private life.\nThe father-daughter themes in the film, portrayed through the relationship of Riggan and Samantha, were the \"most difficult\" and important parts of the film to depict for co-writers Dinelaris and Giacobone, as they both had similar experiences within their families involving their own relationships with their daughters. When the writers were asked about the meaning of the ambiguous ending which the director refused to comment upon, they stated that any comedic ending was completely ruled out. The writers also stated that reflections about the conclusion to the film were not directly concentrated upon Riggan or the character of Birdman as much as upon the lives of the surviving characters portrayed in the film, in particular the portrayal of Riggan's daughter Samantha.\nNoting the thematic pull between Riggan's insanity or actual superpowers, Travis LaCouter of \"First Things\" writes that \"the importance of these powers real or imagined is apparent: They are for Riggan the thing beyond the labels, the kernel of his genius and, because he sees drawing upon them as selling out, the source of his great angst.\" LaCouter concludes that \"the quirky profundity of this film is in how it dares the viewer to consider the everyday magic that we tend to ignore, repress, or resent\".\nCritics Barbara Schweizerhof and Matthew Pejkovici see the film's central theme as a satirical critique of contemporary theatrical realism, with Pejkovici laudably comparing it to Fellini's film \"8\u00bd\" (1963). As Pejkovici states: \"Much like Fellini's 1960[sic] classic \"8\u00bd\", I\u00f1\u00e1rritu's \"Birdman\" is a very intimate film about an artist's malaise, yet is epic, innovative, and ambitious in approach. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu captures the artist's battle between ambition, admiration, and celebrity with stunning scope and skill in the form of a one-take format, as his camera sweeps through the backstage corridors, across the stage, out on the busy NYC streets, and back again in breathtaking fashion.\"\nThematically, Richard Brody also compared it to \"Opening Night\" (1977) by John Cassavetes. Brody said that the actors played in \"the sort of modern naturalism, without eccentricity of gesture, excess of expression, or heightened and formalistic precision, that is the business-casual of contemporary cinema\". \"The Wall Street Journal\"s Caryn James compared the story to that of \"Don Quixote\" (who believes himself to be a knight), as the main character believes he is a superhero (the equivalent to a knight in the 21st century). This relationship was also highlighted by the scholarly literature.\nRelease.\n\"Birdman\" was selected as the opening film of the 71st Venice International Film Festival along with Mohsen Makhmalbaf's new film. A limited release began in four North American theatres on October 17, 2014, followed by a nationwide release in 857 theatres on November 14, 2014.\nBox office.\n\"Birdman\" grossed $42.3 million in North America and $60.9 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $103.2 million, against a budget of about $17 million.\nThe film earned $424,397 during its limited North America opening in four theatres in New York and Los Angeles on the weekend of October 17, 2014, a per-theater average of $106,099, making it the 18th all-time earner (eighth among live-action movies) and ranking 20. In the second weekend of October 24, 2014, \"Birdman\" expanded to 50 theaters and earned $1.38 million, which translates to a $27,593 per-theater average. The film expanded nationwide to 857 theaters in the weekend of November 14, 2014, grossing $2,471,471, with a per theatre average of $2,884, and ranking 10. In the same weekend, \"Birdman\" grossed $11.6 million.\nThe film opened in Mexico on November 13, 2014, grossing $628,915 in its opening weekend, and opened in the United Kingdom on January 2, 2015, grossing $2,337,407 over the weekend. In the United Kingdom, Australia, and Italy, the film grossed $7.6 million, $3.97 million, and $1.97 million, respectively.\nCritical response.\nOn review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 91%, based on 351 reviews, and an average rating of 8.50/10. The website's critical consensus reads: \"A thrilling leap forward for director Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu, \"Birdman\" is an ambitious technical showcase powered by a layered story and outstanding performances from Michael Keaton and Edward Norton.\" On Metacritic, the film received a weighted average score of 87 out of 100, based on 58 critics, indicating \"universal acclaim\". Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"A\u2013\" on an A+ to F scale. In 2015, the film was named as one of the top 50 films of the decade so far by \"The Guardian\".\nMargaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from \"At the Movies\" praised the film's writing, direction, performances and cinematography. Stratton also described the implementation of the percussion score as \"really exciting\", while Pomeranz summarised: \"It's just really beautifully written and stunningly performed and beautifully made.\" The pair both gave the film five stars, making \"Birdman\" the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2014. In \"The New York Times\", Manohla Dargis compared the main character to Icarus, the Greek mythological figure who crashed to his death after flying too close to the sun. She also noted a reference to Susan Sontag's \"Against Interpretation\" in the dressing-room mirror.\nRichard Kolker compared the film to both Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rope\" (1948) and Alexander Sokurov's \"Russian Ark\" (2002). Kolker concludes that \"Birdman\" is \"a film about acting, identity, transformation, and the mysterious effects of superheroes, (and) is filmed to create the illusion of being made in one continuous take. As with \"Rope\", the edits are hidden, and the result is a rhythmic slide through the life of an actor in search of his self, a search doomed from the start.\" Ollie Cochran called the film \"an amalgam of technical prowess, hypnotising visuals and pragmatically perceptive dialogue\", believing it to be \"a thought-provoking, energetic perspective of a fading actor looking to revitalise his career.\"\nInternational reception of the film was also at a high level of praise. In Germany, a film aggregate rating at EPD Film gave the film a 3.4 out of 5 rating, based on seven critiques. The German critic Barbara Schweizerhof gave the film a 4 out of 5 possible stars, complimenting the director's satirical virtuosity in making the film. In her review, Schweizerhof spoke of the film as inviting the viewer to re-watch it \"a second and third time\", and praised the technical achievement of representing a storyline depicting \"the feverish stream of consciousness\" of its main character throughout the film.\nThe camerawork, which depicts most of the film as one continuous take, was met with extensive acclaim for its execution and usage. The acting was widely praised, particularly Keaton's, with Peter Debruge of \"Variety\" calling the performance the \"comeback of the century\". Debruge described the film as \"a self-aware showbiz satire\", and called it \"a triumph on every creative level\". Robbie Collin of \"The Daily Telegraph\" rated the film 5/5 and gave particular praise to the use of long takes by Emmanuel Lubezki, director of photography. Richard Roeper gave the film an \"A\" and wrote that Keaton made a serious case for an Academy Award for Best Actor nomination (which Keaton later achieved).\nWriting for \"The New Yorker\", Richard Brody called the film \"Godardian\", comparing it to \"Pierrot le Fou\" (1965), \"Every Man for Himself\" (1980), \"Alphaville\" (1965), and \"Germany Year 90 Nine Zero\" (1991), four classic films by French director Jean-Luc Godard. However, he suggested the film fell short of reaching the same cinematic mastery, adding, \"it's not a good idea for a filmmaker to get in the ring with Mr. Godard\". In his critical comments on the film, he concluded that the film \"trade[d] on facile, casual dichotomies of theatre versus cinema and art versus commerce\" and \"deliver[ed] a work of utterly familiar and unoriginal drama\". In another review in \"The New Yorker\" separately supplementing the review by Brody, Anthony Lane rejected the film's suggestion that film critics are out to destroy films, explaining, \"Someone could have told I\u00f1\u00e1rritu that critics, though often mean, are not preemptively so, and that anybody who'd say, as Tabitha does, 'I'm going to destroy your play', before actually seeing it, would not stay long in the job.\"\nSome reviews were negative. Richard Lawson of \"Vanity Fair\", called the film \"hoary\" and \"deceptively simple\". Scott Tobias, writing for The Dissolve, gave the film 1.5 stars. He commends Lubezki's cinematography as succeeding at \"trapping viewers in a pressure-cooker atmosphere as Riggan and his players struggle to keep it together\", but suggests that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu is \"incapable of modulation\", and that there exists \"a sourness to \"Birdman\" that I\u00f1\u00e1rritu can't turn into wit\".\nAccolades.\nAt the 87th Academy Awards, \"Birdman\" won four Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Cinematography. Michael Keaton was nominated for Best Actor, Edward Norton and Emma Stone were nominated in Best Supporting Acting categories, and it also received nominations for Sound Editing and Sound Mixing.\nKeaton received his first Golden Globe Award, winning for Best Actor in a Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy at the 72nd Golden Globe Awards. The film also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay.\nTop ten lists.\n\"Birdman\" was listed on many critics' top ten lists."}
{"title": "Anniyan", "label": "Film", "text": "Anniyan () is a 2005 Indian Tamil-language psychological action thriller film written and directed by S. Shankar and produced by V. Ravichandran of Aascar Films. The plot centres on a disillusioned everyman whose frustration at what he sees as increasing social apathy and public negligence leads to a split personality that attempts to improve the system. Vikram stars as Ambi, an idealistic, law-abiding lawyer who has Dissociative identity disorder (formerly known as Multiple personality disorder) and develops two other identities: a metrosexual fashion model named Remo, and a murderous vigilante named Anniyan and Sadha plays his love interest, Nandini. Actors Vivek, Nedumudi Venu, Nassar and Prakash Raj also feature.\nShankar conceived the film in mid-2003 during the post-production period of his previous film, \"Boys\". He based the film on his own life experiences during his formative years when he was disturbed by what he saw around him, and his eventual displeasure with the society. Pre-production for \"Anniyan\" began in November 2003 and principal photography in March 2004. The making of the film, which included numerous production delays, took 14 months. The film was shot at Hyderabad, Thanjavur, Tindivanam and Chennai, and the song sequences were filmed in Mumbai, Malaysia, Amsterdam and Tenkasi. The film was notable for its recreation of the \"Tyagaraja Aradhana\" music festival and the extensive use of time slice photography in an action sequence.\nCinematographer V. Manikandan abandoned the project halfway through, until he was replaced with Ravi Varman. The technical departments were headed by V. T. Vijayan (editing), Sabu Cyril (production design), and Peter Hein (stunt choreography), and the soundtrack was composed by Harris Jayaraj, who was in his first collaboration with the director. The film was touted as the director's \"magnum opus\" and was budgeted at 263.8 million, making it at the time of its release the most expensive South Indian film ever made. Notably, it was the first South Indian film to obtain institutional finance, and it had the highest insurance coverage available for films at that time.\nOriginally filmed in Tamil, and released simultaneously in the four South Indian states on 10 June 2005, the film was dubbed into Telugu as \"Aparichithudu\" and in Hindi as \"Aparichit The Stranger\" was released a year later on 19 May 2006. Further, the film was also dubbed into French and released in French-speaking countries worldwide by Columbia Tristar. While the film was a commercial success across South India, the Hindi version received a lukewarm response and was a box-office failure. \"Anniyan\" received positive responses from critics grossed 570 million in its lifetime run. In addition to winning a record breaking eight Filmfare Awards and six State Film Awards, the film also won a National Award in the Special Effects category.\nPlot.\nRamanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is a straightforward consumer protection advocate from Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone to follow the law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidences always seem to favour the accused. His efforts to raise civic awareness go in vain due to pervasive corruption and a general lack of seriousness. Frustrated at his inability to bring about a change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed vigilante who murders corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers in it and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.\nAmbi is secretly in love with his neighbour Nandini, a medical student and an aspiring Carnatic singer, but never expresses his feelings due to fear of rejection. When he does get the courage to do so during the annual Tyagaraja Aradhana with the help of his friend, Sub-inspector Chari, she rejects him as she cannot bear his overbearing nature and constant complaining and nitpicking. Distraught, Ambi attempts suicide, almost drowning himself before having second thoughts. Subsequently, he develops another personality named Remo, a metrosexual fashion model. Nandini is smitten by Remo and falls in love with him, unaware that Remo is one of Ambi's split personalities. Their marriage is eventually fixed.\nWhile purchasing a plot of land for her dowry, Nandini decides to undervalue the property to evade stamp duty. Ambi, who accompanies her to the government office, refuses to help her on learning of her intention to skirt the law. Later, when Nandini and Remo are on a date, Remo transforms into Anniyan and attempts to punish her for her corrupt act. As he is about to kill her, Nandini calls out for Ambi. Anniyan then reverts to Ambi, who collapses and loses consciousness. Nandini takes Ambi to National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS) where he is diagnosed with multiple personality disorder. Through recovered-memory therapy, Vijaykumar, the chief psychiatrist of NIMHANS, uncovers Ambi's past. It is revealed that when Ambi was ten years old, he witnessed the accidental death of his younger sister Vidya due to civic apathy. The incident left a deep emotional scar, which is the reason for his lofty ideals. It is also discovered that while Anniyan and Remo are aware of Ambi as a separate person, Ambi is oblivious to their existence within him. Vijaykumar declares that Remo will cease to exist if Nandini reciprocates Ambi's feelings, but Anniyan will cease to exist only when the society reforms. Nandini accepts Ambi's love and Remo disappears.\nMeanwhile, DCP Prabhakar and Chari investigate the murders committed by Anniyan. In disguises, they discover clues left behind by Anniyan, which are the names of the punishments he meted out to his victims. Prabhakar is personally determined to punish Anniyan, as one of his victims, Chockalingam, an errant catering contractor with the Indian Railways, was his elder brother. In a dramatic publicity stunt, Anniyan admits to the murders he committed when he appears amidst the public and the press at the Nehru Stadium. He explains the rationale behind them and says that only when every Indian is responsible and sincere will the country prosper on par with developed nations. His methods draw both praise and criticism. Prabhakar tries to catch Anniyan, but he escapes.\nOn investigating the phone records and IP address of Anniyan's internet activity, Prabhakar discovers that the connection belongs to Ambi. Upon further analysis of a security footage of Anniyan's public appearance, Ambi's face is revealed under the hood. Prabhakar arrests Ambi and subjects him to a polygraph test to make him confess to his crimes. The officers see that he is telling the truth and is oblivious to killing anyone, believing his innocence. Prabhakar, enraged and not having any of it, orders all the officers and Chari to leave, and begins brutally attacking and tormenting Ambi with Garuda Puranam punishments. Ambi is eventually thrown into a boiling hot salt water tank by Prabhakar. When a traumatised Ambi begs for mercy, Prabhakaran mockingly turns on the water cooler, making the water extremely cold to the point it becomes ice so that Ambi will freeze to death.\nThe near-death experience and pain triggers Anniyan's reappearance. Ambi's personality alternates between Ambi and Anniyan; he brutally subdues Prabhakar as Anniyan, while begging for mercy as Ambi. Later, when Ambi is tried for several murders, Vijaykumar testifies to Ambi's mental condition. Chari also had secretly recorded Ambi's interrogation and torture at Prabhakar's hands and presents it as evidence of Ambi's mental condition. Ambi is acquitted, but is directed to undergo psychotherapy in a mental hospital and will be eligible for release when cured.\nWhen Ambi is released two years later, his rigid adherence to protocol has diminished and he appears more open and accommodating. He marries Nandini. While travelling on a train during their trip, Ambi notices a man (an electrician who was indirectly responsible for his sister's death several years ago) drinking amidst fellow passengers. Suffering a relapse, he transforms into Anniyan and throws the man off the train, killing him. However, he hides the incident from Nandini, indicating that he has successfully blended his personalities into one instead of eradicating them.\nProduction.\nPre-production.\nDuring the making of his Bollywood directorial debut \"Nayak\" in early 2001, director S. Shankar had conceived a science fiction film titled \"Robot\". A futuristic techno-thriller set in the 22nd century Chennai, the film was to star Kamal Haasan and Preity Zinta. However, after completing a photo-shoot featuring the two, the production was shelved due to various reasons, including Haasan's unavailability of dates and creative differences with the director. Shankar postponed the project indefinitely and made the coming of age film, \"Boys\" (2003). When the post-production work of \"Boys\" was underway, Shankar was awaiting the return of its composer A. R. Rahman, who was then outside India, to complete the background score. In the meantime, Shankar had an idea for a storyline and called Vikram, who expressed enthusiasm for the subject.\nDevelopment.\nFollowing the release of \"Boys\" in August 2003, Shankar began work on his next directorial venture entitled \"Anniyan\". It was initially thought to be Shankar's pet project \"Robot\" revived with a new title, but this was later proven not to be correct. Shankar said the film was his \"dream project\" and disclosed that it would be a racy, fantasy-thriller. When questioned on how the idea behind the film had come to him, the director revealed, \"The seeds of all my movies were sown when I was young, long before I started making movies. So many things disturbed me, and these stayed with me. Those were the seeds. I make films based on them.\"\nWith the highest production value among Tamil films of its time, the film was touted to be the director's \"magnum opus\" and was labelled \"the most eagerly awaited film of the year\" by the media. The film deals with a person having dissociative identity disorder, commonly known as \"multiple personality disorder\" (MPD) or \"split personality syndrome\". It was compared to \"Chandramukhi\", released two months before, as it also focused on a character with the same syndrome.\nCasting.\nTo portray the lead character, Shankar needed a performer who could play an action hero. He chose Vikram as he felt that the actor, in addition to being a performer, had the image of an action hero. While his casting was made public in a November 2003 news report announcing the project's inception, the director revealed that Vikram was added to the cast in mid-2003 and refuted theories that the actor's casting was to capitalise on his new-found popularity following his success at the National Film Awards, where he won the National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film \"Pithamagan\" (2003). Stating that Vikram was selected for the lead role months before the theatrical release of \"Pithamagan\", Shankar added, \"I don't look at actors that way.\" He further remarked that Vikram was the \"life and soul\" of \"Anniyan\".\nThe heroine role of a \"devoted Iyengar Brahmin girl\" was originally offered to Aishwarya Rai Bachchan, who was too busy to accommodate production dates. After months of waiting for her call sheet, Shankar eventually offered the role to Sadha. Expressing hope that it would be \"an important movie\" in her career, Sadha accepted the offer, working on the film for 120 days, adding, \"I have a major role to play in \"Anniyan\". There are few heavy portions involving me in the movie that I have given my best.\" She considered being a part of a Shankar film, especially during the early stages of her career, as a \"god's gift\" and a \"once-in-a-lifetime experience\". However, when offered similar roles following the film's success, she refused to be typecast and stated, \"I am now looking for roles where my creative potential is tapped. I don't want to be part of such cinema where all one has to do is dance around trees.\"\nVivek, Prakash Raj, Nedumudi Venu and Nassar appear in supporting roles. Mohan Vaidhya, a carnatic vocalist and occasional actor, plays a minuscule role as Sadha's father Krishna. Malavika Avinash was approached to play Vikram's mother; she rejected the offer, stating, \"I am too young to do a screen mom and too old to be a heroine!\" Cochin Haneefa, Charle, Kalabhavan Mani, Shanmugarajan and Saurabh Shukla make cameo appearances as delinquent citizens. Haneefa played an indifferent car owner who refuses to help an accident victim as he does not want his \"brand new car\" to be soiled with blood. Following Haneefa's death in February 2010, Vikram recalled the actor's appearance in the film and said, \"Though he'd come only in a few scenes no one could miss him. For roles that have some ambiguity about whether it's a good guy or a bad guy, he is one of the best choices. Until the end, one cannot really guess if he'll end up being good or bad.\" Comedian and character artiste Charle played an unnamed wastrel and alcoholic who extorts money from his ageing parents for his expenses and is considered by Anniyan to be a liability to society. Charle was instructed by Shankar, \"People should see only the character. Only later should they realise that it was Charle.\"\nThe role of the younger Ambi was played by child actor Hari Prashanth alias Viraj. When he came to the recording studio to voice his lines, he was accompanied by his father S. N. Surendar, a singer and dubbing artiste. Shankar recognised Surendar and asked him to lend his voice for Nedumudi Venu as the latter was a Malayali. In the 2004 comedy film \"Aethirree\", which featured Sadha in the female lead, Kanika played the second lead role of a \"naughty\" Brahmin girl. Shankar, apparently impressed with Kanika's performance in the film, asked her to attend a voice test. When the film-makers preferred Kanika's accent and modulation among the thirty females whose voices were tested, she was selected to dub for Sadha's Brahmin role.\nTechnical crew.\nThe film was produced by V. Ravichandran under his own film production and distribution company 'Oscar Films' (presently 'Aascar Films'). The screenplay was written by Shankar and the film had dialogue written by writer Sujatha. Shankar retained Sabu Cyril, his production designer from \"Boys\", to handle the set design; the scenes were edited by V. T. Vijayan. While the action sequences were orchestrated by Peter Hein and assisted by Stunt Silva, the dance sequences were choreographed by Raju Sundaram, Kalyan and Ahmed Khan. Film institute student Prabhu Raja Chozhan, who would later turn director with \"Karuppampatti\" (2013), joined Shankar as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 and worked as his assistant.\nShankar, who grew up admiring the works of cinematographer P. C. Sreeram in films like \"Nayakan\" (1987), \"Agni Natchathiram\" (1988) and \"Idhayathai Thirudathe\" (1989), desired to collaborate and was in talks with him to handle the photography. While Sreeram was intent on working in \"Anniyan\", he could not accept the offer due to prior commitments. It was initially reported in the media that Sreeram had been recruited; however, Shankar chose V. Manikandan as the director of photography, impressed with his work in \"Main Hoon Na\" (2004). Manikandan had earlier collaborated with Shankar when he shot the music video of the song \"Secret of Success\" in \"Boys\". Manikandan gave six months of bulk dates for the project; but, when the production was troubled by delays, Shankar demanded three more months to complete the film. Manikandan walked out in October 2004 citing scheduling conflicts and Shankar replaced him with Ravi Varman.\nDuring the casting stage of \"Boys\", the film's cinematographer Ravi K. Chandran was temporarily unavailable and his then-assistant Ravi Varman handled the camera to film Genelia D'Souza's makeup test. Subsequently, Varman nurtured a desire to work with Shankar. Before Shankar commenced work on \"Anniyan\", Varman expressed his desire to work in the film and was hopeful of landing the assignment. He was disappointed when Shankar recruited Manikandan for the project. However, when Manikandan abandoned the project after completing almost half the film, Shankar asked Varman to shoot the remaining portions of the film. Varman had committed to work in Bengali director Buddhadeb Dasgupta's next film, work on which was scheduled to begin shortly; he dropped out of it to accept Shankar's offer and termed working in \"Anniyan\" \"a dream come true\".\nPreparation and character looks.\nVikram allotted 18 months and 190 days of his call sheet for the film, including 165 days of bulk dates spread across six months. Speaking on the extent of his involvement in the filmmaking process, Vikram said, \"Before beginning the film, I was totally involved in the research and preparation, but once on the sets, I go by what the director says.\" He further clarified that he discussed every shot with Shankar, went for re-takes where necessary to make the scenes better, and gave suggestions, but left the \"ultimate verdict\" to the director. Disclosing that, among the three shades to his character, he found playing Ambi to be the toughest, he reasoned, \"Because as a hero you are not used to being a wimp on screen. It's difficult digesting getting beaten up.\" In contrast, being a graduate in English literature, he found playing Remo much easier and more in his comfort zone.\nIn an interview with \"Gulf News\", Vikram spoke of the challenges in portraying all three characters while wearing the same costumes. He said, \"I love such challenges. [...] Although the costume defined each of the three characters in \"Anniyan\", there were scenes where Ambi would suddenly become Remo and Remo would become Anniyan. There I made it dramatic to bring out each character.\" He credited his wife Shailaja Balakrishnan, a psychologist, for helping him in fleshing out the character of Ambi, a person who has multiple personality disorder. In a conversation with film critic Baradwaj Rangan, Shailaja recalled the times the film was being made and spoke of Vikram, saying, \"I felt we should live in two houses. It's not easy to live with a man who can get that eccentric, an actor who wants to be that difficult on himself. I wouldn't say he becomes the character, but there's definitely some kind of internalisation.\" Vikram confessed that he had a tough time during the film's making as playing different characters affected him and he found himself going mad. He added that he would take a break after a 15-day shoot and watch the pigeons on his terrace as a way of dealing with the pressure.\nVikram grew a tummy to portray Ramanujam while he sported a \"macho look\" for Anniyan. He also grew his hair long in preparation for his role and rejected other film offers to maintain the continuity in his looks. Together with his character looks and those that he sported in the song sequences, Vikram appears in the film in 18 different getups. Vikram's look in the film was created by make-up artiste Banu. For those parts that show him as metrosexual Remo, he coloured his hair in streaks of copper and blonde. Unwilling to reveal his 'new look' until the film was ready, Vikram avoided the media despite winning the aforementioned National Award for the year 2003. Meanwhile, Sadha's make-up and hair styling were done by Mumbai-based celebrity stylist Ojas M. Rajani.\nFilming.\nThe film was officially launched with a traditional \"puja\" and muhurat shot on 4 March 2004 at AVM Studios, Chennai. The studio was decorated with life-sized stills showing Vikram in three distinct looks, \"a voodoo hunter, a pious 'sami' and a bubbling youth\"; this led the media to speculate that Vikram would be playing either a triple role or a character with three shades. The film's caption was 'He who comes from hell is not afraid of hot ashes'. During the launch function, Shankar expressed hope of completing the film in six months and releasing the film on 12 November 2004, coinciding with the Diwali festival. However, the production, which began shortly afterwards in May 2004, was marred by several delays and took 14 months to complete. The film was shot in Amsterdam, Malaysia, Mumbai, Hyderabad, Tenkasi, Thanjavur, Villupuram and Chennai.\nThe film features a scene at the \"Thiruvaiyaru Thyagaraja Utsavam\". The \"Utsavam\" is a week-long music festival which commemorates the 18th-century saint-composer Tyagaraja, revered as one of the greatest composers of carnatic music, and is held annually at his resting place in Thiruvaiyaru, Thanjavur. With the use of sets, the art department recreated the \"Tyagaraja Aradhana\" near Mahabalipuram in Tamil Nadu. For filming the scene, the crew recreated a performance of the famous kriti \"Jagad\u0101nanda k\u0101rak\u0101\", the first of the five Pancharatna Kriti compositions of Tyagaraja, as performed during \"Tyagaraja Aradhana\". The \"aradhana\", held on the fifth day of the festival, witnesses exponents of carnatic music from across the world converging at his \"samaadhi\", where they sing his pancharatna kritis in unison as an homage to the saint.\nShankar approached violin maestro Kunnakudi Vaidyanathan, a regular participant at the actual event, to conceive and orchestrate the sequence. Vaidyanathan was serving as the secretary of Sri Thyagabrahma Mahotsava Sabha, the committee which organises the \"aradhana\". The scene features him in a cameo and was shot in June 2004 at a studio in Chennai. Realistic sets were erected to resemble the actual venue and leading carnatic vocalists Sudha Ragunathan, Sirkazhi G. Sivachidambaram, O. S. Arun, P. Unni Krishnan and instrumentalists such as violinist A. Kanyakumari, mridangam exponent Umayalpuram K. Sivaraman were recruited to add a touch of authenticity. The two-minute scene was brought to life in \"painstaking detail\". The sequence was much talked about and well appreciated.\nIn a fight sequence, Anniyan encounters about a hundred martial artists inside the fictional International Martial Arts School, Vodao. The stunt scene was shot at the JJ Indoor Stadium in Chennai over a period of 25 days. Peter Hein, the stunt choreographer, is a native of Vietnam. 127 professionally trained fighters were brought in from Vietnam for the shoot. During the rehearsals, the rope, to which the stuntmen were tied and hung upside down, gave in. About a dozen stuntmen crashed down from the balcony, injuring themselves badly. The action sequence was shot using 120 cameras for employing the time slice photography technique, a visual effect known as \"bullet time\" and popularised by the American film \"The Matrix\" (1999), to achieve the frozen-time effect. Shankar had earlier toyed with the idea of time-slice and tried it while filming the song \"Ale Ale\" in his \"Boys\". While the time-freeze sequence in \"Boys\" was achieved by the linking of 60\u201362 cameras to attain a 180\u00b0 rotation, \"Anniyan\" employed 120\u2013122 cameras for a 270\u00b0 rotation.\nThe scene where Anniyan addresses a huge gathering was shot in a stadium in Hyderabad. As he speaks to the audience, the lights turn on and off in the background. Speaking on how the sequence was filmed, Ravi Varman said that they decided not to light up the entire stadium as they felt it would have looked flat. As the sequence was important to the film, he juxtaposed the stadium with light and shadow so that it would look different. During the pre-climax scene, when Ambi is held custody and enquired by Prabhakar, Ambi's persona keeps switching between the characters Ambi and Anniyan. Dubbed the \"chameleon act\" in the media, Vikram claims to have completed the sequence in a single take.\nAn action sequence was filmed in a set erected in Campa Cola grounds, Chennai. For the scene where Remo courts Nandini, a chemical tube brought from Malaysia was used to measure how attractive a person is. For filming scenes based on the punishments, buffaloes and snakes were transported in hundreds exclusively from Vellore and the sequence was shot for about three days. The \"Anthakoopam\" punishment sequence featuring the buffaloes was filmed in a set erected in Chennai's Prasad Studios. The animals were transported in 15 lorries containing 20 buffaloes each. For the scene where Charle's character is killed by Anniyan, the studio was filled with snake charmers who were brought in to handle the large number of snakes.\nSong sequences.\nThe semi-classical song \"Kumari\" was the first of the scenes to be shot. Filmed at the World Flower Show in May 2004, the sequence was picturised in a large tulip garden located in the city of Vijfhuizen near Amsterdam, Netherlands. The song was shot during the Netherlands International Flower Show called Floriade, a decennial event which was held between 10 April and 20 October 2004. While the crew had planned to film another song at a garden in Keukenhof, they were denied permission by the authorities as a previous Indian film crew had damaged the habitat a few weeks before.\nThe song features the lead pair singing amidst a flower farm as mridangam and flute players accompany them in the background. It was choreographed by Raju Sundaram who also appears in a cameo, playing a harmonium. As part of their roles, the male supporting actors who appear in the song were required to wear a \"panjakkacham\" and \"angavastram\", leaving most of their body exposed to the freezing cold. The shoot began as early as 5:30 AM and the locals, who thought they should be out of their mind to be dressed so, came up to them and warned that they might freeze to death.\n\"Iyengaru Veetu\", a semi-classical song, begins with a prelude of the Pancharatna Kriti \"Jagad\u0101nanda k\u0101rak\u0101\". The actual song which follows later was picturised on a set erected at AVM Studios made to look like an old traditional Iyengar home in Thanjavur. The song was shot extravagantly with the lead pair and the dozens of support dancers sporting rich, colourful costumes.\nIn December 2004, a ten-day shoot was held in Mumbai for the item number \"Kadhal Yaanai\" featuring Vikram alongside a top model, whose identity was initially undisclosed to generate curiosity. It was later revealed to be Czech-based model Yana Gupta. Filmed by Ravi Varman and choreographed by Ahmed Khan, the song was filmed like a fashion show where Vikram and Yana Gupta wear fashionable clothes and sashay along a ramp. The song was filmed in a set erected in a studio to resemble a famous night-spot in London.\nThe track \"Kannum Kannum Nokia\", a peppy and trendy love duet choreographed by Raju Sundaram, was picturised on the lead pair and had them wearing costumes made entirely of designer labels. The song was picturised in Malaysia at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport and Petronas Towers. The song, filmed during the night, was reportedly the first song to be shot at the airport. Ravi Varman revealed in an interview that the song was shot like a commercial. The song was also filmed at the Nokia Headquarters in Espoo, Finland.\nThe folk song \"Andangkaaka\" was shot in a village near Sengottai. For filming the song, a huge set was erected to resemble a village. The sets were visualised and created by Sabu Cyril, the film's art director. Shankar adopted a village near Tenkasi and Sabu Cyril painted all the houses, roads, rocks and even a bridge in varied colours. They then hired hundreds of lorries and old model ambassador cars and painted faces on them. The lead pair were joined by hundreds of dancers and the total cost of the song worked out to 10 million. In all, 350 houses were painted.\nPost-production.\nIn the narrative, Ambi is referred to the website, codice_1. Shankar envisioned that the website would take visitors through all the punishments that await sinners in hell. For designing the website, Shankar wanted to recreate hell and approached the Visual Computing Labs (VCL) of Tata Elxsi, a Mumbai-based company with which he had collaborated earlier for the song \"Girlfriend\" in \"Boys\". The team at VCL conceptualised and created a 'hell' in 3d animation with the punishments taken from ancient scriptures. They also designed a grim reaper astride his bull who guides visitors through hell. Pankaj Khandpur, creative director of VCL said, \"We tried to stay true to the scriptures, while creating imagery that wasn't too gory. [...] an interesting project since we had to visualise it all without any reference point.\" The animation was done in a span of three months.\nVCL also did the CGI for a \"cosmic zoom\" scene, where the camera zooms from beyond the clouds to the streets of Chennai city, which no real camera can achieve. Aerial views and paintings of the city were stitched together along with computer generated images (CGI) of clouds to create the long, one-piece camera zoom. Animator and special effects designer L. I. Kannan, who would later turn director with the long-delayed period film \"Karikalan\" with Vikram in the lead, also worked on the special effects. Meanwhile, the special effects for the time-slice sequence were rendered by Big Freeze in London.\nThe scene where Anniyan addresses a packed audience in Nehru Stadium was filmed with the space empty. The crowd was created through visual effects using crowd multiplication methods. The VFX for the sequence was done under the supervision of visual effects consultant Zameer Hussain of Land Marvel Animation Studios, Chennai. The scene, in which hundreds of buffaloes chase down a delinquent car owner into an abandoned sand quarry and trample him to death, was accomplished through CGI using just one buffalo. The CG work, was supplied by Jayakumar and V. Srinivas Mohan of the Chennai-based firm, Indian Artists Computer Graphics. Srinivas and his team had earlier worked with Shankar in \"Boys\". Speaking of the sequence, Srinivas quipped, \"The animals are lethargic and listless in their movements. Nothing can make them agile.\"\nThemes and influences.\nThe storyline in \"Anniyan\" is typical of Shankar's yen for showcasing society's ills and targets the inept, rules-flouting public. The film sheds light on the increasing social apathy and public negligence, and attempts to address these issues which plague the society and hamper the development of India. S. Anand of \"Outlook\" noted that most of Shankar's films portray the hero as a \"one-man agent of change\" and cited, \"From the neo-Nazi character Kamal Haasan plays in \"Indian\" to his last film \"Anniyan\", featuring a schizophrenic Brahmin serial killer who butchers 'wrongdoers', Shankar has always offered fascist-fantastic solutions to what he perceives as social ills resulting from typical governmental inertia.\"\nIn an interview with \"The Hindu\", Shankar elaborated on the message he conveys through the film:\nFollowing the release of the trailer on 7 May 2005, the film was believed to be inspired by the 1886 Robert Louis Stevenson novel, \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\". Upon the film's release, \"The Hindu\" drew parallels between it and the 1998 novel \"Tell Me Your Dreams\" by Sidney Sheldon. Shankar denied that the film was inspired by \"Tell Me Your Dreams\", claiming that he knew of the novel only after completing the script. Sify compared the character of Ambi to the protagonist of \"The Mask\" (1994), a film about a \"mild mannered guy changing into a one-man army, craving to see natural justice realised\".\nThe methods of punishment meted out to the sinners by Anniyan in the film is based on Garuda Purana, a Vaishnavite \"purana\" which speaks of life after death and punishments for wrongdoers. Shankar pointed out that he \"worked tirelessly day and night and intense research was done with the help of a professor in department of Vaishnavism in Madras University.\"\nMusic.\nThe album marked Shankar's first collaboration with Harris Jayaraj; all his previous directorial ventures had A. R. Rahman composing the music. As Rahman was busy with his debut Broadway musical Bombay Dreams and had also signed up for another musical Lord of the Rings, Rahman and Shankar decided to part ways. In early 2004, Harris Jayaraj went on a trip to Phuket Islands in Thailand for some inspiration for the album; he was accompanied by Shankar and Vairamuthu. Eventually, the three songs penned by the lyricist were composed in the island. The visit took place much before the tragic 2004 tsunami struck the countries bordering the Indian Ocean and wreaked havoc. In a chat with Shankar, Harris Jayaraj said \"the music was a challenge because the film was a mix of genres\u00a0\u2013 action, comedy, thriller. In essence, it was a cock-mocktail ..\" Harris Jayaraj commenced the film's re-recording in April 2005 and took more than a month to complete, delaying the film's release. The soundtrack album features six tracks, including a theme music; the lyrics for the songs were written by Vairamuthu, Na. Muthukumar and Kabilan. The album was released as a soft launch on 13 May 2005.\nRelease.\nThe film cleared the censors without any cuts and was rated \"U\" (Universal) by the Central Board of Film Certification. While Shankar had hoped to release the film on Diwali 2004, there were numerous production delays which postponed the release date through early 2005. While production was completed in March 2005, the re-recording which began in April took more time than anticipated lasting nearly 45 days with Harris Jayaraj being blamed for further delays. After the film was postponed from 20 May 2005, and later, from 27 May 2005, the film was finally scheduled for 10 June 2005. But, Shankar released it a week later on 17 June 2005 as he considered 8 as his lucky number (1+7 yielding 8).\nThe film was dubbed into other South Indian languages and was released simultaneously in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. The film was also released in key overseas countries like the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Malaysia and Singapore. The film was released with 404 prints in Tamil and Telugu alone. Later, the film was dubbed into French by Paramount Pictures. Reportedly, \"Anniyan\" is the first Indian film to be dubbed into French and released in French-speaking countries worldwide by Columbia Tristar. The film was further dubbed and released in Hindi as \"Aparichit: The Stranger\" on 19 May 2006. It is the first film featuring Vikram in the lead to have a theatrical release in Hindi. At a private screening held a day before its Hindi theatrical release, the film received a \"warm reception\".\nReception.\nThe film received highly positive reviews from critics. Malathi Rangarajan of \"The Hindu\" said that the film works as it melds an interesting screen line with racy action. She also noted that the story resembled Shankar's \"Indian\" (1996) a lot while also bearing semblance to his \"Gentleman\" (1993). She remarked that the story and screenplay deserved to be lauded for its \"ingenious sparks in narration\" but problems arose with respect to its plausibility. She then declared, \" [...] some of the best camera shots, stunts and locations on a mind-boggling scale have been showcased. If you enjoy magnificence in cinema you will like this \"Anniyan\".\" Krishnakumar wrote for Rediff.com that learning from the debacle of \"Boys\", the director went back to his strength by taking a social theme, spicing it up and serving the perfect commercial fare. He added that in trying to explain multiple personality disorder in the simplest of terms, the director has only succeeded to a certain extent as a majority of viewers who are not that well informed might not even comprehend what is being said. Labelling the film as a \"must see\", a reviewer at Sify acclaimed that the film holds the viewers riveted with its racy narration, a relevant message backed with technical wizardry, never-seen before colourful song picturisation and particularly the performance of Vikram. Yet, the reviewer criticised that the film was too lengthy and the story too thin on logic.\nReviewing \"Aparichithudu\", the Telugu version of the film, \"The Hindu\" said that it was watchable. Regarding the Hindi version of the film, Raja Sen of Rediff.com derided the pathetic dubbing though saying that it was refreshing and watchable, despite boasting of enough masala to make the viewers sneeze. He concluded his review by saying, \"Overall, \"Aparichit\" is a slickly made, well-paced actioner that works quite well, despite the dub. The film is engaging and crisply scripted, and the action is never too excessive, lightened by jokes and general tomfoolery that never offensively interrupts the actual plot.\"\nAwards.\nFollowing the commercial success of the Telugu version \"Aparichitudu\", which was a runaway hit in Andhra Pradesh, Shankar was felicitated by Sri Venkateswara Social and Cultural Organisation (SVESCO) of Tirupati and was conferred the title 'Darsaka Brahma'. In a conversation with athlete Shiny Wilson, actor Jayaram remarked, \"\"Anniyan\" was a runaway hit in Kerala. But if a Malayalam star had tried out an \"Anniyan\"-kind of role with a weird hairdo, it would have been a disaster!\"\nThe film received numerous awards and nominations. The film won National Award in the Special Effects category. \"Anniyan\" became the fourth film directed by Shankar to receive that award; the other three are \"Kadhalan\" (1994), \"Indian\" (1996) and \"Jeans\" (1998). It also won eight out of the total 15 awards awarded by Filmfare for the best of Tamil cinema.\nEconomics.\nPre-release.\nBy the time the production was nearing completion, the trade sources had estimated the film to cost around 120\u2013150 million; but, as often happens with films directed by Shankar, the budget was overshot. Made at a cost of 263.8 million, \"Anniyan\" was touted as the most expensive South Indian film to be ever made during the time of its release.\nIndiaGlitz estimates that the total production cost, excluding the remuneration cost of the cast and technicians, is 90 million. It was the first Tamil film and the first in South India to get institutional finance. For its institutional finance, it procured a sum of 95 million from IDBI Bank. \"Anniyan\" was insured by United India Insurance for 150 million, thereby making it the first south Indian film to be insured and also the largest insurance cover extended to a south Indian film at that time.\nDistribution.\nWith the amount of hype the film generated in the media, theatre owners eagerly came forward and offered hefty prices as Minimum Guarantee (MG). In Tamil Nadu, funds amounting to 120 million were gathered as MG and advance. The MG raised through audio rights and movie distribution to theatres in Andhra Pradesh, Kerala, Karnataka and overseas fetched a combined sum of 224 million. The film was distributed and released throughout Tamil Nadu by Aascar Films.\nThe rights for \"Aparichithudu\", the Telugu-dubbed version, was bought by a producer for an all-time record price. Meanwhile, the film was sold in Kerala for 13 million, which was again a record for a Tamil film there. The US rights was bought by the distribution house Bharat Creations. With the theatrical rights and pre-release booking, the trade circuit predicted that the film would recover its cost within ten days of its release.\nBox office.\nThe advance booking for the film began on 14 June 2005 across Tamil Nadu and received overwhelming response from the audience which the trade circuit felt was \"phenomenal\". The film took a \"historic opening\" worldwide and set multiple records at the box office. A day after release, the film was touted as a hit. In its opening weekend (17\u201319 June), \"Anniyan\" grossed 5.024 million from only six multiplexes in Chennai and reached #1 position at the Chennai box-office. In Sathyam Cinemas alone, the film grossed 1.4 million, the highest ever three-day opening from a single multiplex in South India.\nA week after release, the film grossed more than 10 million in Chennai, 2.7 million in Sathyam Cinemas, 7.1 million from 10 prints in Salem and netted 4.1 million in Coimbatore which were all box office records. And beyond Tamil Nadu, the film earned the distributors 12.7 million from Nizam in Andhra, 5 million in Karnataka and 1 million from 3 screens in Mumbai. The film got a hundred percent opening and surpassed \"Chandramukhi\" as the top-grossing Tamil film of the week, a position occupied by the latter since its release on 14 April 2005. IndiaGlitz likened the Vikram-Shankar combo to that of Sachin Tendulkar and Brian Lara batting together. The trade pundits estimated that V. Ravichandran would get a distributor's share of 80\u2013100 million in its first week from cinemas across Tamil Nadu. A week after its release, the Telugu-dubbed version \"Aparichithudu\" was declared a hit in Andhra Pradesh. Distributor Karunakara Reddy of Megha Films in Hyderabad quipped, \"\"Aparichitudu\" has taken an opening just like a Telugu superstar film and should collect a distributor's share of Rs. 5\u20137 crores for the Nizam area alone.\" In Kerala, \"Anniyan\" released in 35 screens across the state, receiving a \"record opening\" for a Tamil film and became the first Tamil film to get a distributors' share of 6.2 million in its first week. A fortnight after its release, the film was labelled a \"super hit\" in Tamil cinema's half-yearly report compiled by film trade analyst for \"The Hindu\" Sreedhar Pillai.\nIn exactly a six-week theatrical run, \"Anniyan\" netted 10.5 million with a distributor's share of around 5.2 million. It was an \"all India record for collections, the highest share in least number of days from any theatre in India.\" However, in Tamil Nadu, collections began dropping five weeks after its release and it was estimated that the film would earn a share of 160 million. In September 2005, the film's gross earnings surpassed the 2 million milestone. At the completion of a 50-day run at Sathyam Cinemas, \"Anniyan\" \"recorded the highest 50 days collection for a Tamil film from a single screen in the world\" earning 11.29 million.\n\"Anniyan\" was declared a blockbuster at the close of the year and, together with \"Chandramukhi\", earned an estimated gross of 1.1 billion worldwide. The film also collected a distributor's share of 20 million. In Andhra Pradesh, \"Aparichitudu\" was named the biggest hit of 2005. The film did better business than straight Telugu films. It was the highest grosser among all Telugu films released that year. The film's success earned Vikram a big fan-following in Andhra. It also prompted producers in the Telugu film industry, which had hit a rough patch following a spate of box-office failures, to acquire the dubbing rights to Vikram's previous Tamil films and release them in Telugu.\nIn Kerala, the film ran for more than 150 days and grossed over 60 million, it became the highest grossing Tamil film in Kerala at that time. In Karnataka too, the film was a \"big success\" although the exact box-office figures are not known. However, the film's Hindi version \"Aparichit\" opened to poor reception earning only 21 million across 150 screens and was declared a flop by Box Office India. While acknowledging that the film underperformed at the box-office, Vikram stated that it nevertheless made an impact. He further added that the film got him recognition from people in the remote corners of India as the drama and the action sequences greatly appealed to them. By the end of its theatrical run, the film had grossed 570 million in its lifetime.\nLegacy.\nIn an August 2005 seminar titled \"Revisiting psychiatric disorders in Tamil films\", where the discussion revolved around the films \"Chandramukhi\" and \"Anniyan\", psychiatrist Asokan found many logical faults in both films. While acknowledging that \"Anniyan\" was a technically better film, he stated that it did not explain some of the medical theories. In another August 2005 seminar conducted to mark the anniversary of the Quit India Movement, where participants were urged to actively fight corruption, the convener T. Hema Kumari referred to the films \"Bhaarateeyudu\" (the Telugu dubbed version of \"Indian\") and \"Aparichitudu\". She noted that while such films which depict a fight against corruption were appreciated, people were reluctant to join movements against such issues.\nRemake plans.\nDespite the dubbed Hindi version, in April 2021, it was announced that Shankar would direct a Hindi remake with Ranveer Singh reprising Vikram's role. However, in August 2021, it was reported that the remake is stalled due to the differences with producer V. Ravichandran. Ravichandran alleged that the film was getting a remake without his consent and he challenged it.\nImpact.\nDuring the 20th Vijayawada Book Festival held at Vijayawada in January 2009, \"Garuda Puranam\", one of the 18 puranas of Hinduism, was a best-seller. Writing for \"The Hindu\", G.V. Ramana Rao said that the book was made popular following several mentions in the film and sold like \"hot cakes\". Following the stupendous success of \"Aparichitudu\" in Andhra Pradesh, the State Transport Corporation of Warangal named a bus Remo, after the character played by Vikram in the film. When stand-up comedian and television anchor Bosskey launched a quirky play titled \"Dada\" (Don) in October 2005, he named the cast after famous characters in Tamil films. Accordingly, Anniyan (one of Vikram's character in the film), Badshah (Rajinikanth in \"Baashha\") and Velu Nayakkar (Kamal Haasan's role in \"Nayakan\") play the central characters of a family of brothers. Similarly, in the 2013 comedy film \"Onbadhule Guru\", in which the characters were named after popular protagonists of Tamil cinema, a member of the supporting cast was christened Anniyan.\nThe characters played by Vikram were spoofed by Vadivelu in the Tamil film \"Aaru\" (2005); the comedy sequence also features four songs from the film's soundtrack album. \"Aparichitudu\", the film's Telugu version, was parodied by comedian Venu Madhav in the Telugu films \"Chatrapati\" (2005) and \"Seenugadu Chiranjeevi Fan\" (2005). It was also parodied, along with \"Chandramukhi\", in the film \"Rajababu\" (2006). In the 2010 film \"Thamizh Padam\", a full-length parody on stereotypical characters and clich\u00e9d sequences in Tamil cinema, the lead actor Shiva recreates the \"Anthakoopam\" punishment sequence to comic effect, where he tries to force a herd of buffaloes into stampeding a villain but fails in his attempt. Later, the comedy sequence was re-enacted by Allari Naresh in \"Sudigadu\" (2012), an official remake of \"Thamizh Padam\". In the 2012 Kannada film \"Yaare Koogadali\", a remake of the Tamil film \"Poraali\" (2011), the long and unkempt hair sported by Puneeth Rajkumar was reportedly inspired by the look of Anniyan. The character Remo inspired Sivakarthikeyan's film to have a title of the same name."}
{"title": "Cousin_Bette", "label": "Book", "text": "La Cousine Bette (, \"Cousin Bette\") is an 1846 novel by French author Honor\u00e9 de Balzac. Set in mid-19th-century Paris, it tells the story of an unmarried middle-aged woman who plots the destruction of her extended family. Bette works with Val\u00e9rie Marneffe, an unhappily married young lady, to seduce and torment a series of men. One of these is Baron Hector Hulot, husband to Bette's cousin Adeline. He sacrifices his family's fortune and good name to please Val\u00e9rie, who leaves him for a well-off merchant named Crevel. The book is part of the \"Sc\u00e8nes de la vie parisienne\" section of Balzac's novel sequence \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\" (\"The Human Comedy\").\nIn the 1840s, a serial format is known as the \"roman-feuilleton\" was highly popular in France, and the most acclaimed expression of it was the socialist writing of Eug\u00e8ne Sue. Balzac wanted to challenge Sue's supremacy, and prove himself the most capable \"feuilleton\" author in France. Writing quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced \"La Cousine Bette\", one of his longest novels, in two months. It was published in \"Le Constitutionnel\" at the end of 1846, then collected with a companion work, \"Le Cousin Pons\", the following year.\nThe novel's characters represent polarities of contrasting morality. The vengeful Bette and disingenuous Val\u00e9rie stand on one side, with the merciful Adeline and her patient daughter Hortense on the other. The patriarch of the Hulot family, meanwhile, is consumed by his own sexual desire. Hortense's husband, the Polish exile Wenceslas Steinbock, represents artistic genius, though he succumbs to uncertainty and lack of motivation. Balzac based the character of Bette in part on his mother and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. At least one scene involving Baron Hulot was likely based on an event in the life of Balzac's friend, the novelist Victor Hugo.\n\"La Cousine Bette\" is considered Balzac's last great work. His trademark use of realist detail combines with a panorama of characters returning from earlier novels. Several critics have hailed it as a turning point in the author's career, and others have called it a prototypical naturalist text. It has been compared to William Shakespeare's \"Othello\" as well as Leo Tolstoy's \"War and Peace\". The novel explores themes of vice and virtue, as well as the influence of money on French society. Bette's relationship with Val\u00e9rie is also seen as an important exploration of homoerotic themes. A number of film versions of the story have been produced, including a 1971 BBC mini-series starring Margaret Tyzack and Helen Mirren, and a 1998 feature film with Jessica Lange in the title role. (The latter film, however, takes great liberties with the plot of Balzac's original work.)\nBackground.\nBy 1846 Honor\u00e9 de Balzac had achieved tremendous fame as a writer, but his finances and health were deteriorating rapidly. After writing a series of potboiler novels in the 1820s, he published his first book under his own name, \"Les Chouans\" (\"The Chouans\"), in 1829. He followed this with dozens of well-received novels and stories, including \"La Peau de chagrin\" (\"The Magic Skin\"), in 1831, \"Le P\u00e8re Goriot\" (\"Father Goriot\") in 1835, and the two-volume \"Illusions perdues\" (\"Lost Illusions\"), in 1837 and 1839. Because of his lavish lifestyle and penchant for financial speculation, however, he spent most of his life trying to repay a variety of debts. He wrote tirelessly, driven as much by economic necessity as by the muse and black coffee. This regimen of constant work exhausted his body and brought reprimands from his doctor.\nAs his work gained recognition, Balzac began corresponding with a Polish baroness named Ewelina Ha\u0144ska, who first contacted him through an anonymous 1832 letter signed \"L'\u00c9trang\u00e8re\" (\"The Stranger\"). They developed an affectionate friendship in letters, and when she became a widow in 1841, Balzac sought her hand in marriage. He visited her often in Poland and Germany, but various complications prohibited their union. One of these was an affair Balzac had with his housekeeper, Louise Breugniot. As she became aware of his affection for Mme. Hanska, Breugniot stole a collection of their letters and used them to extort money from Balzac. Even after this episode, however, he grew closer to Mme. Hanska with each visit and by 1846 he had begun preparing a home to share with her. He grew hopeful that they could marry when she became pregnant, but she fell ill in December and suffered a miscarriage.\nThe mid-19th century was a time of profound transformation in French government and society. The reign of King Charles\u00a0X ended in 1830 when a wave of agitation and dissent forced him to abdicate. He was replaced by Louis-Philippe, who named himself \"King of the French\", rather than the standard \"King of France\"\u00a0\u2013 an indication that he answered more to the nascent bourgeoisie than the aristocratic \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\". The change in government took place while the economy in France was moving from mercantilism to industrial development. This opened new opportunities for individuals hoping to acquire wealth and led to significant changes in social norms. Members of the aristocracy, for example, were forced to relate socially to the \"nouveau riche\", usually with tense results. The democratic spirit of the French Revolution also affected social interactions, with a shift in popular allegiance away from the church and the monarchy.\nIn the mid-19th century, a new style of the novel became popular in France. The serial format known as the \"roman-feuilleton\" presented stories in short regular installments, often accompanied by melodramatic plots and stock characters. Although Balzac's \"La Vieille Fille\" (\"The Old Maid\"), 1836, was the first such work published in France, the \"roman-feuilleton\" gained prominence thanks mostly to his friends Eug\u00e8ne Sue and Alexandre Dumas, p\u00e8re. Balzac disliked their serial writing, however, especially Sue's socialist depiction of lower-class suffering. Balzac wanted to dethrone what he called \"les faux dieux de cette litt\u00e9rature b\u00e2tarde\" (\"the false gods of this bastard literature\"). He also wanted to show the world that, despite his poor health and tumultuous career, he was \"plus jeune, plus frais, et plus grand que jamais\" (\"younger, fresher, and greater than ever\"). His first efforts to render a quality \"feuilleton\" were unsuccessful. Even though \"Splendeurs et mis\u00e8res des courtisanes\" (\"A Harlot High and Low\"), published in segments from 1838 to 1847, was celebrated by critics, Balzac complained to Mme. Hanska that he was \"doing pure Sue\". He tried again in 1844 with \"Modeste Mignon\", but public reactions were mixed. Two years later Balzac began a new project, determined to create something from his \"own old pen again\".\nWriting and publication.\nAfter resting for a week in June 1846 at the Ch\u00e2teau de Sach\u00e9 in Tours, Balzac returned to Paris and began working on a short story called \"Le Parasite\", which he eventually developed into the novel \"Le Cousin Pons\". He intended from the start to pair it with another novel, collecting them under the title \"Les Parents pauvres\" (\"The Poor Relations\"). He based the second book on a story his sister Laure Surville had written called \"La Cousine Rosalie\" and published in 1844 in \"Le Journal des enfants\". Writing intensively, he produced the entire novel, named \"La Cousine Bette\" after the main character, in two months. This was a significant accomplishment owing to his bad health, but its length made Balzac's writing speed especially remarkable. One critic calls the writing of \"Les Parents pauvres\" Balzac's \"last explosion of creative energy\". Another suggests that this effort was \"almost the last straw which broke down Balzac's gigantic strength\".\nBalzac's usual mode of revision involved vast, complicated edits made to galley proofs he received from the printer. When creating \"La Cousine Bette\", however, he submitted the work to his editor piece by piece, without viewing a single proof. The book was serialized in \"Le Constitutionnel\" from 8\u00a0October to 3\u00a0December, and Balzac rushed to keep up with the newspaper's rapid printing schedule. He produced an average of eight pages each day, but was struck by the unexpected enormity of the story as it evolved. Balzac was paid 12,836 francs for the series, which was later published with \"Le Cousin Pons\" as a twelve-volume book by Chiendowski and P\u00e9tion. The first collected edition of \"La Cousine Bette\" was organized into 132 chapters, but these divisions were removed when Balzac added it to his massive collection \"La Com\u00e9die humaine\" in 1848.\nPlot summary.\nThe first third of the novel provides a lengthy exploration of the characters' histories. Balzac makes this clear after 150 pages: \"Ici se termine, en quelque sorte, l'introduction de cette histoire.\" (\"Here ends what is, in a way, the introduction to this story.\") At the start of the novel, Adeline Hulot \u2013 wife of the successful Baron Hector Hulot \u2013 is being pressured into an affair by a wealthy perfumer named C\u00e9lestin Crevel. His desire stems in part from an earlier contest in which the adulterous Baron Hulot had won the attentions of the singer Jos\u00e9pha Mirah, also favored by Crevel. Mme. Hulot rejects Crevel's advances. The Baron has so completely lavished money on Jos\u00e9pha that he has borrowed heavily from his Uncle Johann \u2013 and, unable to repay the money, the Baron instead arranges a War Department post in Algeria for Johann, with instructions that Johann will be in a situation in that job to embezzle the borrowed money. The Hulots' daughter, Hortense, has begun searching for a husband; their son Victorin is married to Crevel's daughter Celestine.\nMme. Hulot's cousin, Bette (also called Lisbeth), harbors a deep but hidden resentment of her relatives' success, especially of Hortense 'stealing' Bette's intended sweetheart. A peasant woman with none of the physical beauty of her cousin, Bette has rejected a series of marriage proposals from middle-class suitors who were clearly motivated by her connection to the Hulots, and remains unmarried at the age of 42. One day she comes upon a young unsuccessful Polish sculptor named Wenceslas Steinbock, attempting suicide in the tiny apartment upstairs from her own. As she nourishes him back to health, she develops a maternal (and romantic) fondness for him. At the beginning of the story Bette is living in a modest apartment in a lodging house shared by the Marneffe couple, both of whom are ambitious and amoral. Bette befriends Val\u00e9rie, the young and very attractive wife of a War Department clerk, Fortin Marneffe; the two women form a bond to attain their separate goals \u2013 for Val\u00e9rie the acquisition of money and valuables, for Bette the ruination of the Hulot household by means of Val\u00e9rie's luring both the Baron and Steinbock into infidelity and financial ruin.\nBaron Hulot, meanwhile, is rejected by Jos\u00e9pha, who explains bluntly that she has chosen another man because of his larger fortune. Hulot's despair is quickly alleviated when he visits Bette in her lodging and there meets and falls in love with Val\u00e9rie Marneffe. He showers her with gifts, and soon establishes a luxurious house for her and M. Marneffe, with whom he works at the War Department (Bette joins them in their new home, to serve as an excuse for the Baron's visits). These debts, compounded by the money he borrowed to lavish on Jos\u00e9pha, threaten the Hulot family's financial security. Panicked, he convinces his uncle Johann Fischer to quietly embezzle funds from a War Department outpost in Algiers. Hulot's woes are momentarily abated and Bette's happiness is shattered, when\u00a0\u2013 at the end of the \"introduction\"\u00a0\u2013 Hortense Hulot marries Wenceslas Steinbock.\nCrushed at having lost Steinbock's as her intended spouse, Bette swears vengeance on the Hulot family. Her strategy is to work on Baron Hulot's demonstrated weakness for acquiring and lavishing more money than he has on young mistresses. Soon the Baron is completely besotted \u2013 and financially over-extended \u2013 with Val\u00e9rie, and completely compromised by repeatedly promoting her husband within the Baron's section of the War Department. Before long, Bette has already contrived to have Crevel and Steinbock also ensnared by Val\u00e9rie's charms. Hortense discovers Steinbock's infidelity and returns to her mother's home. Before long, the Baron's misconduct becomes known to the War Department; Uncle Johann is arrested in Algeria and commits suicide, the Baron is forced to retire suddenly, his brother, a famous war hero, saves him from prison and then quickly dies of shame over the family disgrace. The Baron deserts his family and hides from his creditors. It appears that Val\u00e9rie, soon a widow, will marry Crevel and thus gain entrance to the Hulot family as Celestine's mother-in-law. In short, the family is devastated by these repeated blows \u2013 and Bette's machinations are completely concealed from them.\nCharacters and inspirations.\nBalzac had written more than seventy novels when he began \"La Cousine Bette\", and populated them with recurring characters. Many of the characters in the novel, therefore, appear with extensive back-stories and biographical depth. For example, C\u00e9lestin Crevel first appeared in Balzac's 1837 novel \"C\u00e9sar Birotteau\", working for the title character. Having accumulated a considerable fortune in that book, Crevel spends his time in \"La Cousine Bette\" enjoying the spoils of his labor. Another important recurring character is Marshal Hulot, who first appeared as a colonel in \"Les Chouans\". In the years between that story and \"La Cousine Bette\", he became the Count of Forzheim; in a letter to the \"Constitutionnel\", Balzac described how Marshal Hulot gained this title. The presence of Crevel and Marshal Hulot\u00a0\u2013 among others\u00a0\u2013 in \"La Cousine Bette\" allows a continuation of each character's life story, adding emphasis or complexity to earlier events.\nOther recurring characters appear only briefly in \"La Cousine Bette\"; previous appearances, however, give deep significance to the characters' presence. This is the case with Vautrin, the criminal mastermind who tutors young Eugene de Rastignac in Balzac's 1835 novel \"Le P\u00e8re Goriot\". When he resurfaces in \"La Cousine Bette\", he has joined the police and introduces the Hulot family to his aunt, Mme. Nourrison, who offers a morally questionable remedy for their woes. Although Vautrin's presence in \"La Cousine Bette\" is brief, his earlier adventures in \"Le P\u00e8re Goriot\" provide instant recognition and emotional texture. Elsewhere, Balzac presents an entire world of experience by including characters from a particular sphere of society. For example, several scenes feature artists like Jean-Jacques Bixiou, who first appeared in 1837's \"Les Employ\u00e9s\" and in many other books thereafter. The world of Parisian nightlife is quickly brought to mind with the inclusion of several characters from \"Les Com\u00e9diens sans le savoir\" (1846), and Bianchon appears\u00a0\u2013 as always\u00a0\u2013 when a doctor is needed.\nBalzac's use of recurring characters has been identified as a unique component of his fiction. It enables a depth of characterization that goes beyond simple narration or dialogue. \"When the characters reappear\", notes the critic Samuel Rogers, \"they do not step out of nowhere; they emerge from the privacy of their own lives which, for an interval, we have not been allowed to see.\" Some readers, however, are intimidated by the depth created by these interdependent stories, and feel deprived of important context for the characters. Detective novelist Arthur Conan Doyle said that he never tried to read Balzac, because he \"did not know where to begin\". The characterization in \"La Cousine Bette\" is considered especially skillful. Anthony Pugh, in his book \"Balzac's Recurring Characters\", says that the technique is employed \"for the most part without that feeling of self-indulgence that mars some of Balzac's later work. Almost every example arises quite naturally out of the situation.\" Biographer Noel Gerson calls the characters in \"La Cousine Bette\" \"among the most memorable Balzac ever sketched\".\nBette Fischer.\nDescriptions of Bette are often connected to savagery and animal imagery. Her name, for example, is a homophone in French for \"b\u00eate\" (\"beast\"). One passage explains that \"elle ressemblait aux singes habill\u00e9s en femmes\" (\"she sometimes looked like one of those monkeys in petticoats\"); elsewhere her voice is described as having \"une jalousie de tigre\" (\"tiger-like jealousy\"). Her beastly rage comes to the surface with ferocity when she learns of Steinbock's engagement to Hortense:\nWhen she learns that her cousin Adeline has been welcoming Steinbock into the Hulot home, Bette swears revenge: \"Adeline! se dit Lisbeth, \u00f4 Adeline, tu me le payeras, je te rendrai plus laide que moi!\" (\"'Adeline!' muttered Lisbeth. 'Oh, Adeline, you shall pay for this! I will make you uglier than I am.'\") Her cruelty and lust for revenge lead critics to call her \"demonic\" and \"one of Balzac's most terrifying creations\". Because of her willingness to manipulate the people around her, Bette has been compared to Iago in William Shakespeare's play \"Othello\". Her fierce persona is attributed partly to her peasant background, and partly to her virginity, which provides (according to Balzac) \"une force diabolique ou la magie noire de la volont\u00e9\" (\"diabolical strength, or the black magic of the Will\").\nIn a letter to Mme. Hanska, Balzac indicated that he based the character of Bette on three women from his life: his mother, Mme. Hanska's aunt Rosalie Rzewuska, and the poet Marceline Desbordes-Valmore. Balzac had a tumultuous relationship with his mother for most of his life, and he incorporated some of her personality (particularly her \"obstinate persistence in living\", as one critic calls it) into Bette. Rosalie Rzewuska disapproved of Mme. Hanska's relationship with Balzac; biographers agree that her cold determination was part of the author's recipe for Bette. Elements taken from Marceline Desbordes-Valmore are more complex; she faced many setbacks in life and she and Balzac became friends after she left the theatre to take up poetry.\nVal\u00e9rie Marneffe.\nBette's co-conspirator in the destruction of the Hulot family is beautiful and greedy Val\u00e9rie Marneffe, the unsatisfied wife of a War Department clerk. They develop a deep friendship, which many critics consider an example of lesbian affection. Because of their relationship and similar goals, the critic Frederic Jameson says that \"Val\u00e9rie serves as a kind of \"emanation\" of Bette\".\nVal\u00e9rie is repulsed by her ugly husband and has gone five years without kissing him. She explains bluntly that her position as a married woman provides subtleties and options unavailable to the common prostitute who has one set price; after Marneffe dies, Val\u00e9rie jockeys for position between Hulot and Mont\u00e9s (while also sleeping with Steinbock), then discards them all to marry Crevel, who offers the most wealth. She amuses herself by mocking her lovers' devotion, and this wickedness\u00a0\u2013 not to mention her gruesome demise\u00a0\u2013 has led some critics to speculate that she is actually the focus of Balzac's morality tale.\nIn one important scene, Val\u00e9rie models for Steinbock as Delilah, standing victorious over the ruined Samson. With obvious parallels to her own activities, she describes her vision for the piece: \"Il s'agit d'exprimer la puissance de la femme. Samson n'est rien, l\u00e0. C'est le cadavre de la force. Dalila, c'est la passion qui ruine tout.\" (\"What you have to show is the power of woman. Samson is a secondary consideration. He is the corpse of dead strength. It is Delilah\u2014passion\u2014that ruins everything.\")\nAlthough Balzac did not draw specifically from the women in his life to create Val\u00e9rie, parallels have been observed in some areas. The tumultuous end of his affair with Louise Breugniot and the advantage she gains from his devotion to Mme. Hanska is similar in some ways to Val\u00e9rie's manipulation of Steinbock. Critics also connect the pride and anguish felt by Balzac during Mme. Hanska's pregnancy and miscarriage to the same emotions felt by Baron Hulot when Val\u00e9rie conceives and loses her child. Although he never ascribed to Mme. Hanska any of the traits in Val\u00e9rie's treacherous character, he felt a devotion similar to that of Hulot. He once wrote to her: \"je fais pour mon Eve toute les folies qu'un Hulot fait pour une Marneffe, je te donnerai mon sang, mon honneur, ma vie\" (\"I commit for [you] all the follies that a Hulot commits for Madame Marneffe; I give you my blood, my honor, my life\").\nHector and Adeline Hulot.\nBaron Hector Hulot is a living manifestation of male sexual desire, unrestrained and unconcerned with its consequences for the man or his family. As the novel progresses, he becomes consumed by his libido, even in a physical sense. When Val\u00e9rie tells him to stop dyeing his hair, he does so to please her. His financial woes and public disgrace lead him to flee his own home; by the end of the book he is an elderly, decrepit shell of a man. Baron Hulot is so overcome by his taste for female flesh that he even asks his wife\u00a0\u2013 without irony\u00a0\u2013 if he can bring home his fifteen-year-old mistress.\nAdeline Hulot, on the other hand, is mercy personified. Like her cousin Bette, she comes from a peasant background, but has internalized the ideals of 19th-century womanhood, including devotion, grace, and deference. She reveals in the first scene that she has known for years about her husband's infidelities, but refuses to condemn him. Adeline's forgiving nature is often considered a significant character flaw. Some suggest that she is partly to blame for Hulot's wandering affection. C.A. Prendergast, for example, calls her forgiveness \"an inadequate and even positively disastrous response\" to her situation. He further suggests that Adeline, by choosing the role of quiet and dutiful wife, has excised from herself the erotic power to which the Baron is drawn. \"[O]ne could at the very least offer the tentative speculation that Hulot's obsessional debauchery is in part the result of a certain poverty in Adeline, that the terrible logic of Hulot's excess is partially shaped by a crucial deficiency in his wife.\" Others are less accusatory; Adeline's nearly infinite mercy, they say, is evidence of foolishness. Critic Herbert J. Hunt declares that she shows \"more imbecility than Christian patience\", and David Bellos points out that, like her husband, she is driven by passion\u00a0\u2013 albeit of a different kind: \"Adeline's desire (for good, for the family, for Hector, for God) is so radically different from the motivating desires of the other characters that she seems in their context to be without desire\u00a0...\"\nBalzac's inspiration for the characters of Hector and Adeline remain unclear, but several critics have been eager to speculate. Three officers named Hulot were recognized for their valor in the Napoleonic Wars, and some suggest that Balzac borrowed the name of Comte Hector d'Aure. None of these men, however, were known for the sort of philandering or thievery exhibited by Baron Hulot in the novel. Instead, Balzac may have used himself as the model; his many affairs with women across the social spectrum lead some to suggest that the author \"found much of Hulot in himself\". Balzac's friend Victor Hugo, meanwhile, was famously discovered in bed with his mistress in July 1845. The similarity of his name to Hector Hulot (and that of his wife's maiden name, Ad\u00e8le Foucher, to Adeline Fischer) has been posited as a possible indication of the characters' origins.\nWenceslas Steinbock.\nThe Polish sculptor Wenceslas Steinbock is important primarily because of Bette's attachment to him. He offers Bette a source of pride, a way for her to prove herself worthy of her family's respect. When Hortense marries Steinbock, Bette feels as though she has been robbed. Prendergast insists that the incident \"must literally be described as an act of theft\".\nSteinbock's relevance also lies in his background and profession, illustrating Balzac's conception of the Polish people, as well as himself. Having spent more than a decade befriending Mme. Hanska and visiting her family in Poland, Balzac believed he had insight into the national character (as he felt about most groups he observed). Thus, descriptions of Steinbock are often laced with commentary about the Polish people: \"Soyez mon amie, dit-il avec une de ces d\u00e9monstrations caressantes si famili\u00e8res aux Polonais, et qui les font accuser assez injustement de servilit\u00e9.\" (\"'Be my sweetheart,' he added, with one of the caressing gestures familiar to the Poles, for which they are unjustly accused of servility.\")\nCritics also consider Steinbock important because of his artistic genius. Like Louis Lambert and Lucien Chardon in \"Illusions perdues\", he is a brilliant man\u00a0\u2013 just as Balzac considered himself to be. Before he is nurtured and directed by Bette, however, Steinbock's genius languishes under his own inertia and he attempts suicide. Later, when he leaves Bette's circle of influence, he fails again. Thus he demonstrates Balzac's conviction that genius alone is useless without determination. Bellos organizes Steinbock and Bette into a duality of weakness and strength; whereas the Polish artist is unable to direct his energies into productive work, Bette draws strength from her virginity and thus becomes powerful by denying the lust to which Steinbock falls prey. Steinbock's drive is further eroded by the praise he receives for his art, which gives him an inflated sense of accomplishment. One critic refers to the artist's downfall as \"vanity\u00a0... spoiled by premature renown\".\nStyle.\nIf Balzac's goal was (as he claimed) to write a realist novel from his \"own old pen\" rather than mimic the style of Eug\u00e8ne Sue, history and literary criticism have declared him successful. William Stowe calls \"La Cousine Bette\" \"a masterpiece of classical realism\" and Bellos refers to it as \"one of the great achievements of nineteenth-century realism\", comparing it to \"War and Peace\". Some sections of the book are criticized for being melodramatic, and Balzac biographer V. S. Pritchett even refers to a representative excerpt as \"bad writing\". Most critics, however, consider the moralistic elements of the novel deceptively complex, and some point out that the \"roman-feuilleton\" format required a certain level of titillation to keep readers engaged. Others indicate that Balzac's interest in the theatre was an important reason for the inclusion of melodramatic elements.\nBalzac's trademark realism begins on the first page of the novel, wherein Crevel is described wearing a National Guard uniform, complete with the L\u00e9gion d'honneur. Details from the 1830s also appear in the novel's geographic locations. The Hulot family home, for example, is found in the aristocratic area of Paris known as the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Bette's residence is on the opposite end of the social spectrum, in the impoverished residential area which surrounded the Louvre: \"Les t\u00e9n\u00e8bres, le silence, l'air glacial, la profondeur caverneuse du sol concourent \u00e0 faire de ces maisons des esp\u00e8ces de cryptes, des tombeaux vivants.\" (\"Darkness, silence, an icy chill, and the cavernous depth of the soil combine to make these houses a kind of crypt, tombs of the living.\") Descriptions of her meager quarters are\u00a0\u2013 as usual in Balzac's work\u00a0\u2013 an acute reflection of her personality. The same is true of the Marneffe home at the outset: it contains \"les trompeuses apparences de ce faux luxe\" (\"the illusory appearance of sham luxury\"), from the shabby chairs in the drawing-room to the dust-coated bedroom.\nPrecise detail is not spared in descriptions of decay and disease, two vivid elements in the novel. Marneffe, for example, represents crapulence. His decrepit body is a symbol of society's weakness at the time, worn away from years of indulgence. The poison which kills Val\u00e9rie and Crevel is also described in ghastly detail. The doctor Bianchon explains: \"Ses dents et ses cheveux tombent, elle a l'aspect des l\u00e9preux, elle se fait horreur \u00e0 elle-m\u00eame; ses mains, \u00e9pouvantables \u00e0 voir, sont enfl\u00e9es et couvertes de pustules verd\u00e2tres; les ongles d\u00e9chauss\u00e9s restent dans les plaies qu'elle gratte; enfin, toutes les extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s se d\u00e9truisent dans la sanie qui les ronge.\" (\"She is losing her hair and teeth, her skin is like a leper's, she is a horror to herself; her hands are horrible, covered with greenish pustules, her nails are loose, and the flesh is eaten away by the poisoned humors.\")\n\"La Cousine Bette\" is unapologetic in its bleak outlook, and makes blunt connections between characters' origins and behavior. For these reasons, it is considered a key antecedent to naturalist literature. Novelist \u00c9mile Zola called it an important \"roman exp\u00e9rimental\" (\"experimental novel\"), and praised its acute exploration of the characters' motivations. Some critics note that \"La Cousine Bette\" showed an evolution in Balzac's style\u00a0\u2013 one which he had little time to develop. Pointing to the nuance of plot and comprehensive narration style, Stowe suggests that the novel \"might in happier circumstances have marked the beginning of a new, mature 'late Balzac'\".\nThemes.\nPassion, vice, and virtue.\nVal\u00e9rie's line about Delilah being \"la passion qui ruine tout\" (\"passion which ruins everything\") is symbolic, coming as it does from a woman whose passion accelerates the ruin of most people around her\u00a0\u2013 including herself. Baron Hulot, meanwhile, is desire incarnate; his wandering libido bypasses concern for his wife, brother, children, finances, and even his own health. Bette is living vengeance, and Adeline desperately yearns for the happy home she imagined in the early years of marriage. Each character is driven by a fiery passion, which in most cases consumes the individual. As Balzac puts it: \"La passion est un martyre.\" (\"Passion is martyrdom.\")\nThe intensity of passion, and the consequences of its manifestation, result in a stark contrast of vice and virtue. Bette and Val\u00e9rie are pure wickedness, and even celebrate the ruin of their targets. As one critic says, \"life's truths are viewed in their most atrocious form\". Mocking the use of the guillotine during the French Revolution while acknowledging her own malicious intent, Val\u00e9rie says with regard to Delilah: \"La vertu coupe la t\u00eate, le Vice ne vous coupe que les cheveux.\" (\"Virtue cuts off your head; vice only cuts off your hair.\") Hulot is not intentionally cruel, but his actions are no less devastating to the people around him.\nOn the other side of the moral divide, Adeline and her children stand as shining examples of virtue and nobility\u00a0\u2013 or so it would seem. Hortense ridicules her aunt when Bette mentions her prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Wenceslas Steinbock, providing a psychological catalyst for the ensuing conflict. Victorin repeatedly expresses outrage at his father's philandering, yet crosses a significant moral boundary when he agrees to fund Mme. Nourrison's plan to eradicate Val\u00e9rie. As one critic puts it, Victorin's decision marks a point in the novel where \"the scheme of right versus wrong immediately dissolves into a purely amoral conflict of different interests and passions, regulated less by a transcendent moral law than by the relative capacity of the different parties for cunning and ruthlessness.\" The cruelties of the Hulot children are brief but significant, owing as much to their obliviousness (intentional in the case of Victorin, who asks not to learn the details of Mme. Nourrison's scheme) as to malicious forethought.\nThe question of Adeline's virtue is similarly complicated. Although she is forgiving to the point of absurdity, she is often considered more of a dupe than a martyr. Some have compared her to Balzac's title character in \"Le P\u00e8re Goriot\", who sacrifices himself for his daughters. As Bellos puts it: \"Adeline's complicity with Hector certainly makes her more interesting as a literary character, but it undermines her role as the symbol of virtue in the novel.\" This complicity reaches an apex when she unsuccessfully attempts to sell her affections to Crevel (who has since lost interest) in order to repay her husband's debts. Her flirtation with prostitution is sometimes considered more egregious than Val\u00e9rie's overt extortion, since Adeline is soiling her own dignity in the service of Baron Hulot's infidelity. For the remainder of the novel, Adeline trembles uncontrollably, a sign of her weakness. Later, when she visits the singer Jos\u00e9pha (on whom her husband once doted), Adeline is struck by the splendor earned by a life of materialistic seduction. She wonders aloud if she is capable of providing the carnal pleasures Hulot seeks outside of their home.\nUltimately, both vice and virtue fail. Val\u00e9rie is devoured by Mont\u00e9s' poison, a consequence of her blithe attitude toward his emotion. Bette is unsuccessful in her effort to crush her cousin's family, and dies (as one critic puts it) \"in the margins\". Adeline's Catholic mercy, on the other hand, fails to redeem her husband, and her children are similarly powerless\u00a0\u2013 as Victorin finally admits on the novel's last page. Like Raphael de Valentin in Balzac's 1831 novel \"La Peau de chagrin\", Hulot is left with nothing but \"vouloir\": desire, a force which is both essential for human existence and eventually apocalyptic.\nGender and homoeroticism.\nGender roles, especially the figure of the ideal woman, are central to \"La Cousine Bette\". The four leading female characters (Bette, Val\u00e9rie, Adeline, and Hortense) embody stereotypically feminine traits. Each pair of women revolves around a man, and they compete for his attention: Val\u00e9rie and Adeline for Baron Hulot; Bette and Hortense for Wenceslas Steinbock. Balzac's study of masculinity is limited to the insatiable lust of Hulot and the weak-willed inconstancy of Steinbock, with the occasional appearance of Victorin as a sturdy patriarch in his father's absence.\nCritics pay special attention to Bette's lack of traditional femininity, and her unconventional relationships with two characters. She is described from the outset as having \"des qualit\u00e9s d'homme\" (\"certain manly qualities\"), with similar descriptions elsewhere. Her relationship and attitude toward Steinbock, moreover, hint at her masculinity. She commands him into submission, and even binds him with economic constraints by lending him the money to develop his sculpture. Her domination is tempered by maternal compassion, but the couple's relationship is compared to an abusive marriage: \"Il fut comme une femme qui pardonne les mauvais traitements d'une semaine \u00e0 cause des caresses d'un fugitif raccommodement.\" (\"He was like a woman who forgives a week of ill-usage for the sake of a kiss and a brief reconciliation.\")\nBette's relationship with Val\u00e9rie is layered with overtones of lesbianism. Early in the book Bette is \"capt\u00e9e\" (\"bewitched\") by Val\u00e9rie, and quickly declares to her: \"Je vous aime, je vous estime, je suis \u00e0 vous!\" (\"I love you, I esteem you, I am wholly yours!\") This affection may have been platonic, but neighbors of the Marneffes\u00a0\u2013 along with many readers\u00a0\u2013 suspect that their bond transcends friendship. As with Steinbock, Bette and Val\u00e9rie assume butch and femme roles; the narration even mentions \"Le contraste de la m\u00e2le et s\u00e8che nature de la Lorraine avec la jolie nature cr\u00e9ole de Val\u00e9rie\" (\"The contrast between Lisbeth's dry masculine nature and Valerie's creole prettiness\"). The homoeroticism evolves through the novel, as Bette feeds on Val\u00e9rie's power to seduce and control the Hulot men. As one critic says: \"Val\u00e9rie's body becomes, at least symbolically, the locus of Bette's only erotic pleasure.\"\nWealth and society.\nAs with many of his novels, Balzac analyzes the influence of history and social status in \"La Cousine Bette\". The book takes places between 1838 and 1846, when the reign of Louis-Philippe reflected and directed significant changes in the social structure. Balzac was a legitimist favoring the House of Bourbon, and idolized Napoleon Bonaparte as a paragon of effective absolutist power. Balzac felt that French society under the House of Orl\u00e9ans lacked strong leadership, and was fragmented by the demands of parliament. He also believed that Catholicism provided guidance for the nation, and that its absence heralded moral decay.\nBalzac demonstrated these beliefs through the characters' lives in \"La Cousine Bette\". The conflict between Baron Hulot and the perfumer Crevel mirrors the animosity between the aristocracy of the \"Ancien R\u00e9gime\" and the newly developed bourgeoisie of traders and industrial entrepreneurs. Although he despised the socialist politics of Eug\u00e8ne Sue, Balzac worried that bourgeois desperation for financial gain drove people from life's important virtues. The characters\u00a0\u2013 especially Bette, Val\u00e9rie, and Crevel\u00a0\u2013 are fixated on their need for money, and do whatever they must to obtain it. As Crevel explains to Adeline: \"Vous vous abusez, cher ange, si vous croyez que c'est le roi Louis-Philippe qui r\u00e8gne\u00a0... au-dessus de la Charte il y a la sainte, la v\u00e9n\u00e9r\u00e9e, la solide, l'aimable, la gracieuse, la belle, la noble, la jeune, la toute-puissante pi\u00e8ce de cent sous!\" (\"You are quite mistaken, my angel, if you suppose that King Louis-Philippe rules us\u00a0... supreme above the Charter reigns the holy, venerated, substantial, delightful, obliging, beautiful, noble, ever-youthful, and all-powerful five-franc piece!\")\nThemes of corruption and salvation are brought to the fore as Val\u00e9rie and Crevel lie dying from the mysterious poison. When his daughter urges him to meet with a priest, Crevel angrily refuses, mocking the church and indicating that his social stature will be his salvation: \"la mort regarde \u00e0 deux fois avant de frapper un maire de Paris!\" (\"Death thinks twice of it before carrying off a Mayor of Paris.\") Val\u00e9rie, meanwhile, makes a deathbed conversion and urges Bette to abandon her quest for revenge. Ever the courtesan, Val\u00e9rie describes her new Christianity in terms of seduction: \"je ne puis maintenant plaire qu'\u00e0 Dieu! je vais t\u00e2cher de me r\u00e9concilier avec lui, ce sera ma derni\u00e8re coquetterie!\" (\"I can please no one now but God. I will try to be reconciled to Him, and that will be my last flirtation\u00a0...!\")\nReception and adaptations.\nThe critical reaction to \"La Cousine Bette\" was immediate and positive, which Balzac did not expect. Whether due to the intensity of its creation or the tumult of his personal life, the author was surprised by the praise he received. He wrote: \"I did not realize how good \"La Cousine Bette\" is\u00a0... There is an immense reaction in my favour. I have won!\" The collected edition sold consistently well, and was reprinted nineteen times before the turn of the 20th century. 20th-century critics remain enthusiastic in their praise for the novel; Saintsbury insists it is \"beyond all question one of the very greatest of [Balzac's] works\". Biographer Graham Robb calls \"La Cousine Bette\" \"the masterpiece of his premature old age\".\nSome 19th-century critics attacked the book, on the grounds that it normalized vice and corrupt living. Chief among these were disciples of the utopian theorist Charles Fourier; they disapproved of the \"immorality\" inherent in the novel's bleak resolution. Critics like Alfred Nettement and Eug\u00e8ne Marron declared that Balzac's sympathy lay with Baron Hulot and Val\u00e9rie Marneffe. They lambasted him for not commenting more on the characters' degenerate behavior\u00a0\u2013 the same stylistic choice later celebrated by naturalist writers \u00c9mile Zola and Hippolyte Taine.\nBalzac's novel has been adapted several times for the screen. The first was in 1928, when French filmmaker Max DeRieux directed Alice Tissot in the title role. Margaret Tyzack played the role of Bette in the five part serial \"Cousin Bette\" made in 1971 by the BBC, which also starred Helen Mirren as Val\u00e9rie Marneffe. The film \"Cousin Bette\" was released in 1998, directed by Des McAnuff. Jessica Lange starred in the title role, joined by Bob Hoskins as Crevel, and Elisabeth Shue as the singer Jenny Cadine. Screenwriters Lynn Siefert and Susan Tarr changed the story significantly, and eliminated Val\u00e9rie. The 1998 film was panned by critics for its generally poor acting and awkward dialogue. Stephen Holden of the \"New York Times\" commented that the movie \"treats the novel as a thoroughly modern social comedy peopled with raging narcissists, opportunists and flat-out fools\". The 1998 film changed the novel quite drastically, retaining the basic idea of Bette avenging herself on her enemies, and not only eliminating Valerie, but letting Bette survive at the end.\n\"La Cousine Bette\" was adapted for the stage by Jeffrey Hatcher, best known for his screenplay \"Stage Beauty\" (based on his stage play \"Compleat Female Stage Beauty\"). The Antaeus Company in North Hollywood produced a workshop in 2008 and presented the world premiere of \"Cousin Bette\" in early 2010 in North Hollywood, California. The adaptation retains many of the main characters but places Bette as the story's narrator."}
{"title": "She:_A_History_of_Adventure", "label": "Book", "text": "She, subtitled A History of Adventure, is a novel by the English writer H. Rider Haggard, published in book form in 1887 following serialisation in \"The Graphic\" magazine between October 1886 and January 1887. \"She\" was extraordinarily popular upon its release and has never been out of print.\nThe story is a first-person narrative which follows the journey of Horace Holly and his ward Leo Vincey to a lost kingdom in the African interior. They encounter a primitive race of natives and a mysterious white queen named Ayesha who reigns as the all-powerful \"She\" or \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\". Haggard developed many of the conventions of the lost world genre which countless authors have emulated.\nHaggard was \"part of the literary reaction against domestic realism that has been called a romance revival.\" Other writers following this trend were Robert Louis Stevenson, George MacDonald, and William Morris. Haggard was inspired by his experiences living in South Africa for seven years (1875\u201382) working at the highest levels of the British colonial administration. In the figure of She, the novel notably explored themes of female authority and feminine behaviour. Its representation of womanhood has received both praise and criticism.\nSynopsis.\nA young Cambridge University professor, Horace Holly, is visited by a colleague, Vincey, who reveals that he will soon die. Vincey proceeds to tell Holly a fantastical tale of his family heritage. He charges Holly with the task of raising his young son, Leo (whom he has never seen) and gives Holly a locked iron box, with instructions that it is not to be opened until Leo turns 25. Holly agrees, and indeed Vincey is found dead the next day. Holly raises the boy as his own; when the box is opened on Leo's 25th birthday they discover the ancient and mysterious \"Sherd of Amenartas\", which seems to corroborate Leo's father's story. Holly, Leo and their servant, Job, follow instructions on the Sherd and travel to eastern Africa but are shipwrecked. They alone survive, together with their Arab captain, Mahomed; after a perilous journey into an uncharted region of the African interior, they are captured by the savage Amahagger people. The adventurers learn that the natives are ruled by a fearsome white queen, who is worshipped as \"Hiya\" or \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\". The Amahagger are curious about the white-skinned interlopers, having been warned of their coming by the mysterious queen.\nBillali, the chief elder of one of the Amahagger tribes, takes charge of the three men, introducing them to the ways of his people. One of the Amahagger maidens, Ustane, takes a liking to Leo and, by kissing him and embracing him publicly, weds him according to Amahagger customs. Leo, likewise, grows very fond of her.\nBillali tells Holly that he needs to go and report the white men's arrival to She. In his absence, some of the Amahagger become restless and seize Mahomed, intending to eat him as part of a ritual \"hot pot\". Realising what is about to happen, Holly shoots several of the Amahagger. Mahomed dies in the effort to save him from the hot pot, when a bullet passes through one of the Amahagger and kills him as well. In the ensuing struggle Leo is gravely wounded, but Ustane saves his life by throwing herself onto his prostrate body to shield him from spears. All seems lost as the Amahagger resolve to kill Ustane along with the white men but Billali returns in the nick of time and declares that the three men are under the protection of She. Leo's condition, however, worsens and he eventually nears death as Ustane faithfully attends to him.\nThey are taken to the home of the queen, which lies near the ruins of the lost city of K\u00f4r, a once mighty civilisation that predated the Egyptians. The queen and her retinue live under a dormant volcano in a series of catacombs built as tombs for the people of K\u00f4r. There, Holly is presented to the queen, a white sorceress named Ayesha. Her beauty is so great that it enchants any man who beholds it. She, who is veiled and lies behind a partition, warns Holly that the power of her splendour arouses both desire and fear, but he is dubious. When she shows herself, however, Holly is enraptured and prostrates himself before her. Ayesha reveals that she has learned the secret of immortality and that she possesses other supernatural powers including the ability to read the minds of others, a form of clairvoyance and the ability to heal wounds and cure illness; she is also revealed to have a tremendous knowledge of chemistry, but is notably unable to see into the future. She tells Holly that she has lived in the realm of K\u00f4r for more than two millennia, awaiting the reincarnated return of her lover, Kallikrates (whom she had slain in a fit of jealous rage). Later, when Holly inadvertently and secretly discovers Ayesha in her hidden chamber, he learns that she may have some degree of power to reanimate the dead.\nThe next evening She visits Leo to heal him. But upon seeing his face, she is stunned and declares him to be the reincarnation of Kallikrates. She saves him and becomes jealous of Ustane. The latter is ordered to leave Leo and never to set her eyes on him again. Ustane refuses, however, and Ayesha eventually strikes her dead with magic. Despite the murder of their friend, Holly and Leo cannot free themselves from the power of Ayesha's beauty and Leo becomes bewitched. In explaining her history, Ayesha shows Leo the perfectly preserved body of Kallikrates, which she has kept with her, but she then dissolves the remains with a powerful acid, confident that Leo is indeed the reincarnation of her former lover.\nIn the climax of the novel, Ayesha takes the two men to see the Pillar of Fire, passing through the ruined city of K\u00f4r into the heart of the ancient volcano. She is determined that Leo should bathe in the fire to become immortal and remain with her forever, and that together they can become the immortal and all-powerful rulers of the world. After a perilous journey, they come to a great cavern, where Leo doubts the safety of entering the flame. To allay his fears, Ayesha steps into the Spirit of Life, but with this second immersion, the life-preserving power is lost and Ayesha begins to revert to her true age. Holly speculates that it may be that a second exposure undoes the effects of the previous or the Spirit of Life spews death on occasion. Before their eyes, Ayesha withers away in the fire, and her body shrinks. The sight is so shocking that Job dies in fright. Before dying, Ayesha tells Leo, \"Forget me not. I shall come again!\"\nBackground.\nSouth Africa.\nIn 1875, Haggard was sent to Cape Town, South Africa as secretary to Sir Henry Bulwer, the lieutenant-governor of Natal. Haggard wrote in his memoirs of his aspirations to become a colonial governor himself, and of his youthful excitement at the prospects. The major event during his time in Africa was Britain's annexation of the Transvaal in 1877. Haggard was part of the expedition that established British control over the Boer republic, and which helped raise the Union flag over the capital of Pretoria on 24 May 1877. Writing of the moment, Haggard declared:\nHaggard had advocated the British annexation of the Boer republic in a journal article entitled \"The Transvaal\", published in the May 1877 issue of \"Macmillan's Magazine\". He maintained that it was Britain's \"mission to conquer and hold in subjection, not from thirst of conquest but for the sake of law, justice, and order\". However, Boer resistance to annexation and the resulting Anglo-Zulu War caused the government in London to withdraw from pursuing sovereignty over the South African interior. Haggard considered this to be a \"great betrayal\" by Prime Minister Gladstone and the Liberal Party, which \"no lapse of time ever can solace or even alleviate\". He became increasingly disillusioned with the realities of colonial Africa. Victorian scholar Patrick Brantlinger notes in his introduction to \"She\": \"Little that Haggard witnessed matched the romantic depictions of 'the dark continent' in boys' adventure novels, in the press, and even in such bestselling explorers' journals as David Livingstone's \"Missionary Travels and Researches in South Africa\" (1857).\"\nDuring his time in South Africa, Haggard developed an intense hatred for the Boers, but also came to admire the Zulus. However, his admiration of the Zulus did not extend to other African peoples; rather, he shared many of the assumptions that underlay contemporary politics and philosophy, such as those expressed by James Hunt, the President of the Anthropological Society of London: \"the Negro is inferior intellectually to the European...[and] can only be humanised and civilised by Europeans. The analogies are far more numerous between the Negro and apes, than between the European and apes.\" The Victorian belief in the inherent inferiority of the 'darker races' made them the object of a civilising impulse in the European Scramble for Africa. Although disenchanted with the colonial effort, Haggard remained committed to this ideology. He believed that the British \"alone of all the nations in the world appear to be able to control coloured races without the exercise of cruelty\".\nReturn to Britain.\nRider Haggard returned to Britain in 1881. At the time, England was increasingly beset by the social and cultural anxieties that marked the \"fin de si\u00e8cle\". One of the most prominent concerns was the fear of political and racial decline, encapsulated in Max Nordau's \"Degeneration\" (1895). Barely half a century earlier, Thomas Babington Macaulay had declared \"the history of England\" to be \"emphatically the history of progress\", but late-Victorians living in the wake of Darwinian evolutionary theory had lost the earlier positivism of their age. Uncertainty over the immutability of Britain's historical identity, what historian Tim Murray has called the \"threat of the past\", was manifested in the Victorian obsession with ancient times and archaeology. Haggard was greatly interested in the ruins discovered at Zimbabwe in the 1870s. In 1896, he provided the preface to a monograph that detailed a history of the site, declaring:\nBy the time that Haggard began writing \"She\", society had more anxiety about the role of women. Debates regarding \"The Woman Question\" dominated Britain during the \"fin de si\u00e8cle\", as well as anxieties over the increasing position and independence of the \"New Woman\". Alarm over social degeneration and societal decadence further fanned concerns over the women's movement and female liberation, which challenged the traditional conception of Victorian womanhood. The role and rights of women had changed dramatically since the early part of the century, as they entered the workforce, received better education, and gained more political and legal independence. Writing in 1894, Haggard believed that marriage was the natural state for women: \"Notwithstanding the energetic repudiations of the fact that confront us at every turn, it may be taken for granted that in most cases it is the natural mission of women to marry; that \u2013 always in most cases \u2013 if they do not marry they become narrowed, live a half life only, and suffer in health of body and of mind.\" He created the character of \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\" \"who provided a touchstone for many of the anxieties surrounding the New Woman in late-Victorian England\".\nConcept and creation.\nAccording to Haggard's daughter Lilias, the phrase \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\" originated from his childhood and \"the particularly hideous aspect\" of one rag-doll: \"This doll was something of a fetish, and Rider, as a small child, was terrified of her, a fact soon discovered by an unscrupulous nurse who made full use of it to frighten him into obedience. Why or how it came to be called She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed he could not remember.\" Haggard wrote that \"the title \"She\"\" was taken \"from a certain rag doll, so named, which a nurse at Bradenham used to bring out of some dark recess in order to terrify those of my brothers and sisters who were in her charge.\"\nIn his autobiography Haggard writes of how he composed \"She\" in six weeks in February and March 1886, having just completed \"Jess\", which was published in 1887. Haggard claimed that this was an intensely creative period: the text \"was never rewritten, and the manuscript carries but few corrections\". Haggard went on to declare: \"The fact is that it was written at white heat, almost without rest, and that is the best way to compose.\" He admitted to having had no clear story in mind when he began writing:\nVarious scholars have detected a number of analogues to \"She\" in earlier literature. According to Brantlinger, Haggard certainly read the stories of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, in particular \"A Strange Story\" (1862), which includes a mysterious veiled woman called \"Ayesha\", and \"The Coming Race\" (1871), which is about the discovery of a subterranean civilisation. Similarly, the name of the underground civilisation in \"She\", known as K\u00f4r, is derived from Norse mythological romance, where the deathbed of the goddess Hel is called K\u00f6r, which means \"disease\" in Old Norse. In \"She\", a plague destroyed the original inhabitants of K\u00f4r.\nAccording to Haggard, he wrote the final scene of Ayesha's demise while waiting for his literary agent, A. P. Watt, to return to his office. Once he had completed it he entered Watt's office and threw the manuscript \"on the table, with the remark: 'There is what I shall be remembered by'\".\nA reference to \"She\" appears in Lieutenant George Witton's book \"Scapegoats of the Empire; The True Story of the Bushveldt Carbineers\" (1907):\nPublication.\n\"She\" was first published as a serial story in \"The Graphic\", a large folio magazine printed weekly in London, between October 1886 and January 1887. The serialisation was accompanied with illustrations by E. K. Johnson. An American edition was published by Harper &amp; Bros. in New York on 24 December 1886; this included Johnson's illustrations. On 1 January 1887 a British edition was published by Longmans, Green, &amp; Co., without any illustrations. It featured significant textual revisions by Haggard. He made further revisions for the British edition of 1888, which included new illustrations by Maurice Greiffenhagen and C. H. M. Kerr. In 2006 Broadview published the first edition of \"She\" since 1887 to reproduce the \"Graphic\" serial text.\nNarrative revisions.\nHaggard contended that romances such as \"She\" or \"King Solomon's Mines\" were best left unrevised because \"wine of this character loses its bouquet when it is poured from glass to glass\". However, he made a number of alterations to the \"Graphic\" version of \"She\" before its publication as a novel in 1887. One of the most significant was to the third chapter concerning the sherd, which was substantially expanded from the original to include the tale of Amenartas in uncial and cursive Greek scripts. Facsimile illustrations were also included of an antique vase, made up by Haggard's sister-in-law Agnes Barber to resemble the sherd of Amenartas. A number of footnotes were also included containing historical references by the narrator. Haggard was keen to stress the historicity of the narrative, improving some of the information about geography and about ancient civilisations in Chapters 4, 13, and 17.\nThe 1887 edition of the novel also features a substantially rewritten version of the \"hotpot\" scene in Chapter 8, when Mahomed is killed. In the original serialisation the cannibal Amahagger grow restless and hungry, and place a large heated pot over Mahomed's head, enacting the hotpotting ritual before eating him. Haggard's stories were criticised at the time for their violence, and he toned this scene down, so that Mahomed dies when Holly shoots him accidentally in the scuffle with the Amahagger. Comparing the serial and novel editions of \"She\", Stauffer describes the more compact narrative of the original as a reflection of the intense burst of creativity in which Haggard composed the story, arguing that \"the style and grammar of the \"Graphic\" [edition] is more energetic and immediate\", although, as he noted, it is also \"sometimes more flawed\".\nHaggard continued to revise \"She\" for later editions. The \"New Edition\" of 1888 contains more than 400 minor alterations. The last revision by Haggard was in 1896.\nGenre.\nFantasy and science fiction.\n\"She\" is one of the foundational works of fantasy literature, coming around the time of \"The Princess and the Goblin\" (1858) by George MacDonald, William Morris' \"The Wood Beyond the World\" and \"The Well at the World's End\", and the short stories of Lord Dunsany. It is marked by a strong element of \"the marvelous\" in the figure of Ayesha, a two-thousand-year-old sorceress, and the 'Spirit of the World', an undying fire that confers immortality. Indeed, Haggard's story is one of the first in modern literature to feature \"a slight intrusion of something unreal\" into a very real world \u2013 a hallmark of the fantasy genre. Similarly, the carefully constructed \"fantasy history\" of \"She\" foreshadows the use of this technique that characterises later fantasies such as \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Wheel of Time\" series, and which imparts a \"degree of security\" to the secondary world. However, the story of \"She\" is firmly ensconced in what fantasy theorists call 'primary world reality', with the lost kingdom of K\u00f4r, the realm ruled by the supernatural She, a fantastic \"Tertiary World\" at once directly part of and at the same time indirectly set apart from normative \"primary\" reality. Along with Haggard's prior novel, \"King Solomon's Mines\", \"She\" laid the blueprints for the \"lost world\" subgenre in fantasy literature, as well as the convention of the \"lost race\". As Brantlinger has noted of the novel's importance to the development of the \"secondary world\" in fantasy literature: \"Haggard may seem peripheral to the development of science fiction, and yet his African quest romances could easily be transposed to other planets and galaxies\". In his history of science fiction, \"Billion Year Spree\", Brian Aldiss notes the frequency with which Ayesha's death in the Pillar of Fire has been imitated by later science fiction and fantasy writers: \"From Haggard on, crumbling women, priestesses, or empresses \u2013 all symbols of women as Untouchable and Unmakeable \u2013 fill the pages of many a scientific romance\".\nAdventure romance.\n\"She\" is part of the adventure subgenre of literature which was especially popular at the end of the 19th century, but which remains an important form of fiction to the present day. Along with works such as \"Treasure Island\" (1883) and \"Prince Otto\" (1885) by Robert Louis Stevenson, and Jules Verne's \"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\" (1871) and \"Around the World in Eighty Days\" (1875), \"She\" had an important formative effect on the development of the adventure novel. Indeed, Rider Haggard is credited with inventing the romance of archaeological exploration which began in \"King Solomon's Mines\" and crystallised in \"She\". One of the most notable modern forms of this genre is the \"Indiana Jones\" movie series, as well as the Tarzan novels by Edgar Rice Burroughs and recently Alan Moore's \"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\" (2000). In such fictional narratives the explorer is the hero, with the drama unfolding as they are cast into \"the nostrum of the living past\". Holly and Leo are prototypes of the adventurer, who has become a critical figure in modern fiction.\nImperial Gothic.\n\"She\" is also one of the central texts in the development of Imperial Gothic. Many late-Victorian authors during the \"fin de si\u00e8cle\" employed Gothic conventions and motifs in their writing, stressing and alluding to the supernatural, the ghostly, and the demonic. As Brantlinger has noted, \"Connected to imperialist adventure fiction, these interests often imply anxieties about the stability of Britain, of the British Empire, or, more generally, of Western civilisation\". Novels like \"Dracula\" and \"Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde\" present depictions of repressed, foreign, and demonic forces at the heart of the imperial polity. In \"She\" the danger is raised in the form of Ayesha herself:\nShe's threat to replace Queen Victoria with herself echoes the underlying anxiety over European colonialism emblematic of the Imperial Gothic genre. Indeed, Judith Wilt characterises the narrative of \"She\", in which the penetration into Africa (represented by Holly, Leo, and Job) suddenly suffers a potential \"counter-attack\" (from Ayesha), as one of the archetypal illustrations of the \"reverse colonalism\" motif in Victorian Gothic. Similarly, \"She\" marks one of the first fictional examples to raise the spectre of the natural decline of civilisation, and by extension, British imperial power, which would become an increasingly frequent theme in Gothic and invasion literature until the onset of World War I.\nStyle.\nRider Haggard's writing style was much criticised in reviews of \"She\" and his other works. His harshest critic was Augustus Moore, who wrote: \"God help English literature when English people lay aside their Waverley novels, and the works of Defoe, Swift, Thackeray, Charlotte Bront\u00eb, George Eliot, and even Charles Reade, for the penny dreadfuls of Mr Haggard.\" He added: \"The man who could write 'he spoke to She' can have no ear at all.\" A more common sentiment was expressed in the anonymous review of \"She\" in \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\": \"Mr Rider Haggard is not an exquisite workman like Mr [Robert Louis] Stevenson, but he has a great deal of power in his way, and rougher qualities which are more likely, perhaps, to 'take the town' than skill more delicate.\"\nModern literary criticism has tended to be more circumspect. As Daniel Karlin has noted, \"That Haggard's style is frequently bathetic or clumsy cannot be denied; but the matter is not so easily settled.\" Stauffer cites the passage in which Holly meditates as he tries to fall asleep as emblematic of \"the charges against\" Haggard's writing. In this scene Holly lies down and\nThe passage concludes with a wry remark from Holly: \"I at last managed to get to sleep, a fact for which anybody who reads this narrative, if anybody ever does, may very probably be thankful.\" According to Stauffer, \"the disarming deflation of the passage goes a long way toward redeeming it, and is typical of the winning contradictions of the narrator's style\". Tom Pocock in \"Rider Haggard and the Lost Empire\" has also highlighted the \"literary framework\" that Haggard constructs throughout much of the narrative, referencing Keats, Shakespeare and Classical literature to imbue the story with a \"Gothic sensibility\". Yet as Stauffer notes, \"Ultimately, however, one thinks of Haggard's plots, episodes, and images as the source of his lasting reputation and influence.\"\nThemes.\nImperialism.\n\"She\" is set firmly in the imperialist literature of the late-Victorian period. The so-called \"New Imperialism\" marking the last quarter of the 19th century witnessed a further expansion of European colonies, particularly on the African continent, and was characterised by a seeming confidence in the merits of empire and European civilisation. Thus \"She\" \"invokes a particularly British view of the world\" as Rider Haggard projects concepts of the English self against the foreign otherness of Africa. One example occurs when Holly is first ushered into the presence of Ayesha, walking into the chamber behind a grovelling Billali who warns Holly to follow his example, or \"a surety she will blast thee where thou standest\". \"She\" stresses quintessential British qualities through the \"adventure\" of empire, usually in contrast to foreign barbarism. The notion of imperialism is further compounded by the figure of She, who is herself a foreign colonising force. \"In a sense then\", Stauffer writes, \"a single property line divides the realm of Queen Victoria and that of \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\", two white queens who rule dark-skinned natives of the African continent.\"\nRace and evolution.\nLike many of his Victorian contemporaries, Rider Haggard proceeded \"on the assumption that whites are naturally superior to blacks, and that Britain's imperial extensions into Africa [were] a noble, civilising enterprise\". Although Haggard wrote a number of novels that portray Africans in a comparatively realistic light, \"She\" is not among their number. Even in \"King Solomon's Mines\" the representation of Umbopa (who was based on an actual warrior) and the Kukuanas drew upon Haggard's knowledge and understanding of the Zulus. In contrast, \"She\" makes no such distinctions. Ayesha, the English travellers and the ancient inhabitants of K\u00f4r are all white embodiments of civilisation, while the darker Amahagger, as a people, illustrate notions of savagery, barbarity and superstition. Nonetheless, the \"racial politics of the novel are more complex than they first appear\", given that Ayesha is in origin an ancient Arabian; Leo is descended from, and physically resembles, a blond Hellenistic Greek; and Holly is said to resemble a baboon, an animal that Victorians typically associated with black Africans. Critics such as Wendy Katz, Patricia Murphy and Susan Gubar have discussed what they perceive as a strong racist undercurrent in \"She\", but Andrew takes note of the ways in which \"the novel suggests deeper connections among the races, an ancient genealogy of ethnicities and civilizations in which every character is a hybrid\".\nThere is a strong Darwinian undercurrent framing the representation of race in \"She\", stemming from Haggard's own interests in evolutionary theory and archaeology. In particular, the theme of racial degeneration appears in the novel. Moving into the \"fin de si\u00e8cle\", late Victorians were increasingly concerned about cultural and national decline resulting from racial decay. In \"She\" this evolutionary concept of degeneration is manifested in Ayesha and the Amahagger. Haggard represents the Amahagger as a debased mixture of ethnicities, \"a curious mingling of races\", originally descended from the inhabitants of K\u00f4r but intermarried with Arabs and Africans. Racial hybridisation of any kind \"entailed degeneration\" to Victorians, a \"decline from the pure blood\" of the initial races, and thus \"an aspect of their degeneration is the idea that the Amahagger have lost whatever elements of civilization their K\u00f4r ancestors may have imparted to them\". Ayesha proudly proclaims her own racial purity as a quality to be admired: \"for Arabian am I by birth, even 'al Arab al Ariba' (an Arab of the Arabs), and of the race of our father Y\u00e1rab, the son of Kh\u00e2tan ... of the true Arab blood\". However, Judith Wilt has argued that the novel's starkest evocation of the evolutionary principle occurs in the regressive demise of Ayesha. Stepping into the Pillar of Fire, the immortal She begins to wither and decay, undergoing what Wilt describes as the \"ultimate Darwinian nightmare\": evolution in reverse.\nFemale authority and sexuality.\nWhen Rider Haggard first conceived of \"She\" he began with the theme of \"an immortal woman inspired by an immortal love\". Although ostensibly a romance, the novel is part of the wider discourse regarding women and womanhood in late-Victorian Britain. Many scholars have noted how \"She\" was published as a book in 1887, the year of Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee, and Adrienne Munich argues that Haggard's story \"could fittingly be considered an ominous literary monument to Victoria after fifty years of her reign\". Indeed, in her devotion to Kallikrates (two thousand years after his death), Ayesha echoes the long-lasting fidelity of Victoria to her husband, Albert. However, unlike the \"benign\" Victoria, the question of female authority is realised to the extreme in the figure of \"She-who-must-be-obeyed\", whose autonomous will seemingly embodies Victorian anti-feminist fears of New Women desiring 'absolute personal independence coupled with supreme power over men'. Haggard constantly emphasises this anxiety over female authority in \"She\", so that even the rationally minded and misogynistic Holly, who has put his \"heart away from such vanity as woman's loveliness\", ultimately falls upon his knees and worships Ayesha \"as never woman was worshipped\". Similarly, although the masculine and chivalric Leo is determined to reject Ayesha for killing the devoted native girl Ustane, he too quickly falls under her will. \nIn her role as the seductive \"femme fatale\", Ayesha is part of \"a long tradition of male fantasy that includes Homer's Circe, Shakespeare's Cleopatra, and Keats's 'La Belle Dame sans Merci'\". Brantlinger identifies the theme of \"the white (or at least light-skinned) queen ruling a black or brown-skinned savage race\" as \"a powerfully erotic one\" with its opposite being \"the image of the helpless white woman captured by savages and threatened, at least, with rape\". The figure of She both inspires male desire and dominates male sovereignty, represented in her conquest of the enlightened Victorians Holly and Leo. The two Englishmen embody the powers of manhood, with Leo a reflection of masculine physicality and Holly a representation of man's intellectual strength; but both are conquered by the feminine powers of She, who rules as much through sex-appeal as through sorcery, immortality, and will. Thus Steven Arata describes her as \"the veiled woman, that ubiquitous nineteenth-century figure of male desire and anxiety, whose body is Truth but a Truth that blasts\". Similarly, Sarah Gilbert sees the theme of feminine sexuality and authority realised in Ayesha as critical to the novel's success: \"Unlike the women earlier Victorian writers had idealised or excoriated, She was neither an angel nor a monster. Rather, She was an odd but significant blend of the two types \u2013 an angelically chaste woman with monstrous powers, a monstrously passionate woman with angelic charms\".\nReception.\nAfter its publication in 1887 \"She\" became an immediate success. According to \"The Literary World\" \"Mr. Rider Haggard has made for himself a new field in fiction\". Comparing the novel to \"King Solomon's Mines\" the review declared: \"The book before us displays all the same qualities, and we anticipate for it a similar popularity. There is even more imagination in the later than in the earlier story; it contains scenes of greater sensuous beauty and also of more gruesome horror\". The \"Public Opinion\" was equally rapturous in its praise:\nThe fantasy of \"She\" received particular acclaim from Victorian readers and critics. The review appearing in \"The Academy\" on 15 January was impressed by the \"grown-up\" vision of the novel, declaring \"the more impossible it gets the better Mr. Haggard does it... his astonishing imagination, and a certain \"vraisemblance\" [\"verisimilitude\" (French)] makes the most impossible adventures appear true\". This sentiment was echoed in \"The Queen: The Lady's Newspaper\", with the reviewer pronouncing that \"this is a tale in the hands of a writer not so able as Mr. Haggard might easily have become absurd; but he has treated it with so much vividness and picturesque power as to invest it with unflagging interest, and given to the mystery a port of philosophic possibility that makes us quite willing to submit to the illusion.\n\"The Spectator\" was more equivocal in its appraisal of \"She\". The review described the narrative as \"very stirring\" and \"exciting\" and of \"remarkable imaginative power\", adding: \"The ingenuity of the story... is as subtle as ever romancer invented, and from the day when Leo and Holly land on the coast of Africa, to the day when the Pillar of Fire is revealed to them by the all but immortal 'She-who-must-be-obeyed', the interest of the tale rises higher and higher with every new turn in its course\". However, the review took issue with the characterisation of She and the manner of her demise: \"To the present writer there is a sense of the ludicrous in the end of \"She\" that spoiled, instead of concluding with imaginative fitness, the thread of the impossible worked into the substance of this vivid and brilliantly told story\". Haggard was moved to respond to the criticism of Ayesha's death, writing that \"in the insolence of her strength and loveliness, she lifts herself up against the Omnipotent. Therefore, at the appointed time she is swept away by It... Vengeance, more heavy because more long delayed, strikes her in her proudest part \u2013 her beauty\".\nA number of reviews were more critical of Haggard's work. Although the reviewer of \"She\" in \"Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine\" considered it better than \"King Solomon's Mines\", he opined, \"Mr. Rider Haggard has not proved as yet that he has anything that can be called imagination at all... It might be wrought up into an unparalleled stage effect: but it is rather a failure in pen and ink. The more fearful and wonderful such circumstances are intended to be, the more absurd is the failure of them\". Even more scathing was Augustus Moore in the May edition of \"Time: A Monthly Miscellany\", who declared: \"In Mr Haggard's book I find none of the powerful imagination, the elaborate detail, the vivid English which would entitle his work to be described as a romance... [rather] it seems to me to be the method of the modern melodrama\". Moore was particularly dismissive of the novel's style and prose: \"Mr Haggard cannot write English at all. I do not merely refer to his bad grammar, which a boy at a Boarding School would deserve to be birched for... It can only have been written by a man who not only knew nothing, but cared nothing for 'English undefiled'.\" Haggard's English was a common source of criticisms, but Moore was even dismissive of the character of She who widely garnered universal praise. \"Ayesha\", Moore declares, \"is about as impressive as the singing chambermaid who represents the naughty fairy of a pantomime in tights and a tow wig\". Concluding his review, Moore wondered at the success that had greeted \"She\":\nDespite such criticism, the reception that met \"She\" was overwhelmingly positive and echoed the sentiments expressed by anthropologist and literary critic Andrew Lang before the story's first publication: \"I think \"She\" is one of the most astonishing romances I ever read. The more impossible it is, the better you do it, till it seems like a story from the literature of another planet\".\nModern interpretations.\nFeminist literary historians have tended to define the figure of She as a literary manifestation of male alarm over the \"learned and crusading new woman\". In this view, Ayesha is a terrifying and dominant figure, a prominent and influential rendering of the misogynistic \"fictive explorations of female authority\" undertaken by male writers that ushered in literary modernism. Ann Ardis, for instance, views the fears Holly harbours over Ayesha's plan to return to England as being \"exactly those voiced about the New Woman's entrance in the public arena\". According to the feminist interpretation of the narrative, the death of She acts as a kind of teleological \"judgement\" of her transgression of Victorian gender boundaries, with Ardis likening it to a \"witch-burning\". However, to Rider Haggard, \"She\" was an investigation into love and immortality and the demise of Ayesha the moral end of this exploration:\nIndeed, far from being a radical or threatening manifestation of womanhood, recent academics have noted the extent to which the character of She conforms to traditional conceptions of Victorian femininity; in particular her deferring devotion to Kallikrates/Leo, whom she swears wifely obedience to at the story's climax: \"'Behold!' and she took his [Leo's] hand and placed it upon her shapely head, and then bent herself slowly down till one knee for an instant touched the ground \u2013 'Behold! in token of submission do I bow me to my lord! Behold!' and she kissed him on the lips, 'in token of my wifely love do I kiss my lord'.\" Ayesha declares this to be the \"first most holy hour of completed womanhood\".\nLegacy.\n\"She\" is one of the most influential novels in modern literature. Several authors, including Rudyard Kipling, Henry Miller, Graham Greene, J.R.R. Tolkien and Margaret Atwood, have acknowledging its importance to their own and others' writing. With more than 83 million copies sold, the novel is one of the best-selling fictional works of all time and has been translated into 44 languages. According to Stauffer, \"\"She\" has always been Rider Haggard's most popular and influential novel, challenged only by \"King Solomon's Mines\" in this regard\". The novel is cited in the psychoanalytical theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the latter describing the character of She as a manifestation of the anima figure.\nThe novel has had a lasting impact on the fantasy genre in particular, directly giving rise to the \"lost civilisation\" tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and the creation of mythologised locations such as Shangri-la. Tolkien recognised the importance of \"She\" to his own fantasy works, especially in its foregrounding of a fictional history and narrative. Some scholars have also argued that She may have had a formative influence on Galadriel in \"The Lord of the Rings\": Ayesha's reflecting pool seems to be a direct precursor of Galadriel's mirror. Other characters in Tolkien's Legendarium also seem to have been influenced, including Shelob (who is referred to as \"She\" and \"Her\" in the text), and the escape of the Fellowship of the Ring across the chasm in Moria may be reminiscent of the escape across the chasm near the end of \"She\". Similarly, the \"hot pot\" ritual of Haggard's Amahagger people appears to have been an inspiration or predecessor of the death of Viserys Targaryen in George R. R. Martin's \"A Game of Thrones\"; and Daenerys Targaryen, Cersei Lannister, and especially Melisandre of Asshai, priestess of the god R'hllor, might be seen as characters in the tradition beginning with Ayesha. Indeed, Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha became the prototype of the female antagonist in modern fantasy literature, most famously realised in the figure of the White Witch, Jadis, in C. S. Lewis's \"The Chronicles of Narnia\". \nKor and Ayesha appear in Alan Moore's \"Nemo: Heart of Ice\". The name Ayesha is used in Marvel comics for the female superheroine Ayesha, leader of the Sovereign race, also known as Kismet. Her portrayal in the film \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" 2017 as a beautiful, powerful yet ruthless and cold empress in a grand court recalls Haggard's characterisation of Ayesha.\nAt the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 the H. Jay Smith Exploring Company presented an exhibit of artefacts from the American Southwest featuring objects and human remains of the Basketmaker and Cliff Dweller (Ancestral Puebloan) Cultures. The exhibit featured a mummy that had been preserved naturally by the southwestern climate and that was given the name \"She\".\nAdaptations.\n\"She\" has been adapted for the cinema at least eleven times, beginning with the 1899 short film \"The Pillar of Fire\", directed by Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s, followed by another short film directed by Edwin S. Porter in 1908. An American 1911 version starred Marguerite Snow, a British-produced version appeared in 1916, and in 1917 Valeska Suratt appeared in a production for Fox which is lost. In 1925 a silent film of \"She\", starring Betty Blythe, was produced with the active participation of Rider Haggard, who wrote the intertitles. The film combines elements from all the books in the series.\nA decade later another cinematic version of the novel was released, featuring Helen Gahagan, Randolph Scott and Nigel Bruce. This 1935 adaptation was set in the Arctic, rather than Africa, and depicts the ancient civilisation of the story in an Art Deco style, with music by Max Steiner.\nThe 1965 film \"She\" was produced by Hammer Film Productions, and starred Ursula Andress as Ayesha and John Richardson as her reincarnated love, with Peter Cushing as Holly, Christopher Lee as Billali and Bernard Cribbins as Job.\nA post-apocalyptic film version of the same title, directed by Avi Nesher, was released in the United States in 1985.\nIn 2001 another adaption was released direct to video with Ian Duncan as Leo Vincey, Oph\u00e9lie Winter as Ayesha and Marie B\u00e4umer as Roxane.\nTim McInnerny starred as Holly (renamed Ludwig Holly) with Mia Soteriou as Ayesha and Oliver Chris as Leo in a two-part adaptation on BBC Radio 4's \"Classic Serial\", originally broadcast on 2 July and 9 July 2006.\nIn 2007 a rock-opera/musical version of \"She\" was recorded live at the Wyspianski Theatre, Katowice, Poland by Clive Nolan and was released on DVD. In February 2012 the Nolan version of \"She\" had its first UK performance at the Playhouse in Cheltenham.\nAccording to \"Financial Times\" reviewer James Lovegrove, Juliet E. McKenna's 2012 \"She-who-thinks-for-herself,\" is \"a cunning, funny... feminist rewrite\" of \"She\"."}
{"title": "Dirty_Politics", "label": "Book", "text": "Dirty Politics: How attack politics is poisoning New Zealand\u2019s political environment is a book by Nicky Hager published in August 2014.\nThe book is based on emails hacked from Cameron Slater's Gmail account and on Facebook chats. These communications occurred around the same time that a denial-of-service (DOS) attack took down Slater's website \u2013 the right-wing blog \"Whale Oil Beef Hooked\" \u2013 and feature hundreds of items of correspondence in which prominent New Zealanders are criticised and vilified. Hager's book describes a lengthy history of correspondence between Slater and Justice Minister Judith Collins that eventually contributed to her resignation as a Minister. In response to the allegations in the book, Prime Minister John Key said that he talked to Slater on a regular basis. Hager claimed that using bloggers rather than journalists allowed Key to maintain a friendly public persona, while using right-wing blogs as a vehicle to attack opponents. Other bloggers mentioned in the book include Matthew Hooten, Cathy Odgers ( who goes by the name of Cactus Kate) and David Farrar.\nHowever, Hager reserves his strongest criticism for Cameron Slater, who he says received payment to write attack articles on public figures who opposed or criticised National Party policy \u2013 and \"Dirty Politics\" identifies those who paid him.\nBackground.\nWhale Oil Beef Hooked (generally referred to as WhaleOil) is the personal blog of Cameron Slater which he started in 2005. Slater, the son of former National Party president John Slater, claims WhaleOil is a \"super-blog\" attracting over one million unique visits every month. He admitted at that time to suffering from depression and has a reputation for vitriol and anger. He said in 2010 that he didn't care if people regarded him as 'stupid, a bully, or vicious' but would resent being called a hypocrite.\nIn January 2014, WhaleOil was hacked some time after he posted a blog post with the headline \"Feral dies in Greymouth, did world a favour.\" Three other children in this family had already been killed in accidents and the post provoked a 'furious public reaction'. Some weeks later, Hager received an 8 gigabyte USB stick in the mail containing thousands of pages of emails hacked from Slater's website. Hager contacted the hacker, known as Rawshark, and persuaded him that putting the information in a book would provide \"something more lasting and of bigger value\" than releasing it on Twitter. Hager says Rawshark was motivated by his dislike of Slater, and that he secretly met the hacker in public parks to discuss how the information should be released. He then spent a significant amount of time analysing the content and only published material which he believed was in the public interest. He was careful to avoid releasing sensitive material about Slater and others mentioned in the hacked emails which did not involve a significant public interest.\nProduction.\nThe production, printing, and distribution of the book was done in secret by Craig Potton Publishing. Co-owner of the publishing company, Robbie Burton, said: \"It was one of the great and surreal and scary moments of my publishing career.\" Burton said the secrecy was necessary because they were wary that the book might annoy some people with \"deep pockets\" who \"might be inclined to revenge\". The book was produced very quickly by Craig Potton Publishing, where staff worked on it from Thursday evening to the following Tuesday. Once the book was finished, first it was printed in secret in Wellington, before being shipped back to Nelson and stored in a warehouse, and then finally being sent unannounced to stores around the country.\nRelease.\n\"Dirty Politics\" was released at Unity Books in Wellington on 13 August 2014, with a crowd of approximately 150. Prior to the release of the book, details of what it would be about were the subject of substantial speculation, as the topic of the book was kept secret in order to avoid it being blocked from release by a court injunction.\nFour days after release, it had sold about 10,000 copies, in addition to 1,000 e-book sales. Robbie Burton, executive director of Craig Potton Publishing, said: \"I've never seen anything like this before, in terms of the speed at which it's happening.\" A week after release, sales had reached approximately 15,000, and by mid September, sales were at almost 20,000. The first two chapters are available free on-line.\nTwo weeks after the release of the book, Hager spoke at the four-day biennial Writers &amp; Readers Festival in Christchurch. About 5000 people attended 57 events, one of which was a public discussion called Secrets, Spies and Free Speech featuring \"Dirty Politics\" author Nicky Hager, \"Guardian\" journalist Luke Harding and Australian journalist Richard King. The discussion was mainly about the freedom of speech in Western democracies.\nMain features.\nHager provides numerous incidents of dirty politics in the book. He describes multiple email exchanges between Cameron Slater and National Party spin doctor Jason Ede who works for Prime Minister John Key. Up till August 2011 Mr Ede was employed by Ministerial Services and, in effect, was paid by the taxpayer. Hager says Ede tried to avoid scrutiny by using a 'dynamic' IP address, one that changed frequently making it difficult for him to be identified. When the book was published, Mr Ede was employed by the National Party, rather than by John Key, but was still working from the Prime Minister's office. He resigned the day before the election.\n\"Dirty Politics\" also describes numerous email contacts between Cameron Slater and Judith Collins who are long-time friends. The email records span from 2009 to 2014 covering the entire time she was in Cabinet. One particular email shows that Collins asked Slater to edit her Wikipedia page and sent him a new photo with the message: \"Cam, any chance of a better photo going up?? Eek it looks really bad.\" Slater appears to have obliged using the pseudonym 'Jc press sec', which was subsequently changed to Polkad0t.\nIn return, Slater also asked Collins for favours. The emails indicate Slater asked Ms Collins to get a prisoner moved to a different prison, while she was Minister of Corrections. Slater asked Collins to get him moved because he was friends with the prisoner's ex-wife, who wanted the man moved further away from their daughter who had been visiting him in prison.\nThe more serious allegations in \"Dirty Politics\" are described below. Radio New Zealand political editor Brent Edwards says that while the book is not always definitive,\nThe Labour Party website.\nOne of the main allegations is that during the 2011 election campaign, Cameron Slater and Jason Ede took advantage of a badly-configured website to enter the database of the Labour Party website. This enabled them to look at emails and personal details which were then used to attack the Labour Party. 18,000 emails, lists of the party's donors and supporters and their credit-card transactions were downloaded. The book reveals Mr Slater and Mr Ede both accessed the site more than once and then \"plotted how best to reveal the downloaded material on Mr Slater's blog\". Slater did not deny he had accessed the website in May 2011, and said: \"I was certainly into the backend of the Labour Party's website, if they couldn't manage security of their website, their credit card details and financial information about their membership, well then they weren't really fit for government at the time.\"\nHager alleges that material from the website breach was selectively released by Slater, starting from 12 June.\nIn response to being accused of illegally accessing the Labour website, Slater published a blog post titled \"My confession: How I accessed the Labour Party web site\". In the post, he shows how he claims to have accessed information on four Labour party websites, and denies allegations of \"hacking\". Using easily accessible links, he could view all the files on the web server, including sensitive membership and credit card information which was unencrypted.\nMr Key also claimed there was nothing wrong with Jason Ede accessing the Labour Party website because \"they left their website open.\" He justified the action to Radio New Zealand by saying: \"If the Wallabies on Tuesday night had left their starting line-up up on their website, on their private website, would the All Blacks go and have a look? The answer is yes. The reason I know that is it's happened.\"\nThe Security Intelligence Service.\nAnother allegation is that in 2011, the Prime Minister's office facilitated the release of confidential Security Intelligence Service (SIS) documents to Cameron Slater so he could use them to embarrass Phil Goff. Slater made an Official Information Act (OIA) request to the SIS for confidential documents which confirmed the SIS had briefed Phil Goff about suspected Israeli spies who left the country after the second Christchurch earthquake \u2013 after Goff had said publicly he was not briefed. Slater was given access to documents within 24 hours \u2013 long before other media outlets who had also asked for them. Slater's emails described in \"Dirty Politics\" suggest he knew what was in the documents before they were released and that the OIA would be expedited in unusually quick time. Goff believes this inside information could only have come from the SIS director Warren Tucker or from staff in the prime minister's office.\nAttacks on public servant.\nThe book also presents evidence which suggests that Justice Minister Judith Collins leaked the name of public servant, Simon Pleasants, to Cameron Slater. Pleasants worked in the ministerial property department at Internal Affairs, and Collins assumed he was responsible for leaking details of Mr English's accommodation payments to Labour in 2009. Slater then published a series of blog attacks on Pleasants \u2013 who subsequently received a torrent of abuse including death threats. Pleasants denies ever leaking any information about English.\nNick Bryant, Gerry Brownlee's press secretary is identified in \"Dirty Politics\" as the user of the pseudonym \"Former Hack\" to post anonymous comments on Whaleoil encouraging Cameron Slater's campaign against Pleasants. On 23 August, \"The New Zealand Herald\" reported it was able to confirm the use of Mr Bryant's ministerial computer and subsequently revealed that hundreds of messages were sent from ministerial or government computers to the comments section of Slater's blog. The messages are linked to email addresses on government servers and IP addresses from which they were posted.\nCommercial 'hit' jobs.\n\"Dirty Politics\" also refers to hacked emails which suggest Slater allowed his website to be used for commercial \"hit\" jobs supplied by PR consultant, Carrick Graham, whose clients include tobacco and alcohol companies. For instance, Slater has frequently used his WhaleOil blog to attack Professor Doug Sellman, a leading authority on addiction and an outspoken critic of the alcohol industry posting blogs with pejorative titles such as \u201cConfirmed: Doug Sellman Gone Mad\u201d. These were based on information supplied by Carrick Graham, son of former National party member Sir Douglas Graham. Hager says Carrick Graham's company, Facilitate Communications, paid Slater $6,555 a month and speculated that it was for him to do attack blogs.\nKatherine Rich.\nFormer National MP Katherine Rich, the chief executive of the NZ Food and Grocery Council, is implicated in the book. Emails show that information she passed to Carrick Graham was passed on to Slater. Slater then used the information to attack health campaigners such as Professor Doug Sellman who campaigns about liquor legislation and \"New Zealand Herald\" columnist Wendyl Nissen, who writes about additives and healthy food.\nNew Zealand allows 14 additives that have been banned or never allowed in the European Union or the United States and in her role at the New Zealand Food and Grocery Council, Katherine Rich, has claimed all additives used in New Zealand are safe. Ms Nissen said she was attacked because Katherine Rich objected to her \"highlighting the use of artificial colours commonly used in soft drinks and processed foods and the fact many had been banned in other countries.\" Confirming his connection with Katherine Rich, Slater publicly acknowledged that she had paid him twice, but claimed it was for speaking at conferences not for writing blog articles.\nHowever, in 2012, the National Government appointed Rich to the board of the Health Promotional Agency, which runs campaigns to promote healthier lifestyles. In this capacity, Katherine Rich's primary role is to promote public health, suggesting her involvement with the Food and Grocery Council means she has a conflict of interest. Once the allegations in Dirty Politics became public, a group of 33 scientists and health practitioners were so concerned they wrote to John Key asking him to investigate Rich's apparent conflict of interest.\nGreen Party health spokesperson Kevin Hague said Rich should resign, arguing that \"Katherine Rich, Carrick Graham and Cameron Slater have all been involved in a systematic undermining of health promotion in New Zealand. She cannot tenably remain on the board of that organisation.\" Rich responded by saying she had never been involved in undermining public health and found the claim very offensive. She said she put her heart and soul into the Health Promotion Agency and adhered to all parts of the Crown Entities Act.\nNevertheless, the Auditor-General was asked to investigate and conducted a review of the HPA\u2019s board minutes. It declared \"we have not identified any particular matters before, or decisions by, the HPA board that might raise serious concerns about its management of conflicts of interest\". However, the Auditor-General acknowledged they did not interview Ms Rich, nor did they investigate \"allegations in Nicky Hager\u2019s 2014 book Dirty Politics about things Mrs Rich is said to have done in her private capacity\". Rich said she felt vindicated by the finding, but the Green Party called for an additional investigation by the State Services Commission.\nFurther revelations.\nAttacks on the Serious Fraud Office.\nOn 30 August, John Key released an email written by Slater in 2011 suggesting Judith Collins was also 'gunning' for former Serious Fraud Office (SFO) boss Adam Feely. Collins was the Minister responsible for the SFO at the time, and the email said: \"Any information that we can provide her [Collins] on his [Feely's] background is appreciated.\" It was addressed to 'Mark' (with the surname redacted) and Carrick Graham.\nOther emails, released to Fairfax Media by Rawshark, appear to suggest that 'Mark' is former Hanover Finance director Mark Hotchin. Hotchin secretly paid Slater and another right wing blogger, Cathy Odgers, to write attack posts undermining Feely, the SFO and the Financial Markets Authority while they were investigating the collapse of Hanover Finance in 2011. Slater wrote a series of highly critical blogs about Feely in late 2011.\nRelease of emails on @WhaleDump.\nPrime Minister John Key characterised \"Dirty Politics\" as a \"cynically timed attack\" from \"a well known left wing conspiracy theorist\". In response to Key's criticism that the book's publication so close to the 2014 general election was designed to be a political bombshell, Hager says he published the material that was provided to him in March 2014 as soon as he could. Rather than being timed for maximum political damage, Hager says \"it was actually just the practicalities of how fast I could get it out.\"\nMr Key went on to say the book \"makes all sorts of unfounded allegations and voters will see it for what it is.\" He also accused Nicky Hager of joining \"a whole lot of dots that can't be connected.\" Key said: \"[Hager] didn't do what a true journalist would do. He didn't go and check out the facts, he didn't try and get that side of the story.\"\nIn response, Hager spoke to his source to try to get back some of the emails that the book was based on in order to release them online. The hacker, known as Rawshark, apparently said: \"Leave this to me\" and began releasing the emails through an account on Twitter, @WhaleDump. The emails seem to back up many of the claims Hager makes in the book. The hacker also communicated with journalists using encryption to protect his identity. He denied any political motivation but indicated a desire to \"take down this corrupt network\".\nAfter a series of email releases on the @WhaleDump account, Cameron Slater tried to take out a court injunction to prevent the media from reporting hacked information obtained from his \"Whale Oil\" blog. Media lawyer Julian Miles QC argued on behalf of the media outlets that the information was of huge public interest. High Court Judge John Fogarty agreed but granted an order stopping the hacker, who was an unnamed defendant, from publishing any more \"WhaleDumps\", although media were allowed to publish material they had already received. In his judgement Justice Fogarty said that Slater's case against the hacker was overwhelming and that taking information from his computer was akin to entering someone's private property and taking their private papers. He wrote: \"There is no doubt at all that (Slater) has a serious argument that the unknown hacker has committed a wrong or tort against him, to which the common law will grant such remedies as can be practicably imposed.\"\nOn 4 September, the original @WhaleDump account was suspended by Twitter. Soon afterwards, the hacker Rawshark reopened a Twitter account with the username @Whaledump2. On 5 September, after the release of a number of other documents online, Rawshark announced that he would no longer be releasing any information, tweeting a number of messages:\nImpact.\n\"The New Zealand Herald\" commentator John Armstrong wrote: \"Hager's allegations are many and varied. They are extremely serious.\" Armstrong points to the allegation of the involvement of National Party personnel in hacking into the Labour Party database as the most serious, and draws parallels with the Watergate scandal. David Cunliffe, leader of the Labour Party, also describes the events portrayed in the book as akin to Watergate.\nThe revelations in \"Dirty Politics\" have also been reported in international media. Under the headline \"New Zealand's own House of Cards is collapsing\", \"The Guardian\" newspaper said \"New Zealanders are currently witnesses to an expos\u00e9 of unprecedented proportions.\" Also in \"The Guardian\", New Zealand journalist Toby Manhire wrote: \"\"Dirty Politics\" has blown the National party (election) strategy dramatically off course, propelling the campaign into uncharted territory. Its allegations have dominated news bulletins for the 10 days since its publication, as accusations of dirty tricks, smear campaigns and conspiracy sally in every direction.\" In addition to the calls for Judith Collins to resign, Manhire suggested that John Key's \"sparkling reputation\" may be \"contaminated by association with Slater\u2019s toxic style.\"\nCameron Slater subsequently laid a complaint with the police about the illegal hacking of his emails, and made a separate complaint with the Privacy Commissioner over the release of the email by the Prime Minister.\nResignations.\nJudith Collins.\nCollins had been under pressure to resign earlier in the year over her involvement with Chinese officials at Oravida. Once \"Dirty Politics\" was published and Collins' alleged treatment of public servant Simon Pleasants came to light, there were renewed calls for her resignation. The Public Service Association said her actions breached an important constitutional principle and \"Minister Collins must take responsibility for her actions and resign.\" Labour Leader David Cunliffe said Mr Key should fire Ms Collins, \"because she has acted in a way that is unbecoming and unfit\" for a minister. Deputy Prime Minister Bill English distanced himself from her behaviour by saying \"it's not a style I like\". John Key called her \"unwise\" but refused to take any action.\nAs the pressure on Collins mounted, she avoided the media entirely for a few days. Then on 23 August she fronted up but refused to answer questions about her friendship with Mr Slater. She declared she had no plans to resign and refused to acknowledge her behaviour was damaging the National Party in any way. A week later right wing blogger, Cathy Odgers, apparently sent the damning email to John Key's office in which Slater said Collins was 'gunning' for Adam Feely. Fairfax Media journalist Matt Nippert, who was investigating the hacked emails, believes that Odgers thought Nippert was about to expos\u00e9 the connection between Slater, Collins and Feely. He says Odgers panicked and \"alerted the Beehive to what may have been coming.\" John Key called a press conference the next day, Saturday 30 August 2014, at which Collins resigned as a minister.\nIn October, the Prime Minister announced that Collins would not be allowed to use the title 'Honourable' before her name unless she is cleared by the inquiry into her behaviour. Collins was reported to be 'appalled' and 'seething' that she heard about this decision through the media rather than being told personally by Mr Key.\nJason Ede.\nJason Ede was a central figure in \"Dirty Politics\". Hager said Ede drafted Official Information Act requests on Slater's behalf and was frequently in contact with the blogger about ways to discredit the Labour Party. After the book's release, Ede entirely avoided the media. Slater subsequently described him as \"squeamish\" and \"gutless\" for going to ground rather than talking to the media about their relationship.\nEde resigned from his position as a media researcher for the National Party the day before the election. Announcing his resignation after 11 years \"loyal service to the National Party\", John Key said:\nBlogger David Farrar said he thought Ede had resigned voluntarily and not due to the book's publication. However, Hager said he was sceptical about the reasons behind Ede's departure:\nInspector General inquiry into the release of SIS information.\nOn 1 September, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, Cheryl Gwyn, announced she would conduct an \"in-depth and robust inquiry\" in response to claims that details of a briefing between the head of the SIS with former Labour leader Phil Goff were given to Cameron Slater. Gwyn promised a comprehensive investigation saying: \"The scale of the inquiry is significant \u2013 it involves access to a variety of IT systems, documents, phone records and so forth. I then need to analyse that information, discard what is irrelevant, and then take into account the evidence from those summoned.\" She said the inquiry was in \"recognition of public interest\" that the SIS may have been used for political purposes.\nThe results on the inquiry were released on 25 November 2014 three months later. Ms Gwyn found that the SIS gave information to John Key's office from where his deputy chief of staff Phil de Joux passed it on to another John Key employee, Jason Ede. Mr Ede contacted Cameron Slater and they then discussed how an Official Information Act request for the information should be worded. Slater emailed the request while they were still talking on the phone and also provided Slater with draft blog posts attacking Mr Goff. Cameron Slater subsequently used the information to attack former Labour leader, Phil Goff, on his blog.\nMs Gwyn concluded that former SIS director Warren Tucker provided \"incomplete, inaccurate and misleading information\" to Cameron Slater and to Prime Minister John Key and failed to take adequate steps to maintain the agency's political neutrality. In the process, Ms Gwyn said \"the SIS had effectively delivered Mr Slater an exclusive story while denying other media the same information.\"\nThe report went on to say that Warren Tucker \"having released inaccurate information that was predictably misinterpreted, the then director of the service had a responsibility to take positive steps to correct the interpretation\", but failed to do so. Gwyn further said that \"These errors resulted in misplaced criticism of the then-Leader of the Opposition, Hon Phil Goff MP\". Ms Gwyn recommended that current SIS director, Rebecca Kittredge should apologize to Mr Goff on behalf of the SIS. After reading the report, Ms Kitteridge went a step further and apologised to the new Labour leader, Andrew Little, and Prime Minister John Key as well.\nIn a blog post responding to the release of the inquiry's findings, Hager wrote that:\nHe finishes his blog post by noting that many of the other components of \"Dirty Politics\" have yet to be investigated fully:\nInquiry into Collins &amp; SFO.\nThere were also calls for a wide ranging inquiry into the National party's dealings with Cameron Slater. Labour's finance spokesman, David Parker, described the revelations in \"Dirty Politics\" as \"just the tip of the iceberg\" and laid a formal complaint with Police into allegations that Judith Collins perverted the course of justice. David Cunliffe said there should be a commission of inquiry into all National Ministers' dealings with Slater. Greens Party co-leader Metiria Turei said there should be a Royal Commission. Winston Peters said a full Royal Commission of Inquiry would be a bottom line in any negotiations by New Zealand First in the formation of a government after the election.\nThe Prime Minister agreed to an inquiry but limited its scope to only one issue \u2013 the allegations that Collins undermined the Director of the Serious Fraud Office, Adam Feeley in 2011. He appointed former High Court judge Lester Chisholm to conduct the inquiry. David Cunliffe felt this was an inadequate response and said Labour should be consulted on the terms of reference for the inquiry: \"There is a well embedded constitutional convention that requires the Prime Minister to consult with the leader of the opposition this close to an election on a matter this serious. I would expect to be consulted on the terms of reference.\" Key refused to consult Labour over the terms saying \"We're not going on a witch hunt.\"\nOn 25 November 2014, the inquiry released its findings that although there were two independent efforts to undermine former Serious Fraud Office chief Executive Adam Feeley, there was no evidence that Collins participated. However, Judge Chisholm had quite limited access to Slater's accomplices or to relevant information. He only interviewed two of the five people who were party to the email that led to Ms Collins' resignation \u2013 Cameron Slater and Carrick Graham. He didn't talk to Hanover boss Mark Hotchin or Hong Kong-based blogger Cathy Odgers. Chisholm also had no access to Ms Collins' Facebook communications which she deleted in 2013. He also did not have access to her parliamentary landline calls or to cell phone calls from Slater to her. Justice Chisholm noted that \"The absence of telephone records for Mr Slater's calls is surprising given that both Ms Collins and Mr Slater confirmed that they phoned each other often.\"\nNevertheless, Collins felt vindicated and said:\nIn regards to Collins' relationship with Cameron Slater, she said he remained a \"family friend\", although she felt \"incredibly let down\" by him.\nOn opinion polls prior to the 2014 election.\nAlthough it was difficult to gauge the New Zealand public's views on the contents of \"Dirty Politics\", Television New Zealand's Vote Compass tool provided a rough indication. Based on over 13,000 responses up to 25 August 2014, Vote Compass suggests that 33% thought there was \"none\" or \"little\" truth to the claims in the book, 49% said there \"some\" or \"a lot\" of truth, and 18% didn't know. In terms of the effect of the book on voting intentions, 56% said it wouldn't have an effect, 15% said it would have a \"little\" effect, 11% \"some\", 10% \"a lot\", and 8% said they didn't know. There is also some evidence to suggest that the number of people who believed the book's claims had grown over time.\nA number of polls were held during the intense publicity surrounding \"Dirty Politics\" and showed the National Party losing support. Towards the end of August 2014, two weeks after the release of the book, National was still way ahead at 50.8%, but down 4.3% on previous figures. John Key also lost ground as preferred prime minister. The Radio New Zealand Poll of Polls (an arithmetical average of the four most recent major polls) showed National had slid below 50% to 49.1% as at 29 August.\nThe Prime Minister frequently tried to deflect media interest from \"Dirty Politics\" arguing that most people were more interested in other election issues. Once Judith Collins resigned, three polls including the \"Herald\" DigiPoll survey, all showed National support had gone back up to 50% while Labour continued to drop. At his first campaign appearance in the Epsom electorate on 6 September, Key said the polls were showing the public had moved on. \"New Zealand Herald\" columnist John Armstrong noted that Collins was pushed into resigning and said: \"When Key sacked Judith Collins, the headlines screamed 'National in chaos'. In fact, removing Collins was the vital first move in getting National's campaign back on track. Hager's book looks like having no material impact on the outcome of the election.\"\nOn the 2014 election.\nJohn Key's National Party was re-elected to government after it received 47.04% of the party vote in the September 2014 general election. Judith Collins retained her seat in Papakura, but her winning margin over the Labour candidate was cut by half \u2013 from 9890 in the 2011 election to 5,119 in 2014. After the election, Collins was not reinstated to a ministerial position, and was relegated to the backbenches.\nPolitical journalist Andrea Vance commented that \"Dirty Politics didn't hurt National \u2013 in fact, all the evidence points to a lift. But it did harm Labour.\" Labour leader David Cunliffe commented that the focus on \"Dirty Politics\" and spying on New Zealanders had actually hurt the left: \"You would think the impact would be on the Government party responsible, but the reality is that if one is not able to get the airtime because others are dominating it, that impacts the opposition as well\". Cameron Slater blogged that \"Dirty Politics\" had no impact on the election \"because New Zealanders simply don't care\".\nOn John Key's integrity.\nThroughout the weeks that the allegations of \"Dirty Politics\" swirled in the media, Prime Minister John Key tried to swat them away claiming Nicky Hager was little more than \"a screaming left-wing conspiracy theorist\". After National won the 2014 election, Key continued with this dismissive approach once MPs returned to Parliament. When asked by Green party leader, Russel Norman, how many times he had spoken to or texted Cameron Slater, Key replied \"Never in my capacity as Prime Minister\". An editorial in the \"New Zealand Herald\" said this \"revealed a cavalier disregard for the accountability and integrity of his office.\" After Key denied Judith Collins the right to be called the 'Honourable', despite other Cabinet members resigning in disgrace and keeping the title, even Cameron Slater thought this reflected badly on Mr Key. Describing Mr Key's decision as a 'silly mistake' he said: \"Starting off the term with an arrogant and petulant act like that is unbecoming and foreshadows ill-will dogging him in this term.\"\nKey's integrity took another hit after release of the report by Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Cheryl Gwyn into the release of information by SIS director, Warren Tucker. Despite the revelations in Gwyn's report, Key claimed no one in his office had done anything wrong and refused to apologise to Mr Goff. \"New Zealand Herald\" columnist John Armstrong described the report as \"hugely embarrassing\" and said: \"The Key administration has plumbed new depths of arrogance and contempt for the notion of politicians being accountable for their actions\". Fairfax political journalist Andrea Vance wrote in response to the inquiries' findings that Key takes \"hands-off to a disturbing extreme\". She further wrote: \"It stretches credibility to suggest Key \u2013 and his chief of staff Wayne Eagleson \u2013 bear no responsibility for the conduct of de Joux and Ede.\"\nA few days later, Mr Key had to admit in Parliament that he had been communicating with Cameron Slater by text about Gwyn's report prior to its release. Given that Slater is perceived, in John Armstrong's words, as \"the second most-despised figure in New Zealand politics\" (after Kim Dotcom), parliamentarians and media commentators were surprised that Key was still in touch with him. Armstrong said by acknowledging his links with Slater, Key \"compromised his assurance that he had no knowledge of the dirty tricks operation\". Bryce Edwards said that Key could not afford to cut ties with Slater \"out of fear of what could happen if Slater became his enemy\". Matthew Hooten said this could lead to John Key's 'downfall' as he \"risks Cameron Slater going off the deep-end and revealing the full extent of his relationship with the Prime Minister himself, the Prime Minister's Office, with a number of John Key's ministers, with a fair bunch of the backbenchers, and with some senior party officials\".\nOn democracy &amp; perceptions of corruption.\nIn his column in the \"New Zealand Herald\", Dr Bryce Edwards, lecturer in political studies at Otago University, expressed concern about the impact of \"Dirty Politics\" on the public's confidence in public institutions and the integrity of governance. He said the official reports in response to the inquiries generated by the book should serve as a \"wake-up call\" about the health of New Zealand democratic process. In the \"National Business Review\", Rob Hosking, supports this view writing: \"The plain fact is, the country's security service got caught up in the political games of election 2011. Willfully or accidentally, it became a political arm of the party in power and not, as it should be, a neutral government agency.\"\nIn his column, Vernon Small warns that spindoctors are acquiring too much political sway and see their main job as being to protect the Government from the Opposition.\nOn science and public health.\nObesity expert, Dr Boyd Swinburn, Professor of Population Nutrition and Global Health at the University of Auckland, says dirty politics and conflicts of interest in government appointments are having a detrimental impact on Public health. Swinburn said when Tony Ryall appointed former National MP Katherine Rich to the Health Promotion Agency (HPA) in 2012, he ignored an 'irreconcilable conflict of interest' \u2013 Rich is chief executive of the Food and Grocery Council, which lobbies for the alcohol, tobacco and grocery-food industries, whereas the primary responsibility of the HPA is to improve the health of New Zealanders.\nDr Swinburn also believes the views of scientists are being suppressed by attack campaigns driven by large commercial interests in New Zealand. He points to Tony Ryall's dismissal of a letter from more than 30 senior public-health experts calling for an investigation of Rich's role on the HPA board.\nPolice investigation into the identity of the hacker.\nRaid on Hager's home.\nIn October 2014, five police officers went to Nicky Hager's home with a search warrant and spent ten hours looking for information. The alleged purpose of the search was to try to find out the identity of the hacker Rawshark, who hacked into Cameron Slater's computer to obtain the emails and other material on which \"Dirty Politics\" was based. They took away computers, hard-drives, phones, CDs, an iPod and a camera. Police told Hager he is a witness, rather than a suspect of the inquiry. Hager said: \"It seems like a very strange level of resources just for a witness.\" Stuff noted that similar raids had not been made on National Party staffer, Jason Ede, who allegedly hacked into the Labour Party website.\nSuccessful legal challenge of raid.\nIn response to the police search, a legal defence fundraiser for Hager was set up on the website Give A Little by former Young Labour leader Meg Bates, who described Hager as a \"hero\" who \"exposed a twisted web of power and influence in New Zealand politics\". As at April 2016, over $65,000 had been donated to the fund, despite attempts to shut it down and criticism from Slater's sympathisers.\nAnother legal defence fundraiser was set up by the Freedom of the Press Foundation. In an article publicising the fundraiser at \"The Intercept\" and detailing the police raid on Hager's house, Glenn Greenwald and Ryan Gallagher wrote that the raid could have been partially motivated by a desire to investigate whether Hager had received any information from the NSA leaks. As at 18 November, the Foundation fundraiser had raised over $21,000.\nA legal team led by Julian Miles QC, media lawyer Steven Price, and barrister Felix Geiringer gathered round Nicky Hager, who is seeking a judicial review of the police action. Steven Price said \"Our case will be that the police didn't properly consider Nicky Hager's right to protect his confidential sources\". Commenting on the case, law professor Ursula Cheer said: \"We've never really had a case like this before and we've never really had any of these (public interest) issues tested.\"\nOn 30 October 2014, it was reported that an updated edition of John Roughan's biography \"John Key: Portrait of a Prime Minister\" had a new chapter on the election which mentioned that John Key claimed to have been told the identity of the hacker Rawshark. He did not pass the name on to the author of the biography. Asked by reporters about the comment and whether he given the information to the police, a spokesperson for Key said that while he thought he knew the identity of the hacker, \"he cannot be certain\". The spokesperson also said that Key had no involvement in the police inquiry.\nIn December 2015, the High Court in Wellington declared the warrant used to search Hager's house \"fundamentally unlawful\". The judge criticised the police saying the way detectives went about obtaining the warrant was \"not the type of facilitation that I consider the Search and Surveillance Act anticipates\".\nIn March 2016, Hager travelled to the High Court in Auckland to collect belongings taken by police during the search in October 2014. His belongings were in a sealed container at the High Court awaiting the outcome of the legal challenge. Police also destroyed a hard drive which contained copies of Hager's data. Hager commented that:\nOn 12 June 2018, Hager accepted an apology and compensation for \"substantial damages\" from the New Zealand Police for the 2014 raid on his home during the investigation into the hacking that led to the \"Dirty Politics\" book. The settlement also included the police acknowledging that they had accessed Hager's personal banking data.\nOn the media.\nAfter the police raid on Nicky Hager's house, the Labour Party's acting leader, David Parker, pointed out that journalists have a right to protect their sources, and said there was a growing number of cases in which the police were being called in to investigate the media. He said the police had searched media offices after Mr Key's \"teapot tapes\" conversation with John Banks and the Serious Fraud Office had demanded the \"National Business Review\" hand over documents related to the collapse of South Canterbury Finance. Parker argued that the search of Nicky Hager's house amounted to intimidation and said: \"If the media are not free of undue intrusion by state agencies, or have too cosy a relationship with political parties; they cannot do what the fourth estate is meant to do.\" In an editorial, the \"New Zealand Herald\" agreed and said the police raid over such a minor crime was \"not a good look for the police\". The editorial went on to say: \"The effect of such raids is to intimidate such people from approaching media to disclose uncomfortable truths.\"\nIn reviews of political events in 2014, numerous commentators emphasised the impact of Dirty Politics. The New Zealand Herald's David Fisher named Nicky Hager as a finalist for New Zealander of the Year. Russell Brown said #dirtypolitics was \"Word of the Year 2014\". Martin Bradbury criticised John Key for his involvement with Cameron Slater but also took aim at the media for their part in dirty politics arguing that \"many of these media outlets also worked hand in glove with National's black ops team.\" Andrew Geddis challenged the Sunday Star Times for giving Judith Collins a bi-weekly column (once she resigned from cabinet), arguing the paper was essentially choosing money over 'ethical concerns'. Reviewing these various commentaries, Bryce Edwards said: \"There is a growing call for the so-called 'Dirty Politics cast' of politicians and activists to be shunned by the media.\""}
{"title": "Koolaids:_The_Art_of_War", "label": "Book", "text": "Koolaids: The Art of War is a novel by Rabih Alameddine, an author and painter who lives in both San Francisco and Beirut. He grew up in the Middle East, in Kuwait and Lebanon. Published in 1998, \"Koolaids\" is Alameddine's first novel. The majority of the story takes place in San Francisco and Beirut, the sites of two very different \"wars\". San Francisco from the mid-1980s into the 1990s is the main site of the AIDS epidemic, especially among the gay community, while Beirut is the site of a brutal civil war.\nPlot summary.\nThe novel deals with issues such as the AIDS epidemic, sex, the Lebanese civil war, death, and the meaning of life. It is a postmodern novel told from the point of view of numerous narrators. \"Koolaids\" breaks from the traditional novel style in that the whole book is a non-linear narrative. \"Koolaids\" is written in a creative style, with short paragraphs and sentences that have deep meanings. In fact, the whole novel is a series of short sections, or vignettes. Each vignette is part of a stream of consciousness from one of the multiple narrators. The different types of vignettes include diary entries, e-mails, newspaper articles, holy texts/prayers, and dialogues to name a few. Also, there is a multitude of characters who make quick appearances in different spots throughout the novel. The randomness and fragments of thought add to the overall theme of chaos, and the meaninglessness of everything in life. The main sub-themes of the novel are death, AIDS, war, art, and violence. The novel also offers narratives on the inadequate representation of the realities of AIDS and the Lebanon civil war in the mass media. Alameddine achieves this by citing fictional examples told from the first person point of view on the exploitation of the sick and the disregard for human life in war. These examples help reflect the insufficiency of monolithic narratives of AIDS and war. Often, people's harrowing personal experiences are not accounted for in the news or in history books. Alameddine's central purpose for this novel is to portray the meaninglessness of life and to show that the only thing that is certain in life is death.\nCharacters.\nIn \"Koolaids\", Rabih Alameddine includes numerous characters that are connected through a series of short narrations. There are four main narrators, Mohammad, Samir, Samir's mother, and Kurt, that the readers are introduced to. The narrations seem to be laid out sporadically because Alameddine alternates between each of these four, and they are not given in chronological order. He also includes several subplots and various vignettes. Although the narrators are the main characters of the book, there are several dialogues in which celebrities interact with gods from other cultures. These correspond to the randomness of the passages well. A recurring trend with most of the characters is that they die throughout the course of this novel; the main causes of death being AIDS or the violence of the war. None of Alameddine's characters have ever existed, and as a confirmation, the author did state, \u201cI anticipate readers who will imagine characters herein to correspond to real persons. They do not. Everything is a creation of my twisted imagination\u201d (vii).\nCharacters in Dialogues.\nThese dialogues between famous people from different cultures take place four different times throughout the novel. In each of these dialogues, there are six characters that appear every time, Arjuna, Krsna, Eleanor Roosevelt, Krishnamurti, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, and Tom Cruise. Other characters that are seen in these dialogues are Jesus, Mame Dennis, and Jalaleddine Rumi. The main theme of each of these dialogues is the search for the meaning of life. Before each of the dialogues, the same phrase appears, \"\u201cAn hour later. Arjuna and his charioteer, Krsna, on the battlefield. They are now joined by Eleanor Roosevelt, Krishnamurti, Julio Cort\u00e1zar, and Tom Cruise, who looks a little lost\u201d\" (37).\nOther Important Characters.\nIn no particular order:\nThemes &amp; Motifs.\nDeath.\nThe novel centers around wars in Lebanon as well as the AIDS epidemic in the United States, two fronts where death occurs on a regular basis. Alameddine talks about death in various ways, describing the deathbeds of those suffering from AIDS as well as the sometimes instant deaths of those in Lebanon. Alameddine talks about death in his novel often in peculiar ways, which is similar to the peculiar set up of the book. For instance, in three different cases Alameddine writes about death in very different ways. \"I am back in Beirut. In a stable, hiding. He asks me what I am doing. I tell him I killed him. He is lying on the ground, dead. We both look at his body\" (p.\u00a075). In this vignette, which is almost a complete tangent, like many of the vignettes throughout the story are, the narrator has a dream in which he kills his father. This surreal experience is not uncommon throughout the book, nor is its correlation to death. The narrator seems to be almost fascinated at the sight of his dead father's body and the experience seems to be treated lightly. Often Alameddine treats situations of death with humor. This can be seen on page 158 where the narrator talks about a poem he wanted to write on his deathbed and then makes a comment about how he is unable to because he could not write as good as thirteenth century writer Jalaleddine Rumi. Another notion of death touched on in the novel is the idea of the living dead. On page 95 there is a vignette about an AIDS patient with a brainstem issue, with the narrator saying \"Brain stem, you say? By that definition Juan should have been declared dead long before he even got to the hospital\". Again on page 159 a similar scenario comes up. \"Kurt was snoring. I sat next to his bed. I did not want to disturb him. He looked dead already. He opened his eyes suddenly.\" In these two quotes Alameddine brings up the idea of death as a subjective topic. In a way Alameddine lets the reader decide, or at least stokes the fires of debate as to what death means scientifically, emotionally, and otherwise. It seems that in Alameddine's eyes death is not something determined by doctors, but can come sooner and often does. Another mention of death in the novel comes in the form of the four horsemen of the apocalypse from the book of revelation. The four horsemen take part in several dialogues throughout the book which at times are humorous, another look at Alameddine's sometimes comedic take on the subject.\nAIDS vs. War.\nThe two major settings in Alameddine's novel are Lebanon and San Francisco, both of which were facing distinct cultural crises at the time being described in the novel. Lebanon was ravished with civil war while San Francisco was ravished with the AIDS epidemic. Throughout the novel certain parallels are made but the author also makes a point to let the reader know that the problems happen in both places. More specifically, he makes it known that AIDS and issues with homosexuality affect people in Lebanon and the war affects people outside of the war zone. One very important comparison that Alameddine makes throughout the book is the idea of control in regards to AIDS and Lebanon. With the AIDS patients the reader is taken through the sickness and the complete loss of control that the patients face with their bodies basically shutting down from within. This is eerily similar to the loss of control that the citizens of Lebanon face as their country is divided from within while outside forces like Syria and Israel take advantage of their situation much like the virus and consequent illnesses that actually end up killing the patients.\nSex.\nThe relation of sex to danger and violence, whether it be through the war in Lebanon or through AIDS is ever present throughout the book. The first sexual experience that we read about is Samir's loss of virginity, which is not only graphic but uses language illustrating painful sex. In the garage of the apartment building, described as \"dark, damp, and putrid\" (15) and Samir \"felt a wet finger penetrate him. It felt uncomfortable.\" (15) Georges tells Samir that \"he is a natural\" and Samir repeats, \"I like it. I try to help him, but it gets too painful\" (15). As Georges climaxes \"the sound of gunfire erupts again\" (15). The scene conjures the image of a boy living everyday life in a conflicted environment. In physical pain from the penetration but excited at what is happening with Georges, he doesn't quite know what to so but is learning as he goes. The gunfire being simultaneous with Georeges's orgasm is significant of the war being ever present. Samir then runs upstairs to watch the war from the roof and is almost struck by a bullet flying at his crotch. It could have been about to hit him anywhere, but the author chooses to have it almost strike him there. Inevitably this reference is linked to the sex moments earlier, calling to question if the author's statement is about gay sex being unsafe at this time, like dodging a bullet. If the author is discussing sex between gay men as dangerous it is because of the danger of having sex in relation to the AIDS epidemic. The epidemic was random in terms of who lived and who died, kind of like war. Survival in relation to the disease and the war was a matter of luck, not based on precautions or actions.\nWhen Mohammad meets Scott he had a thing for him and desires him greatly. He takes him to his art studio and shows him his paintings. Watching as Scott was admiring his work Mohammad says that \"the scene was turning him on\" (13) but Scott starts talking and describing the painting, relating to Mohammad's life, so he no longer wanted to have sex; in fact they \"never fucked, ever\" (13). However, Mohammad loves Scott more than anyone in the world and Scott's last words were of his love for Mohammad. In this instance of intense love we see desire but then no sex. Alalmeddine is perhaps implying that relationships, of the most significant kind, are about more than sex, and that sex is in fact not necessary in a deep loving relationship. \nThe one straight sexual relationship the we read of is in the context of an affair in Lebanon between a powerful political figure's wife and a warlord. She falls in love with him and he seems to love her, but still the war and violence is the theme of their relationship and sex. At one point they are lying in bed and she feels a gun under the pillow, and he tells her that he has many more guns. He takes five and lays them on her stomach and says she has to take one. With the loaded gun he \"massages her\" (181) and \"the barrel penetrates...he explores with the gun...he looks into her eyes. She is his\" (181). When she points the gun at his head he smiles and performs fellatio on the gun. Then \"she looks into his eyes. He is hers...she orgasms\" (181). This scene is again, like the loss of virginity scene, dangerous and has conflicting images but still expresses love. The fact that they are using a loaded gun as a sex toy can speak to the questionable aspect of the affair, the pretenses of their love; or just that he is a warlord depending on one's reading of the scene. Regardless, even in heterosexual sex we see the link between violence and sex.\nIf ever there was a doubt to the narrator's intentions we are given a quote by Norman Mailer saying, \"There is nothing safe about sex. There never will be\" (178). Linking sex to the dangers of AIDS, not just war, there is a scene in which the narrator walks to the Badlands to find someone to have sex with and \"walked out with a boy...took him home and fucked him silly\" (176). Just the notion of going to find a random person to have sex with is risky, but in the novel it coincides with the culture. The use of the word \"fuck\"as opposed to \"make love\" or \"have sex\" makes the act purely physical and takes the emotion out of it. The next morning the boy wakes up and realizes he has slept with an HIV-positive man and gets really upset, saying that he did not know. In an act of defiance, the narrator goes to the tattoo parlor and has an \"HIV+\" tattooed on his chest, so that \"now no one can claim [he] never told them\" (177). \"Art News\" asked him to pose for a picture of the tattoo thinking that it was an artistic statement. This example of confusion and repercussion gives the reader incite into the domination of the disease on daily life. Furthermore, we are shown an example of how the outside community cannot understand the struggles of a gay man with AIDS, even when he attempts to make it very clear.\nArt.\nArt in the novel illustrates the struggle with AIDS, a community, and a means of identity. Perhaps the simplest connection to AIDS is in the fear of death and the creation of immortality. As an artist, one can be remembered, leaving something physical behind that will be protected or kept. Samir visits Mohammad and Scott and is inspired by Mo (a nickname given to him by other characters that he dislikes) and paints a portrait of their friend Juan, who just died (140). He then paints Steve, who also just died (140). By painting people who have just died, the painter preserves the subject. Regardless of the quality, the paintings are a tribute to their memory. Scott acknowledges this ability in art and asks Mo to use his ashes in a painting specifically so that he may be immortal (103). He is not only going to carry on through an image but knows that people will look at a painting of him and it will most likely be appreciated and never destroyed. In asking for his ashes on canvas, he will be able to actually physically remain a part of people's lives. Granted, this is a hard task for Mo, who ultimately paints his best friend into a peaceful lotus blossom. Scott epitomizes the theory behind using art as a refuge and as preserving oneself. Art is a part of Kurt's death wish as well when he asks Mo to take his paintings. He says \"I know they're not worth much. You can take them while I go on my trip\" (140). Kurt, lying on his death bed, leaves his work to Mo, who is his lover, but also in the same situation. As a part of the gay art community, Mo knows that Kurt means he cannot take his paintings after he dies, but that he wants them to remain somewhere. Through looking at the fact that the characters of the art community think about where there art will end up after their death gives the feeling that perhaps while alive they were thinking of the same thing, that to an extent the art could preserve them.\nRegarding the art community, there is a whole community of characters with shared experiences who all either paint or attend shows and exhibitions and admire each other's artwork. The community provides a place to express emotion, meet peers, and reconcile life to an extent. Samir goes to one of Mohammad's exhibits in DC with his lover Mark and is the only one to understand the subjects of the paintings. He tells the art dealer that he has never seen Mohammad's abstract paintings, but the dealer is confused because the thinks that these paintings are abstract. Samir replies \"but they are the sides of our houses...he painted them beautifully\" (101). He says that \"he had captured Lebanon\" (101). Mohammad jokingly is upset with Samir for ruining his secret but is also excited to have found someone to relate to. The scene shows first, that the community developed through art and second, another way in which art is used. These pictures are not preserving a dead friend's memory, but they are preserving Mohammad and Samir's war-torn homeland without violence involved. Through the exhibit scene, one is shown again the ignorance of an outside culture looking in by the viewers' willingness to assume that the pictures were abstract as opposed to merely asking for a description, which Mohammad says no one did.\nArt is also used to show acceptance and exclusion in society. On pages 48 to 49, Mohammad is describing showing a picture to his father who asks him \"how come you always draw men...come back and show me when you have drawn some women (49).\" Mohammad follows his father's advice and eagerly draws a copy of Goya's \"Nude Maja\". He does not know how to draw the face and decides to improvise, and then returns to show his father. His father slaps him because the face looks like Mohammad's mother. Mohammad is called a pervert by his father at age seven for his attempt to replicate a painting and using his own concepts of reality to create his artwork. Later his painting sold for $300,000 and was titled \"My Mother as the Nude Maja\". Almadene gives a character who uses classic art and makes it his own but is rejected for it. One sees Mohammad's inability to really own a shared culture without being critiqued, as well as sexuality again affecting Mohammad negatively.\nStyle and Structure.\n\"Koolaids\" is a very complicated novel both stylistically and in terms of its structure. The book is divided into a series of vignettes that are presented in a seemingly disjointed manner that serves to reflect the great chaos brought by the Lebanese Civil War and the AIDS epidemic. The main vignettes deal with the main characters such as Mohammed and Samir, but there are many others that introduce, and reintroduce characters creating a disjointed reading experience not found in many novels. Many of these small episodes do not even deal with tangible characters but rather figments of one of the other characters' imagination. Other times the vignettes contain detailed accounts of personas, such as the lovers from opposite sides of the conflict in Beirut, who persistently remain unidentified. The reader really does not get a true idea of how all the scenes relate to each other until the end of the book and no more new information is being presented.\nStream of Consciousness.\nThe novel, though stylistically unique, has very much in common with the modernist literary style Stream of Consciousness, pioneered by authors such as James Joyce, William Faulkner, and Virginia Woolf. Stream of consciousness is effectively an unending interior monologue that tries to portray the constant thought process of the lead character. Sensory stimuli that the character encounters or random thoughts that might pop into his head are all incorporated into the narration to create a story that gives the reader a better impression of the character's state of mind than other styles. Books that fall into this category are often very liberal in terms of syntax and grammar to reflect the characters rambling thought patterns .\n\"Koolaids\" fits many of these criteria but takes the notion of a stream of consciousness to a new level. Well known stream of consciousness works usually follow very few characters, such as Virginia Woolf's \"Mrs. Dalloway\", which follows two character, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Warren Smith, through an average day in their lives. Other novels, such as Faulkner's \"The Sound and the Fury\", follow a team of characters that are closely linked, in this case all associated with a single southern plantation. \"Koolaids\" follows more than just a team of characters. As stated above, there are the identifiable main characters, Mohammed and Samir. These characters do know each other and interact, but there are many others that are followed that only have in common the fact that their lives were impacted by either AIDS or the Lebanese Civil War. Whereas a novel like \"Mrs. Dalloway\" follows more than one character in order to contrast the minds of sane person with a person on the brink of mental illness, \"Koolaids\" does not have such an understandable reason for having multiple and often unidentified narrators. This conforms to the book's theme of chaos, the loss of identity experienced in modern Lebanese society and the San Francisco gay community following the civil war and the AIDS epidemic.\nAnother way Koolaids differs from established stream of conscious literature is through its lack of structurally sequenced time. Established stream of consciousness works, such as \"The Sound and the Fury\", may be literarily complicated, but they generally have some identifiable chronology. \"Koolaids\" goes back and forth over the course of more than twenty years, from the childhoods of various characters, through to the death of Mohammed occurring in the present. This can be confusing at times, but like the other vignettes, it can be understood at the end and a unified story becomes apparent.\nA place where \"Koolaids\" does seem to conform to the style of stream of consciousness is in its lack of a conclusion. The novel ends with Mohammed dying unceremoniously, much as \"The Sound and the Fury\" ends abruptly with the Compsons driving around town in a decaying carriage.\nPostmodern Literature.\nThe link between the style of \"Koolaids\" and stream of consciousness literature makes more sense when the novel's status as a postmodernist work is taken into account. Postmodern literature, as suggested by its name, was a reaction to the norms of modernist literature, but drew much influence from the stream of conscious style. These books tend to explore multiple levels of an inner state of consciousness, reject a distinction between high and low culture, and an acknowledgement that more and more of society is becoming commoditized and fetishized. They also reject the modernist notion that all existence has an underlying meaning or cause (see existentialism), such as the notion that the decay of the Compsons in \"The Sound and the Fury\" was related to the fall of the American South. Many works also employ a sense of intertextuality and self-referentiality not found in the literature of previous generations .\n\"Koolaids\" falls into many of the postmodern criteria. The following of multiple, seemingly unrelated characters\u2019 streams of consciousness relates to trying to display multiple levels of inner consciousness. The novel contains various extremely graphic sexual scenes that sit alongside beautifully narrated accounts of the characters lives. By implying that sexual and violent scenes can be incorporated into a respectable novel, Alameddine is effectively erasing any notion that high and low art should be kept separate and stating that all is connected. Another way that \"Koolaids\" conforms to the postmodern ideal is in its lack of a deeper current unifying all the tragedy it contains. The only thing unifying the events in the book is the notion of chaos, the very opposite of meaning and order. A final way that Alameddine's novel conforms to postmodern literature is through the self-referentiality of some of the narrators. An example of this is on page 114, where the narrator says, \"Hey you!\" in a direct call to the reader. Another, more subtle, self-reference begins on page 221 and continues through page 231. In this, the narrator describes a play he wanted to write that described the workings of Lebanese society in a very concise way. The \"play\" that follows seems to make references to actual characters spoken about in other parts of the novel, a nod to the great intertextuality found within postmodernist works. The book may effectively be considered a postmodern stream of conscious novel. Stylistically it draws heavily from that modernist technique, but at the same time it rejects the ideals of modernism in favor of the postmodernist standard. \"Koolaids\" remains very hard to classify due to its intricate plots and vignettes masterfully crafted by Alameddine. Its existentialist message can at times be very hard to decipher.\nCultural and Political References.\nHIV/AIDS in Koolaids.\nOne of the major cultural references in the novel Koolaids is the disease HIV/AIDS. Almost every character in the story is related to the disease in some way. Alameddine's characters constantly refer to HIV/AIDS related terms and the disease itself throughout the novel. Sometimes it is slight and other times it is quite obvious. The characters seem to have a non-chalant way of approaching the disease. At times it even seems like they do not care to inform the reader of the terms they use.\nThe first reference to HIV/AIDS is a \u201cKS lesion\u201d which is found on page 8. A \u201cKS legion\u201d is a Kaposi's sarcoma lesion, which form on various places of a person in a later stage of HIV/AIDS. The lesions are most visible and recognizable on skin, and therefore give away the HIV/AIDS status of the person who has them. Those who read the book and have no former experience with HIV/AIDS may not understand the terms. In this way of writing, Alammedine has a select audience that he writes to. Other HIV/AIDS vocabulary used throughout the novel are CMV retinitis (Cytomegalovirus retinitis), in which the infected person loses his or her eyesight. One of the narrators refers to this condition when talking of his friend who was an artist who stopped painting due to CMV retinitis. In this reference he sort of describes the condition by saying that his friend, \u201ccouldn\u2019t see worth shit due to CMV retinitis\u201d (10). One of the most impactful references to HIV/AIDS in the novel is short, nine sentences long. It says:\n\u201cSo Billy Shakespeare was queer. Ronnie was the greatest president in history, right up there on Mount Rushmore. AIDS is mankind\u2019s greatest plague. Israel only kills terrorists. American never bombed Lebanon. Jesus was straight. Judas and he were just friends. Roseanne\u2019s parents molested her as an infant. Menachem Begin and Yasser Arafat deserved their Nobles. And Gaetan Dugas stated the AIDS epidemic\u201d(12).\nThis short paragraph gives a good take on the controversies of society's view of history, especially of HIV/AIDS . The lines are meant to encourage the reader to challenge these assumptions or accept them. For example, Shakespeare's sexuality is a debate that has been raging for years. Ronnie is Ronald Reagan and the statement of him being the best president is very contentious. In Koolaids, Reagan is regularly referenced, and not in a positive light. The Gaetan Dugas sentence reflects on how many people and some falsely still think that Dugas started the entire epidemic. With these obviously inflammatory remarks, Alameddine grabs the reader's attention and starts the novel off with an interesting section, which sets the mood for much of the book.\nHIV/AIDS seems to just pop up throughout the novel and its notation is just as sporadic as other subjects in Koolaids. Treatments and symptoms are mentioned without serious thought and have a dark tone. The narrators talk about HIV/AIDS as if it is this modern day Apocalypse, that everyone will soon have. When oxygen saturation is referenced the narrator says, \u201cOx sat. I bet you don\u2019t know what ox sat is. Oxygen saturation\u201d (47). Yet, again it is mentioned in a way that excludes some readers. Perhaps the narrators do not want to include the readers, and all of the terms are meant for us to not even look up, but just accept.\nOne of the themes in the novel seems to be self-awareness of HIV/AIDS. For example, after an incident involving Christopher, who is HIV positive, sharing his food with his sister sparks outrage. His brother-in-law, Dennis, becomes very upset and accuses Christopher of possibly infecting his sister with HIV/AIDS. In response to Dennis' anger Christopher's partner, Joe, makes his position to Dennis, and possibly to the reader, very clear, \u201cNeither Christopher, nor I are here to be your HIV or AIDS education service\u201d (109). Perhaps Alameddine wants the readers to realize that the responsibility of being informed about HIV/AIDS is your own. Although Alameddine does not provide anything on the prevention of HIV/AIDS, the inclusion of HIV/AIDS vocabulary allows the reader to be exposed to the reality of the disease. Alameddine's approach is to intrigue readers to learn more about HIV/AIDS by not explaining everything to them. By planting curiosity within the readers minds, they will seek the knowledge.\nAnother concept about HIV/AIDS throughout the novel is the ignorance of HIV/AIDS by American society. When the epidemic started out as Gay-related immune deficiency (GRID) in the late 70s, early 80s, the disease only infected homosexual men. As we read further into the book, criticisms and notes on HIV/AIDS in popular culture become more prevalent. There is a certain section of the book, almost right in the middle where there is a mock Walton scene. At first the narrator says \u201cI love you to all\u201d of these characters, who presumably already died. Then he goes on to talk about a movie called Longtime Companion, that he believes was a joke, and \u201ccould have been called The Waltons Do AIDS\u201d (114). The movie is said to have been unrealistic and it appears that all the characters sort of died off one by one. Another movie referenced in this montage is Philadelphia (film), which has a bad reception as well. At the end of this scene the narrator says, \u201cAsk the reader. They have an objective view of this whole thing. Okay. Hey you! Hey you! Do you think this is enough?\u201d (114). The anger within the voice of the character radiates off the page. Perhaps it is to ask the reader if the pop culture reaction to HIV/AIDS has been significant, or if it has been ignored. Due to the constant cultural references in the book when HIV/AIDS is presented it is obvious that HIV/AIDS was and has been ignored by the \u201cmajority\u201d for a while.\nThis concept is visited again and the message is more obvious when the narrator states, \u201cWhen did the last AIDS story make a newspaper\u2019s front page? My friends die. They keep dying, but people forget. Life goes on\u201d (152). The statement most likely is a reflection of the portrayal of the disease. It is often ignored in the media and because of this ignorance, more people believe lies about HIV/AIDS and are not familiar with any terms or medication that those with HIV/AIDS use.\nAlameddine appears to have written Koolaids as a reference for readers to learn more about many taboo topics, especially HIV/AIDS. This novel is a good resource for a unique perspective on HIV/AIDS, and also creates intrigue for the reader to learn more about the topics in the novel.\nThe Lebanese Civil War.\nOne of the main components of Alameddine's novel and one of the few linear components are the diary entries of Samir's mother, written during the Lebanese Civil War. She gives detailed accounts of her life as a result of the war and how it affects those around her. The first diary entry we are given, dated March 20, 1976, gives an account barely a year after the war began (April 1975). We receive a first hand account of how innocent people are injured and killed as a result of the war, but we are never really given any background information on the war.\nThe Lebanese Civil War extended over a 15-year period of time from April 1975-October 1990. The causes of the war are based on the planned arrangement of political power amongst various ethnic and religious groups, stemming from when the country gained its independence from France in 1943. At the time, Maronite Christians were sited as the largest single group. However, the country also included Sunni Muslims, Shia Muslims, and Greek Orthodox Christians. In 1943, once independence was achieved, the National Pact was formed between the Maronites and Shia Muslims, ensuring that those groups will always be in the most powerful political positions. The problem was that this type of government, known as a confessional democracy, left political power in the hands of the same elite families that had power under the French rule. By the early 60s, the majority of people in Lebanon were Muslim, yet the country was still ruled by the Maronite Christians.\nDuring the late 1950s, pan-Arabism became widespread but Lebanon's Maronite president, Camille Chamoun, held pro-Western views, which led to his isolation in the Middle East. In May 1958, a civil war erupted. This, in combination with other events occurring simultaneously in the Middle East, led the United States to send troops to the Middle East. This three-week war killed up to 4,000 Lebanese.\nBut the most important part of this conflict in terms of \"Koolaids\" stems from the attack of the militia of the Christian Phalange faction on Palestinians in East Beirut on April 13, 1975. Innocent deaths were ubiquitous - as Samir's mother states in her first diary entry, Najwa's husband and three sons die just sitting in their apartment. During these first few years, the Lebanese National Movement (LNM) fought for the abolition of the National Pact and their partner, the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) was expelled from Lebanon. However, this war quickly grew to involve more surrounding countries, as leaders in other countries realized the effects this civil war would have on the rest of the Middle East. Both Syria and Israel supported one of the Christian factions, but Syria quickly changed its allegiance to the National Liberal Party - a Muslim, pro-Palestinian group. The PLO attacked Israel and in June 1982, Israel bombed Lebanon.\nWar continued until the Fall of 1989 when remaining members of the Lebanese parliament met in Saudi Arabia to draft the National Reconciliation Charter, commonly known as the Taif Agreement. Power was now equally split amongst Christians and Muslims. However another rebellion was launched in 1990 but was suppressed by Syria, thus ending the 15-year civil war.\nOverall, nearly 200,000 Lebanese died during these years. And although the Lebanese government was now reformed, it is still based on religious and ethnic quotas.\nGa\u00ebton Dugas.\nGa\u00ebtan Dugas, during the time in which \"Koolaids\" takes place, was considered to be patient zero of AIDS. He was a flight attendant who was falsely thought to have carried the disease from Africa to the Western World. Even though he claimed to have more than 2,500 sexual partners, there is little support that he was the sole person involved in the spread of AIDS epidemic. He is mentioned near the beginning of this novel where lists of famous and historical figures who were arguably homosexual are written.\nRonald Reagan.\nRonald Reagan, although not immediately, promoted U.S. involvement in the Lebanese Civil War. Although he planned to keep troops in Lebanon after the Beirut barracks bombing, that plan was later aborted. He kept troops in Lebanon for less than a year. \nIn addition to criticism for his lack of involvement in the crises in Lebanon in \"Koolaids,\" his administration is also criticized for its extraordinarily slow response to the HIV-AIDS epidemic that occurred during his presidency. In April 1984, the Center for Disease Control announced nearly 2,000 deaths in America, yet Reagan still said nothing. By the time he finally addressed the issue in 1987, 20,849 Americans had died from AIDS. \nMany people still question how much the death toll and research regarding treatments would have changed had he acknowledged the disease when it first arose in America. \nTitle.\nThe title \"Koolaids: The Art of War\" is a combination of the fruit drink Kool-Aid and Sun Tzu's book \"The Art of War\".\nAlameddine directly mentions Kool-Aid within the text of the novel twice. It makes its first appearance as one of the narrative blurbs on page 99. He writes:\nDeath, when it approaches, ought not to take one by surprise. It should be part of the full expectancy of life. Without an ever-present sense of death, life is insipid. You might as well live on the whites of eggs. You might as well drink Kool-Aid.\nThis phrase, \"drinking the Kool-Aid\" has a particular significance, meaning to accept an argument or philosophy completely or blindly. The term originated from the Jonestown Massacre, in which 913 People's Temple cultists committed mass suicide by drinking potassium cyanide laced Flavor Aid, a product similar to Kool-Aid.\nThe second use of Kool-Aid is on page 191, following a vignette about Marwa. In this story, while living in France as teenagers, Mohammad's sister asks a teen magazine for a pen pal from the U.S. She receives a letter from Sarah Miller, a girl who tells her all about her life in Des Moines, Iowa, which Marwa finds funny. Later, a highly exaggerated and fictional essay about growing up in war-torn Beirut written by Marwa and Nawal gets published in several newspapers, and the girls send it to Sarah as a reply. Sarah's next letter expresses her shock and includes a slice of fruitcake to \"ease the pain.\" Marwa and Nawal never reply, but Sarah continues to send them letters, containing more empathy, more daily happenings, and more gifts to \"ease the pain,\" which include a No. 2 pencil, a Mickey Mouse eraser, and a cookie. These letters continue to come, at least once every six months, always with a gift till the present day of the novel, when Mohammad overhears Nawal talking to Marwa about Sarah on the phone. Having never heard of Sarah before, he picks up the letter to find out about Sarah's newest deliberations and doings, along with her gift to ease their pain, which turns out to be a single packet of blue lemonade Kool-Aid.\nGiven that many of the characters in the novel are HIV+ and are dying from AIDS, the name \"Koolaids\", linking \"cool\" and \"AIDS\" together, may also be an attempt at black humor.\nSun Tzu and \"The Art of War\" are also mentioned in \"Koolaids\", at the end of one of the narrator's editorials on military conflicts in the Middle East. The narrator describes Israel and Hizballah firing at each other, and how each of them seem to be unable to hit anything but civilian targets. He concludes on page 97, saying:\nSo there you have it, a brief history of the Middle East version of \"The Art of War\". Who needs poor old Sun?\nCover Art.\nThere are three versions of \"Koolaids\" covers available. Two feature self-portraits of Rabih Alameddine, which come from a series of 270 different paintings \"based on the same image\". This image is a closeup of a man's face, focusing on the eyes, eyebrows, nose, and mouth. The Koolaids cover only uses one version of the self-portrait, but varies in the font of the title and the shade of the painting. For this particular self-portrait, the man's features are slightly fuzzily drawn, with very thick black lines. The rest of the painting, the skin of the face, is a mottled and faded yellow-green. There are a series of miniature sketches of the main face scaled down underneath the right eye, and several sketches of men running diagonally from above the nose to the left cheek. These sketches are mostly simple headshots with minimal detail. One however, contains more than just a head and shoulders. He is drawn down to the waist, and has more hair than the others.\nThe other cover is a quote from Amy Tan reviewing the book:\n \"Rabih Alameddine's \"\"Koolaids\" is the companion guide to \"The Tibetan Book of the Dead, The Diary of Anne Frank,\" and the history of the world. It is hysterical in both senses, hilarious and loudly disturbing. (Where else does Krishnamurti meet Eleanor Roosevelt and Tom Cruise?) Like Zen koans, \"Koolaids\" issues pronouncements while pointing out the absurdities of any kind of truth. It contemplates the meaning of death while redefining the meaninglessness of life. It looks at the great cycle of history, destiny, and literature and puts them on spin and recycle. This is an absolutely brilliant book - daring in its somersault of literary feats and allusions, an antidote for nayone who suffers from the blahs or an excess of self-satisfaction. I hope it's widely read.\"\n-Amy Tan\nThis quote is printed in black text, with Rabih Alameddine's name and the second usage of Koolaids printed in red. There is nothing else on the cover, just a white background.\nReception.\n\"Koolaids: The Art of War\" generally received positive critical reviews; \"Kirkus Reviews\" called it: A wildly uneven, but powerful and original portrayal of cultural and sexual displacement, alienation, and--in its admirably gritty way--pride.\n\"The Portland Oregonian\", \"Publishers Weekly\", and writer Amy Tan all wrote favorably of it as well. \n\"The New York Times\", however, found it mediocre, saying:\n[M]ost readers will wind up wishing Alameddine himself had more literary flair. Despite some interesting ideas and memorable imagery, his book demonstrates little feel for narrative. In fact, there is hardly any dramatic urgency in this collage of observations, thoughts and vignettes... ...An accomplished novelist can keep his readers' interest in a topsy-turvy story. But Alameddine has a long way to go before he can pull off that trick."}
{"title": "Fertilisation_of_Orchids", "label": "Book", "text": "Fertilisation of Orchids is a book by English naturalist Charles Darwin published on 15 May 1862 under the full explanatory title On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects, and On the Good Effects of Intercrossing. Darwin's previous book, \"On the Origin of Species\", had briefly mentioned evolutionary interactions between insects and the plants they fertilised, and this new idea was explored in detail. Field studies and practical scientific investigations that were initially a recreation for Darwin\u2014a relief from the drudgery of writing\u2014developed into enjoyable and challenging experiments. Aided in his work by his family, friends, and a wide circle of correspondents across Britain and worldwide, Darwin tapped into the contemporary vogue for growing exotic orchids.\nThe book was his first detailed demonstration of the power of natural selection, and explained how complex ecological relationships resulted in the coevolution of orchids and insects. The view has been expressed that the book led directly or indirectly to all modern work on coevolution and the evolution of extreme specialisation. It influenced botanists, and revived interest in the neglected idea that insects played a part in pollinating flowers. It opened up the new study areas of pollination research and reproductive ecology, directly related to Darwin's ideas on evolution, and supported his view that natural selection led to a variety of forms through the important benefits achieved by cross-fertilisation. Although the general public showed less interest and sales of the book were low, it established Darwin as a leading botanist. \"Orchids\" was the first in a series of books on his innovative investigations into plants.\nThe book describes how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view that beautiful organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of \"Catasetum\", which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of \"Angraecum sesquipedale\" meant that there must be a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when \"Xanthopan morganii praedicta\" was found in Madagascar.\nBackground.\nCharles Darwin grew up with an interest in natural history, and as a student at the University of Cambridge he became a pupil and close friend of botany professor John Stevens Henslow. The year he graduated, Darwin was given a supernumerary position as a gentleman naturalist and geologist on the second voyage of HMS \"Beagle\", a trip that lasted five years. By the time he returned in October 1836, he had doubts about the doctrine that species were fixed and unchanging. Within months, experts informed him that specimens he had collected were separate species, not just varieties, and the patterns he saw inspired the inception of his theory of natural selection in 1838. Darwin began editing and publishing the expert reports, collected in the \"Zoology of the Voyage of H.M.S. Beagle\", at the same time as writing a series of books on geology, the first of which was \"The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs\". His \"species work\" was his \"prime hobby\", a background to this writing, but it evolved into an extensive research programme during the twenty years before he published his theory.\nInsect fertilisation of plants.\nDarwin's speculations on the origin of species convinced him that cross-fertilisation played an important role in keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated the contribution of insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.\nIn the summer of 1841 Charles and Emma Darwin moved from the turmoil of London to the countryside, to Down House, a quiet former parsonage in the village of Downe. He wrote, \"The flowers are here very beautiful\". Darwin followed the recommendation of his friend, the leading botanist Robert Brown, and read \"Das entdeckte Geheimnis der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen\" (\"The Secret of Nature in the Form and Fertilisation of Flowers Discovered\"). The little known book, published in 1793 by Christian Konrad Sprengel but never translated into English, introduced the idea that flowers were created by God to fulfill a teleological purpose: insects would act as \"living brushes\" to cross-fertilise plants in a symbiotic relationship. This functional view was rejected and mostly forgotten, as it contradicted the common belief that flowers had been created for beauty, and were generally self-fertilising. For Darwin, the concept of evolution gave new meaning to Sprengel's research into the mechanisms for cross-fertilisation. He welcomed its support for his supposition that cross-fertilisation in flowering plants tended to allow their offspring to avoid possible disadvantages resulting from self-fertilisation, and by 1845 he had verified many of Sprengel's observations.\nA favourite walk took the Darwin family to a spot above the quiet Cudham valley, teeming with orchids including \"Cephalanthera\", \"Neottia\", fly orchids and musk orchids. They called this place \"Orchis Bank\", and the whole family became involved in Darwin's researches. Darwin observed orchids every summer, but in twenty years, only on two occasions (when he noticed butterflies \"sucking \"O. pyramidalis\" and \"Gymnadenia\"\") did he see insects visiting flowers.\nIn 1854, Darwin began to work full-time on the origin of species. He examined orchids and counted how often one or both pollinia (pollen masses) had been removed from their flowers, indicating that they had been visited by insects. He experimented with insect pollination to investigate whether, by cross-fertilising field crops such as Fabaceae, they would yield more vigorous offspring, and published letters about his inconclusive results in \"The Gardeners' Chronicle\" in 1857 and 1858. He next applied Sprengel's methods to empirical research on orchids. Despite delays caused by recurring illness, he made progress on writing his planned \"Big Book\" on evolution, but when Alfred Russel Wallace's letter prompted joint publication of both of their theories of natural selection in 1858, Darwin quickly wrote \"On the Origin of Species\" as an abstract of his theory, published on 22 November 1859. In this book, he gave credence to Sprengel's ideas on the advantages of \"intercrossing\", and noted: \"Many of our orchidaceous plants absolutely require the visits of moths to remove their pollen masses and thus to fertilise them\". He introduced his new concept, the process of coevolution, describing the co-adaptation of bumblebees and red clover, and speculating \"how a flower and a bee might slowly become, either simultaneously or one after the other, modified and adapted in the most perfect manner to each other, by the continued preservation of individuals presenting mutual and slightly favourable deviations of structure\". This was a theme he developed in his orchid book.\nBotany as recreation.\nAfter \"On the Origin of Species\" was published, Darwin became involved in producing revised editions as well as working on \"Variation of Animals and Plants Under Domestication\" as the first part of his planned \"Big Book\". By the spring of 1860 he had tired of the grind of writing, and needed something fresh and interesting to study. During a family visit to relatives at Hartfield, he was searching for orchids when he noticed a sundew. He collected it and tried to feed it insects, thus beginning a long-term study of insectivorous plants. He investigated other botanical questions raised by his ideas of natural selection, including the advantages of sexual dimorphism in primulas, and the adaptive mechanisms that ensure cross-pollination in orchids. As an enthusiastic practical scientist, such investigations gave him a strong sense of personal enjoyment. He relished pitting his wits against nature, and following lucky hunches. His theory was a way of looking at the world, enabling him to find creative solutions to problems that traditional approaches could not solve. He later wrote, \"I am like a gambler, &amp; love a wild experiment.\"\nAround the end of April 1860, Darwin discussed insect pollination with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, and mentioned the bee orchid. Darwin corresponded with Hooker's assistant Daniel Oliver, the senior curator at Kew Gardens, who became a follower of Darwin's ideas. At the start of June, Darwin wrote to \"The Gardeners' Chronicle\" asking for readers' observations on how bee or fly orchids were fertilised. His letter described the mechanisms for insect fertilisation he had discovered in common British orchids, and reported his experimental observations that pollen masses were removed from \"Orchis morio\" and \"Orchis mascula\" plants in the open, but left in their pouches in adjacent plants under a glass bell jar. He wrote to American botanist Asa Gray that he had been \"so struck with admiration at the contrivances, that I have sent notice to Gardeners Chronicle\", and made similar enquiries of other experts.\nDarwin became engrossed in meticulous microscopic examination, tracing the complicated mechanisms of flowers that attracted insects by their nectar so that the insects transported pollen to cross-pollinate other plants, and on 19 July he told Hooker, \"I am intensely interested on subject, just as at a game of chess.\" In September, he \"dissected with the greatest interest\" and wrote, \"The contrivances for insect fertilisation in Orchids are multiform &amp; truly wonderful &amp; beautiful.\" By October, he had \"a large mass of notes with many new facts\", but set them aside \"convinced that I ought to work on \"Variation\" &amp; not amuse myself with interludes\".\nResearch and draft.\nDuring 1861, botany became a preoccupation for Darwin, and his projects became serious scientific pursuits. He continued his study of orchids throughout the summer, writing to anyone who might be able to supply specimens he had not yet examined. Field naturalists, botanists, and country gentry sent specimens from across the British Isles. Darwin also tramped around the countryside with tin cans and biscuit boxes, collecting specimens which his gardeners potted up for him. His family joined in, and neighbours contributed to the research. As he had only a cold greenhouse, a friend on the other side of the village who had a hot-house allowed him to use that, and offered the services of his gardener to look after the delicate specimens. Darwin's aim was to show how the complex structures and life cycles of the plants could be explained by natural selection rather than by the handiwork of God; he saw the huge variety of flowers as a collection of \"ad hoc\" evolutionary adaptations. In June he described his examination of bee orchids as a passion, and his findings on insect fertilisation of orchids as \"beautiful facts\".\nThere were several replies to Darwin's enquiry in \"The Gardeners' Chronicle\" seeking evidence to support his idea that pollen masses attached themselves to a convenient place on an insect's back or head, usually its proboscis, to transport the pollen to another flower. One envelope appeared to be empty when it arrived at Down House, but when he looked further before discarding it he found several insect mouthparts with pollen masses attached. To help their daughter Henrietta convalesce from illness, the Darwins arranged to spend two months in Torquay. Darwin wrote:\nHe sought advice on obtaining the exotic South American \"Catasetum\", to see it eject pollen masses, as \"I am got intensely interested on subject &amp; think I understand pretty well all the British species.\" They went to Torquay on 1 July, and Darwin began writing his orchid paper. By 10 August, he feared his paper would run \"to 100 M.S. folio pages!!! The beauty of the adaptations of parts seems to me unparalleled\u00a0... I marvel often as I think over the diversity &amp; perfection of the contrivances.\"\nThe family returned to Downe on 27 August, and Darwin again wrote to the \"Gardeners' Chronicle\" appealing for assistance as he was \"very anxious to examine a few exotic forms\". His requests to the wealthy enthusiasts who had taken up the fashionable pursuit of growing rare orchids brought large numbers of specimens. These would be a test of his theory: previously aspects such as coloration of plants and animals had often been regarded as having no adaptive function. For example, Thomas Henry Huxley was strongly influenced by German idealism and in 1856 had asked if it was \"to be supposed for a moment that the beauty of colour and outline\u00a0... are any \"good\" to the animals?\u00a0... Who has ever dreamed of finding an utilitarian purpose in the forms and colours of flowers\u00a0... ?\" Darwin had, and in the orchids he tackled the most difficult case. His ideas would transform the way naturalists thought about coloration.\nThe completed \"Orchis\" paper came to 140 folio pages, and Darwin decided against presenting it at the Linnean Society of London, thinking of publishing a pamphlet instead. He offered the draft to John Murray who agreed to publish it as a book. Although Darwin feared a lack of public interest, he hoped it would serve to \"illustrate how Natural History may be worked under the belief of the modification of Species\". In discussions with Asa Gray about natural theology, he wrote that \"it really seems to me incredibly monstrous to look at an orchid as created as we now see it. Every part reveals modification on modification.\"\nAs a popular and acceptable activity, botany had been taken up by many middle class ladies, and Darwin included these botany enthusiasts in his correspondence. On the recommendation of John Lindley, Darwin wrote to Lady Dorothy Nevill, who responded generously by sending numerous exotic orchids, and requested a signed photograph of him to hang in her sitting room next to portraits of her other notable friends, including Hooker.\nLinnean Society paper.\nThe orchid book was delayed because of illness, but Darwin continued to \"look at it as a hobby-horse, which has given me great pleasure to ride\". He was particularly astounded by the long spur of the \"Angraecum sesquipedale\" flowers, one of the orchids sent by the distinguished horticulturist James Bateman, and wrote to Hooker \"Good Heavens what insect can suck it[?]\"\nBy November, a specimen of the exotic South American \"Catasetum\" orchid Hooker had given to Darwin had shown its \"truly marvellous\" mechanism, by which it shot out a pollinium at any insect touching a part of the flower \"with sticky gland always foremost\". This plant had astonished botanists in 1836 when Robert Hermann Schomburgk stated that he had seen one plant growing three distinct flowers which usually grew separately and had wrongly been categorised as three distinct genera, namely \"Catasetum tridentatum\", \"Monachanthus viridis\", and \"Myanthus barbatus\". John Lindley had remarked that \"such cases shake to the foundation all our ideas of the stability of genera and species.\" One of Darwin's correspondents told of delight at growing a beautiful specimen of \"Myanthus barbatus\" imported from Demerara, then dismay when the plant flowered the next year as a simple \"Catasetum\".\nIn view of this interest, Darwin prepared a paper on \"Catasetum\" as an extract from his forthcoming book, which was read to the Linnean Society of London on 3 April 1862. Darwin solved the puzzle by showing that the three flowers were the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of a single species, but as they differed so much from each other, they had been classified as different genera.\nPublication.\nDarwin sent the incomplete manuscript to his publisher John Murray on 9 February 1862, while he was still working on the last chapter. Although anxious that the book might not sell, he could \"say with confidence that the M.S. contains many new &amp; very curious facts &amp; conclusions\". When the book was printed, he sent out presentation copies to all the individuals and societies who had helped him with his investigations, and to eminent botanists in Britain and abroad for review.\nOn 15 May 1862 the book was published under the full title of \"On the Various Contrivances by Which British and Foreign Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects, and On the Good Effects of Intercrossing\". In August, Darwin was \"well contented with the sale of 768 copies; I shd. hope &amp; expect that the remainder will ultimately be sold\", but the book sold slowly and less than 2,000\u00a0copies of the first edition were printed. An expanded edition translated into French was published in Paris in 1870, and in 1877 Murray brought out a revised and expanded second edition, with the shortened title \"The Various Contrivances by Which Orchids Are Fertilised by Insects\". This was also published by D. Appleton &amp; Company of New York in 1877, and a German translation was published in the same year. Despite being well praised by botanists, only about 6,000\u00a0copies of the English editions had been sold by 1900.\nContent.\nDarwin set out a detailed study of common descent with modifications by expanding on the theme of coevolution between local populations of insects and flowering plants that he had briefly discussed in \"On the Origin of Species\". He examined numerous ways in which orchids vary, showing how they had diverged and developed specialised pollen-dispersal mechanisms. The intricate morphology and anatomy of each flower was carefully described. Apparently trivial details were examined in relation to natural selection to demonstrate how slight variations in similar structures of closely related flowers led to specialised modifications that provided various pollinators (insects) with different ways to cross-fertilise. The mass of descriptive detail was a great achievement, but the result is demanding to read.\nIn the introduction, Darwin explained his aim of meeting complaints that detailed support for his theory was lacking in \"On the Origin of Species\". He chose orchids for his subject as \"amongst the most singular and most modified forms in the vegetable kingdom\" in the hope of inspiring work on other species, and felt that \"the study of organic beings may be as interesting to an observer who is fully convinced that the structure of each is due to secondary laws, as to one who views every trifling detail of structure as the result of the direct interposition of the Creator.\" He gave due credit to previous authors who had described the agency of insects in fertilising orchids, and all who had helped him.\nBritish orchids.\nIn the first chapter Darwin described the British orchids he had studied, giving detailed explanations of their various mechanisms for transferring pollen to insects. The first mechanism described is that of \"Orchis mascula\", which serves as an introduction to the explanation of other Orchidaceae. In the upper part of the flower a petal shelters the male organ which has two packages of pollen grains, held together by thin elastic threads. These pollen masses stand side by side and have stalks down to adhesive balls in a cup which keeps them moist and sticky. When an insect lands on the large projecting lower petal, the labellum, and pushes its head and proboscis into the centre of the flower and down to the nectary, it breaks the cup and the adhesive balls attach the pollen masses to the front of the insect. As the insect flies off, each stalk rotates the pollen mass downwards and forwards so that when the insect lands on another flower the pollen masses attached to the insect pass under the male organ and leave pollen on the female organ, achieving cross fertilisation. Darwin envisaged:\nThis is followed by descriptions of the differences in the mechanisms of several other orchids. In \"Orchis pyramidalis\", the adhesive balls are combined together into a strap or saddle shape, which curls round the thin proboscis of a moth or butterfly to attach to it the pair of pollen masses, illustrated in the book by showing a moth's head with seven pairs of pollen masses attached to its proboscis.\nWhile the bee orchid showed adaptation for self-fertilisation, its mechanism also enabled occasional cross-fertilisation, creating the biological diversity that Darwin felt was needed for vigorous survival, which could not be provided by self-fertilisation. As an example of \"how beautifully everything is contrived\", Darwin described how he had found that in \"Spiranthes\" flowers the pollen is ready for collection before access is open for the female organ to receive pollen. At Torquay he had watched bees visiting spires of these flowers, starting at the bottom of the spire and working their way up to the topmost flowers. He speculated that if bees moved from top to top of the spires, the pollen clusters they collected from the most recently opened flowers would be wasted as the topmost flowers on the next spike would not be ready to receive pollen. A bee starting at the lowest flowers on the first spire it visited would continue up until it reached flowers that still had their pollen masses to attach to the bee, then would fly to the mature lower flowers on another plant, and fertilise them. By this co-ordinated process, the bee would add \"to her store of honey\" while perpetuating the flowers \"which will yield honey to future generations of bees\".\nExotic orchids.\nThe book moves on to the various foreign orchids Darwin had received from others. His experiments showed that the \"astonishing length\" of the 11\u00a0inch (290\u00a0mm) long nectary hanging from \"Angraecum sesquipedale\" flowers implied the need for an as yet unknown moth with a proboscis 10\u201311\u00a0inches (250\u2013275\u00a0mm) long to pollinate these flowers in Madagascar. He viewed this as the outcome of a coevolutionary race, writing that \"there has been a race in gaining length between the nectary of the Angr\u00e6cum and the proboscis of certain moths\". This wastefulness is familiar in modern terms as the idea of an evolutionary arms race, but was disturbing to biologists of the time who believed that adaptations were the outcome of benevolent divine purpose.\nDarwin described \"the most remarkable of all Orchids\", \"Catasetum\", and showed how in these flowers, \"as throughout nature, pre-existing structures and capacities [had been] utilised for new purposes\". He explained the mechanism in which the pollen masses of the pollinium were connected by a bent stalk or pedicel to a sticky disc kept moist at the back of the flower. When an insect touched an \"antenna\" projecting from the back of the flower, this released the bent pedicel which sprang straight and fired the pollinium, sticky disc first, at the insect. In experiments, Darwin had imitated this action using a whalebone spring. He vividly illustrated how the flower ejected the pollinium with considerable force: \"I touched the antenn\u00e6 of C. callosum whilst holding the flower at about a yard's distance from the window, and the pollinium hit the pane of glass, and adhered to the smooth vertical surface by its adhesive disc.\"\nFinal chapter.\nDarwin noted that the essential nectar, secreted to attract insects, seemed also in some cases to act as an excretion: \"It is in perfect accordance with the scheme of nature, as worked out by natural selection, that matter excreted to free the system from superfluous or injuring substances should be utilised for purposes of the highest importance.\" Homologies of the flowers of orchids showed them all to be based on \"fifteen groups of vessels, arranged three within three, in alternating order\". He disparaged the idea that this was an \"ideal type\" fixed by the Omnipotent Creator, but attributed it instead to its \"descent from some monocotyledonous plant, which, like so many other plants of the same division, possessed fifteen organs, arranged alternately three within three in five whorls; and that the now wonderfully changed structure of the flower is due to a long course of slow modification,\u2014each modification having been preserved which was useful to each plant, during the incessant changes to which the organic and the inorganic world has been exposed\".\nDescribing the final end state of the whole flower cycle as the production of seed, he set out a simple experiment in which he took a ripe seed capsule and arranged the seeds in a line, then counted the seeds in one-tenth of an inch (2.5\u00a0mm). By multiplication he found that each plant produced enough seeds to plant of ground, and the great grandchildren of a single plant could \"carpet the entire surface of the land throughout the globe\" if unchecked.\nIn conclusion, he felt that the book had \"shown that Orchids exhibit an almost endless diversity of beautiful adaptations. When this or that part has been spoken of as contrived for some special purpose, it must not be supposed that it was originally always formed for this sole purpose. The regular course of events seems to be, that a part which originally served for one purpose, by slow changes becomes adapted for widely different purposes.\"\nHe was almost exasperated by the inventiveness of forms in nature; \"In my examination of Orchids, hardly any fact has so much struck me as the endless diversity of structure,\u2014the prodigality of resources,\u2014for gaining the very same end, namely, the fertilisation of one flower by the pollen of another.\" His focus on detail was justified, as \"The use of each trifling detail of structure is far from a barren search to those who believe in natural selection.\" The \"contrivances and beautiful adaptations\" slowly acquired through slight variations, subjected to natural selection \"under the complex and ever-varying conditions of life\", far transcended the most fertile imagination. The mechanisms to transport the pollen of one flower or of one plant to another flower or plant underlined the importance of cross-fertilisation: \"For may we not further infer as probable, in accordance with the belief of the vast majority of the breeders of our domestic productions, that marriage between near relatives is likewise in some way injurious,\u2014that some unknown great good is derived from the union of individuals which have been kept distinct for many generations?\"\nReception.\nBotanists responded favourably to the book immediately on its publication. Hooker told Darwin that the book showed him to be \"out of sight the best Physiological observer &amp; experimenter that Botany ever saw\", and was glad to note that two leading traditional botanists had accepted the concept of evolution; \"Bentham &amp; Oliver are quite struck up in a heap with your book &amp; delighted beyond expression\". Daniel Oliver thought it \"very extraordinary\", and even Darwin's old beetle-hunting rival Charles Babington, by then professor of botany at the University of Cambridge and inclined to oppose natural selection, called it \"exceedingly interesting and valuable\u00a0... highly satisfactory in all respects. The results are most curious and the skill shown in discovering them equally so.\" George Bentham praised its value in opening \"a new field for observing the wonderful provisions of Nature\u00a0... a new and unexpected track to guide us in the explanation of phenomena which had before that appeared so irreconcilable with the ordinary prevision and method shown in the organised world.\"\nThe book's success in botanical circles was enhanced following Bentham's public endorsement. In his presidential address to the Linnean Society on 24 May 1862, Bentham praised the book as exemplifying the biological method, and said that it had nearly overcome his opposition to the \"Origin\". In his address in 1863 he stated that \"Mr Darwin has shown how changes \"may\" take place\", and described it as \"an unimpeachable example of a legitimate hypothesis\" in compliance with John Stuart Mill's scientific method. This endorsement favourably influenced Miles Joseph Berkeley, Charles Victor Naudin, Alphonse Pyramus de Candolle, Jean Louis Quatrefages, and Charles Daubeny.\nIn June 1862, Darwin welcomed favourable reviews in the press and wrote to Hooker; \"Well my orchis-book is a success (but I do not know whether it sells) after cursing my folly in writing it\". He told his publisher, \"The Botanists praise my Orchid-book to the skies\", and to Asa Gray he said, \"I am fairly astonished at the success of my book with botanists.\" Darwin's geologist friend Charles Lyell gave it enthusiastic praise: \"next to the \"Origin\", as the most valuable of all Darwin's works.\" However, the book attracted little attention from the general public, and in September Darwin told his cousin Fox, \"Hardly any one not a botanist, except yourself, as far as I know, has cared for it.\" The book baffled a general public more interested in controversy over gorillas and cavemen. There were some reviews in gardening magazines, but few natural philosophers or zoologists noticed the book, and hardly any learned appraisals appeared.\nTheological responses.\nAlthough the book contradicted the prevailing natural theology and its teleological approach to design in nature, the \"Saturday Review\" thought that it would avoid the angry polemics aroused by \"On the Origin of Species\". The \"Literary Churchman\" welcomed \"Mr. Darwin's expression of admiration at the contrivances in orchids\", only complaining that it was too indirect a way of saying \"O Lord, how manifold are Thy works!\" (Psalm 104:24) Darwin regarded these theological views as irritating misunderstandings, but wrote to Asa Gray describing his approach as a \"flank movement on the enemy\". By showing that the \"wonderful contrivances\" of the orchid have discoverable evolutionary histories, Darwin was countering claims by natural theologians that the organisms were examples of the perfect work of the Creator.\nThere was considerable controversy surrounding Darwin's prediction that a moth would be found in Madagascar with a long proboscis matching the nectary of \"Angraecum sesquipedale\". An anonymous article in the \"Edinburgh Review\" of October 1862 by George Campbell, 8th Duke of Argyll, argued that Darwin's wording implied purpose, and concluded that \"We know, too, that these purposes and ideas are not our own, but the ideas and purposes of Another.\" He considered Darwin's explanations the \"most unsatisfactory conjectures\", and raised obscure metaphysical objections while supporting a kind of creative evolutionism. Emma Darwin thought that although Argyll was \"quite opposed\" to Darwin's views, \"he praises the \"Orchids\" in such an enthusiastic way that he will do it a good turn\". Darwin was delighted to find that a well written article \"smashing\" Argyll's review was by one of Darwin's own nephews.\nArgyll went on in his 1867 book \"The Reign of Law\" to cleverly ridicule Darwin's ideas, particularly the prediction of a moth in Madagascar with a proboscis 10\u201311\u00a0inches (250\u2013275\u00a0mm) long. He believed that adaptations showed divine purpose, not a mindless evolutionary arms race. In his response \"Creation by Law\" later that year, Alfred Russel Wallace produced a detailed explanation of how the nectary could have evolved through natural selection, and stated that he had carefully measured moths in the British Museum, finding that the proboscis of \"Macrosila cluentius\" from South America was 9\u00a0inches (235\u00a0mm) long, and the proboscis of \"Macrosila morganii\" from tropical Africa (since renamed \"Xanthopan morganii\") was 7\u00a0inches (190\u00a0mm) long. An enquiry raised in 1873 was answered by Darwin's friend Hermann M\u00fcller, who stated that his brother Fritz M\u00fcller had caught a sphinx moth in Brazil with a proboscis nearly long. Darwin's anticipation was fully met in 1903, when a subspecies of \"Xanthopan morganii\" was found in Madagascar with a proboscis about 12\u00a0inches (300\u00a0mm) long, and was named \"Xanthopan morganii praedicta\" to celebrate this verification of a testable prediction made by Darwin on the basis of his theory of natural selection.\nInfluence.\nMichael Ghiselin has expressed the view that all studies of coevolution follow directly or indirectly from Darwin's orchid book, which was also the origin of all work on the evolution of extreme specialisation. Its publication led almost immediately to research by many other naturalists into specialisation and coevolution, in some cases analysing other taxa. In his autobiography, Darwin modestly recalled how this work had revived interest in Christian Konrad Sprengel's neglected ideas:\nAmong the many prominent biologists who began research on coevolution, Hermann M\u00fcller was particularly interested in the evolutionary sequence in which insects and flowers became adapted to each other. Like Darwin, he began with the premise that flowers were adapted to ensure cross-fertilisation, and added his own premise that most insects were not \"limited by hereditary instinct to particular flowers\". On this basis, he developed the view that specialisation develops from the need for flowers to attract pollinating insects (without making access too easy for non-pollinators), and from the evolution of pollinators to adapt to changes in the location of rewards such as nectar. He found that alpine flowers tended to be visited by bees at lower altitudes, and by butterflies at higher altitudes, beginning research on the idea that plants at different altitudes were specialised for different pollinators. By comparing related plant species that he thought had diverged in form from a common ancestor, and testing whether they were visited by butterflies or bees, he was the first to use a combination of morphological and ecological approaches to understand patterns in the evolution of interactions and specialisation. His brother Fritz M\u00fcller used similar methods when studying mimicry in Brazil. The early development of ideas on specialisation and coevolution became increasingly focused on the problem of mimicry; Henry Walter Bates had initially raised this issue in a paper read to the Linnean Society of London in December 1861 in Darwin's presence, and published in November 1862.\nOthers basing their studies of reproductive ecology on Darwin's evolutionary approach included Friedrich Hildebrand and Severin Axell in Europe, Asa Gray and Charles Robertson in North America. In Italy, Federigo Delpino adopted the theory of descent but like Sprengel had a teleological approach and explained the mechanisms of flowers by the intervention of a \"psychovitalistic intelligence\". Delpino classified flowers on the basis of the pollinators they attracted, and coined many of the terms still in use such as pollination syndrome and ornithophily. There was an enormous increase in knowledge during this period. In 1874, Asa Gray paid tribute to Darwin's work on orchids for explaining \"all these and other extraordinary structures, as well as of the arrangement of blossoms in general, and even the very meaning and need of sexual propagation\". He credited Darwin with establishing the understanding that \"Nature abhors close fertilization\".\nBy the end of the 19th century, there were so many uncritical and unproven speculations about floral mechanisms that floral ecology became discredited. In the 1920s, it was revived with further developments in detailed analyses of insects' senses, led by researchers Frederic Clements, Karl von Frisch and others. Their experiments resulted in new information, including the discovery that some insects have ultraviolet vision, and findings involving bee learning and communication. Modern floral ecology has been reinvigorated by its relevance for evolutionary studies.\nFurther research by Darwin.\nDarwin had \"found the study of orchids eminently useful in showing me how nearly all parts of the flower are coadapted for fertilisation by insects, &amp; therefore the result of n. selection,\u2014even most trifling details of structure\". His own interest in orchids and in fertilisation of plants by insects continued. Darwin had been given the use of a hot-house at The Rookery on the other side of the village, and at the end of 1862 he was persuaded by this neighbour's helpful gardener to have his own built at Down House as an extension to the existing cold lean-to greenhouse. The gardener drew up plans, and Darwin investigated stoves and ventilation devices. When it was completed in February 1863 he asked Hooker for some plants from Kew Gardens, writing \"I long to stock it, just like a school-boy\", and sent his butler with a cart. When over 160 different plants were delivered, Darwin made apologetic remarks about depleting the national collection. He told Hooker \"You cannot imagine what pleasure your plants give me\u00a0... Henrietta &amp; I go &amp; gloat over them.\" Darwin's life was changed by having a warm hothouse to spend time in before his walk round the Sandwalk, and in the 1870s he had several more hothouses built. The children later remembered this routine and the gardeners attending to Darwin's experimental plants, as well as the way that Darwin used simple equipment for his experiments, dissecting and measuring plants and seeds.\nA chance observation \"thoroughly aroused\" Darwin's attention to a surprising decrease in vigour of the offspring of \"Linaria vulgaris\" following only one instance of self-fertilisation, and after eleven years of experimental work he published \"The Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom\" in 1876 as \"a complement to the 'Fertilisation of Orchids,' because it shows how important are the results of cross-fertilisation which are ensured by the mechanisms described in that book.\" He told a friend \"I cannot endure doing nothing\", and resumed his work on orchids, assisted in his research by his son Francis Darwin. He corresponded about orchids with Fritz M\u00fcller, and almost completely rewrote the book with a considerable amount of new material, much of which was contributed by M\u00fcller. The revised edition was published in 1877.\nFrancis Darwin described it as characteristic that his father delighted in the observations that preceded the publication of \"Fertilisation of Orchids\", not the applause which followed it. He quoted one of his father's last letters about orchids, written in 1880:\nCommemoration of Darwin's work on orchids.\nKent Wildlife Trust manages Downe Bank, which is near Down House and was a favourite place of the Darwin family, who called it 'Orchis Bank' because of the many wild orchids which grew there. It is now part of the 'Downe Bank and High Elms' Site of Special Scientific Interest.

{"title": "Northanger_Abbey", "label": "Book", "text": "Northanger Abbey () is a coming-of-age novel and a satire of Gothic novels written by Jane Austen. Austen was also influenced by Charlotte Lennox's \"The Female Quixote\" (1752). \"Northanger Abbey\" was completed in 1803, the first of Austen's novels completed in full, but was published posthumously in 1817 with \"Persuasion\". The story concerns Catherine Morland, the na\u00efve young protagonist, and her journey to a better understanding of herself and of the world around her. How Catherine views the world has been distorted by her fondness for Gothic novels and an active imagination. \nPlot summary.\nSeventeen-year-old Catherine Morland is one of ten children of a country clergyman. Although a tomboy in her childhood, by the age of 17 she is \"in training for a heroine\" and is excessively fond of reading Gothic novels, among which Ann Radcliffe's \"Mysteries of Udolpho\" is a favourite.\nCatherine is invited by the Allens (her wealthier neighbours in Fullerton) to accompany them to visit the city of Bath and partake in the winter season of balls, theatre and other social delights. Soon she is introduced to a clever young gentleman, Henry Tilney, with whom she dances and converses. Through Mrs. Allen's old schoolfriend Mrs. Thorpe, she meets her daughter Isabella, a vivacious and flirtatious young woman, and the two quickly become friends. Mrs. Thorpe's son, John, is also a friend of Catherine's older brother, James, at Oxford where they are both students.\nThe Thorpes are not happy about Catherine's friendship with the Tilneys, as they correctly perceive Henry as a rival for Catherine's affections, though Catherine is not at all interested in the crude John Thorpe. Catherine tries to maintain her friendships with both the Thorpes and the Tilneys, though John Thorpe continuously tries to sabotage her relationship with the Tilneys. This leads to several misunderstandings, which put Catherine in the awkward position of having to explain herself to the Tilneys.\nIsabella and James become engaged. James' father approves of the match and offers his son a country parson's living of a modest sum, \u00a3400 annually, but they must wait until he can obtain the benefice in two and a half years. Isabella is dissatisfied, but to Catherine, she misrepresents her distress as being caused solely by the delay, and not by the value of the sum. Isabella immediately begins to flirt with Captain Tilney, Henry's older brother. Innocent Catherine cannot understand her friend's behaviour, but Henry understands all too well, as he knows his brother's character and habits.\nThe Tilneys invite Catherine to stay with them for a few weeks at their home, Northanger Abbey. Catherine, in accordance with her novel reading, expects the abbey to be exotic and frightening. Henry teases her about this, as it turns out that Northanger Abbey is pleasant and decidedly not Gothic. However, the house includes a mysterious suite of rooms that no one ever enters; Catherine learns that they were the apartments of Mrs. Tilney, who died nine years earlier. As General Tilney no longer appears to be ill-affected by her death, Catherine decides that he may have murdered her or even imprisoned her in her chamber.\nCatherine discovers that her over-active imagination has led her astray, as nothing is strange or distressing in the apartments. Unfortunately, Henry questions her; he surmises, and informs her that his father loved his wife in his own way and was truly upset by her death. She leaves, crying, fearing that she has lost Henry's regard entirely. Realising how foolish she has been, Catherine comes to believe that, though novels may be delightful, their content does not relate to everyday life. Henry does not mention this incident to her again.\nJames writes to inform her that he has broken off his engagement to Isabella and that she has become engaged instead to Captain Tilney. Henry and Eleanor Tilney are sceptical that their brother has actually become engaged to Isabella Thorpe. Catherine is terribly disappointed, realising what a dishonest person Isabella is. A subsequent letter from Isabella herself confirms the Tilney siblings' doubts, and shows that Frederick Tilney was merely flirting with Isabella. The General goes off to London, and the atmosphere at Northanger Abbey immediately becomes lighter and pleasanter for his absence. Catherine passes several enjoyable days with Henry and Eleanor until, in Henry's absence, the General returns abruptly, in a temper. He forces Catherine to go home early the next morning, in a shocking, inhospitable, and unsafe move that forces Catherine to undertake the journey alone.\nAt home, Catherine is listless and unhappy. Henry pays a sudden unexpected visit and explains what happened. General Tilney (on the misinformation of John Thorpe) had believed her to be exceedingly rich as the Allens' prospective heiress, and therefore a proper match for Henry. In London, General Tilney ran into Thorpe again, who, angry and petty at Catherine's refusal of his half-made proposal of marriage, said instead that she was nearly destitute. Enraged, General Tilney, (again on the misinformation of John Thorpe), returned home to evict Catherine. When Henry returned to Northanger, his father informed him of what had occurred and forbade him to think of Catherine again. When Henry learns how she had been treated, he breaks with his father and tells Catherine he still wants to marry her despite his father's disapproval. Catherine is delighted, though when Henry seeks her parents' approval, they tell the young couple that final approval will only happen when General Tilney consents.\nEventually, General Tilney acquiesces, because Eleanor has become engaged to a wealthy and titled man; and he discovers that the Morlands, while not extremely rich, are far from destitute.\nCharacters.\nCatherine Morland: The naive 17-year-old protagonist of the novel, Catherine lacks life experience, but is determined to see the best in people. Her appearance is \"pleasing, and when in good looks, pretty.\" Her fondness for Gothic novels and an active imagination can skew her interpretation of real events. She has a sweet and good-natured personality and is observant but na\u00efve, not seeing malicious underlying intentions in people's actions until the end of the novel. She shares with Henry Tilney her love of sarcastic humour. The novel follows Catherine as she grows and matures into a better understanding of people's natures after being exposed to the outside world in Bath.\nJames Morland: Catherine's older brother studying at Oxford University makes a surprise visit to Bath to see his sister and parents. He is humble, sweet, and fun-loving like his sister but he is not a very good judge of character, and he is both na\u00efve and innocent when it comes to matters of the heart.\nHenry Tilney: A quirky 26-year-old well-read clergyman, brother of Eleanor and Frederick Tilney, and a member of the wealthy Tilney family. He is Catherine's love interest and comes to return her feelings in the course of the novel and marries her in the end. He is sarcastic, intuitive, fairly handsome, and clever in nature. He differs from Catherine in being attuned to the behaviour and underlying intentions of others and finds amusement in the folly of those around him.\nJohn Thorpe: Brother of Isabella Thorpe, John is an arrogant and boastful young man. A terrible conversationalist as he talks of nothing but of his horses and carriages; he is loud, dimwitted, overbearing, vengeful, and rude, even to his own mother. John initially takes interest in Catherine and grows increasingly possessive of her, but when he discovers that it is Henry Tilney whom she loves, he finds ways to manipulate the situation to suit his liking. \nIsabella Thorpe: Sister of John Thorpe, Isabella is a beautiful and charming 21-year-old woman who can be conniving and manipulative when it suits her purpose. She visits Bath in search of a wealthy husband. She befriends Catherine at Bath and when she learns about her family fortune, takes an interest in Catherine's brother, James Morland and eventually succeeds in getting a marriage offer which she accepts, but she later breaks off this engagement when she discovers that James will only receive a small portion of his inheritance and is forced to wait two years before marrying.\nGeneral Tilney: A stern and retired general, he is the despotic father of his three children: Captain Tilney (Frederick), Henry, and Eleanor. Rigid, overbearing, tyrannical, and materialistic in nature, General Tilney spends most of his time taking care of his estate at Northanger Abbey. Strict on punctuality and determined to \"keep a tight ship\", within his household, General Tilney is by nature inflexible, and has absolute distaste for anyone or anything that disrupts his schedule or breaks his sense of order. Some may speculate as to whether or not his difficult personality is due to his losing his wife years earlier (the wife died when Eleanor was a child), and being burdened with raising his children alone; however, what is certain, is that he is rude not only towards his children, but also in his poor treatment of Catherine. Throughout the novel, General Tilney keeps his focus on the advancement and social acceptance of his family, making this his top priority, even in terms of marriage. Essentially, General Tilney is so concerned with his family's name and fortune, that he tries to control who his children can and cannot marry, especially with regard to Henry's love for Catherine. Due to the misguided rumours from John Thorpe, General Tilney's perception of Catherine changes in that he once held her in high esteem, thinking that she came from a wealthy family; however, when a spurned John Thorpe later tells General Tilney that Catherine's family is essentially destitute, he denies Henry's marriage proposal to Catherine. Eventually, after his daughter's marriage to a nobleman, General Tilney's anger subsides, and when he discovers the truth in that Catherine does in fact descend from a modestly well-off family, he finally consents to Henry and Catherine's marriage. Upon further analysis, General Tilney's behaviour and attitude brings our attention to the social concerns that were common during Jane Austen's time period.\nEleanor Tilney: She is the younger sister of Frederick and Henry Tilney, and the daughter of the tyrannical General Tilney. Making her visit to the city of Bath at a later time, her friendship with Catherine Morland begins midway through the novel; however, despite this delay, she is sweet, kind, and humble like her brother Henry, and proves herself to be a much more loyal friend to Catherine, than Isabella ever was. Unfortunately, her role in Bath is not as significant as she spends the majority of her time acting as a chaperone for Catherine and Henry, but things take a turn for the better when they all make their journey back to Northanger Abbey. Because of Catherine and Eleanor's friendship, and due to Henry's love interest, Catherine is invited to stay with them in Northanger Abbey, to which they use this opportunity to get to know each other better on a personal level. This is the point where Eleanor explains the reason for her mother's absence, to which we discover that Mrs. Tilney had died due to a serious illness, leaving Mr. Tilney with three children to raise by himself. Other than her friendship with Catherine and their time spent together in Northanger Abbey, Eleanor plays no other role throughout the novel, except for the fact that she persuades her father to grant Catherine and Henry permission to marry.\nFrederick Tilney: He is the older brother of Henry Tilney and Eleanor Tilney, and the presumed heir to the Northanger estate. Frederick is an officer in the army, who takes advantage of women with his handsome and fashionable looks, pursuing flirtations with pretty girls who are willing to offer him some encouragement (though without any serious intent on his part). This is evident throughout his interactions with Isabella Thorpe as mentioned by Henry when describing his brother's personality to Catherine when he states that \"Frederick is a lively, and perhaps sometimes a thoughtless young man; he [Frederick] has had about a week\u2019s acquaintance with your friend [Isabella], and he has known her engagement almost as long as he has known her,\" (19.26). However, Frederick takes his interactions with Isabella a step further, and manages to sabotage her engagement with Catherine's brother James Morland. Known as \"The Captain\", Frederick represents Society's dual standards for behavior for men and women both. He also adds to the mystique of the Tilney family: Like father, Like son. Frederick's actions make Henry and Eleanor more sympathetic characters and his ruining of Isabella does the same for her character. Essentially, many readers perceive Frederick as nothing but selfish, greedy, and conniving.\nMr. Allen: Although his role is minimal in the story, he is a gruff but kind man, who is tolerant of Mrs. Allen's dim-witted behavior.&lt;ref name=\"Mr. Allen/Character Analysis\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He allows Catherine and his wife to accompany him in Bath, where he is being treated for gout. He often takes on a paternal role, serving as a guardian figure to Catherine, especially when he takes an interest in her love affair with Henry Tilney, being noted as \"taken pains to know who her partner was\", after their first meeting. Mr. Allen approves of the pair, as Tilney's reputation impresses him.\nMrs. Allen: A very dim-witted, childless woman, Mrs. Allen is a neighbor of the Morlands&lt;ref name=\"Mrs. Allen/Character Analysis\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; who invites Catherine to accompany her and her husband to Bath for a holiday. She thinks about nothing but clothing and how much it costs, and remembers very little from most conversations, merely repeating things that those around her say back to them. Supposed to serve as a guardian to Catherine during the trip to Bath, Mrs. Allen is too incapable of independent thought to properly guide Catherine through social situations. She runs into Mrs. Thorpe, a woman she knew fifteen years before at boarding school, which leads to her and Catherine spending much of their time in Bath with the Thorpes.\nComposition.\nAccording to notes written by Austen's sister Cassandra after Jane's death in 1817, the novel was finished by 1798 or 1799. The close resemblance in style to Austen's \"juvenilia\" of the early 1790s together with several in-jokes that only the Austen family could have appreciated strongly suggests that the book was begun during that period, probably about 1794. However, the references to several Gothic novels published after 1794 would indicate Austen did not finish the book until about 1798 or 1799 as Cassandra Austen remembered. The scholar Cecil Emden argued that differences between the Catherine portrayed in the Bath section of the novel vs. the Catherine at Northanger Abbey were due to Austen finishing the book at a different stage of her life than when she started.\nMajor themes.\nAs in all of Austen's novels, the subjects of society, status, behavior, and morality are addressed. \"Northanger Abbey\", however, being chronologically the first novel completed by Austen (though revised later in her life), and notably considered a \"point of departure\" from her other work as a result of the \"boldness with which it flaunts its . . . deceptive air of simplicity with broad, bold humour\".\nLove, marriage and high society.\nWhen Catherine enters Bath, she is rather unaware of the societal setting she will encounter. The text notes that her mother, also, knew little of high society, which explains why Austen pairs Catherine with the Allens, who are higher ranked in society than she, due to their wealth. Society greatly influences partner selection, especially in \"Northanger Abbey\", as General Tilney, for example, disapproves of Henry and Catherine's love due to their disparity in wealth. General Tilney only accepts Henry and Catherine's marriage after Eleanor Tilney becomes engaged to a wealthy man. Further, Catherine distances herself from John Thorpe, though he is societally deemed a \"good\" match for her. Rather, Catherine bravely situates love and companionship as more worthy than standing and rank, unlike Isabella, who ends the novel with two broken engagements.\nLife lived as in a Gothic novel.\nThough Austen greatly encourages the reading of novels to her readers, Catherine must learn to separate life from fiction, and rein in her very active imagination. When Catherine accuses General Tilney of murdering or locking up his wife, she is humiliated when it is discovered to be untrue, as Henry chastises her, by saying: \"'You had formed a surmise of such horror as I have hardly words to\u2014 Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from?'\" Upon this, Catherine is mortified, and distraught at the notion that Henry would think less of her for her wild assumptions. When reflecting, Catherine identifies that she must separate Gothic novels from her judgement of everyday life. This serves as a major progression in the novel, as it is a sign of Catherine's maturation and ability to appreciate novels without immediately applying them to her behaviour and thoughts.\nBildungsroman.\nWhile Catherine controls her imagination, she simultaneously endures the reality of individuals not behaving in the manner they should. Most prominently, Catherine realizes she is not to rely upon others, such as Isabella, who are negatively influential on her, but to be single-minded and independent. Isabella, regardless of her engagement to James Morland, flirts with Frederick Tilney, breaks her engagement to James, is discarded by Frederick, and causes herself great shame. Catherine began to realize the wrongs of Isabella's influence when the Thorpes cause her to miss her appointment with Henry and Eleanor Tilney early on, but it is not until the shocking wrongdoing against her brother that Catherine entirely separates herself from their friendship, stating that she may never speak to Isabella again, and is not as upset as she thought she would be. As this scene takes place almost immediately after Catherine's lesson about Gothic novels, it is a clear sign of her increasing maturity.\nThe value of reading.\nIn one of Austen's narrator's boldest proclamations, the narrator of \"Northanger Abbey\" exclaims upon the significance of reading novels, writing: \"I will not adopt that ungenerous and impolitic custom so common with novel-writers, of degrading by their contemptuous censure the very performances, to the number of which they are themselves adding\u2014joining with their greatest enemies in bestowing the harshest epithets on such works, and scarcely ever permitting them to be read by their own heroine, who, if she accidentally take up a novel, is sure to turn over its insipid pages with disgust. Alas! If the heroine of one novel be not patronized by the heroine of another, from whom can she expect protection and regard? I cannot approve of it\". In this famous moment, Austen's narrator acknowledges the hypocrisy in insulting those who read novels. It is also made clear in this text that those who are considered \"good\" and well-educated read novels, such as Henry and Eleanor Tilney. John Thorpe, for example, who does not read novels, is the cad of the text. Furthermore, there is a distinction made between Catherine's imagination and childishness that encourages her fantasy of a murderous General Tilney, rather than it being a direct fault of the novel genre.\nThe importance of time.\nVarious scholars such as the French historian Michel Foucault and the British Marxist E.P. Thompson have argued the 18th century become the \"era of the clock\" as availability of mass-produced clocks and watches allowed time to be measured more accurately, leading to an increased emphasis on doing things on time that not existed before, marking the beginning of \"time discipline\" as Thompson called it. In what is seen as example of the new era of \"time discipline\", Austen frequently used clocks as symbol of General Tilney's authority over Northanger Abbey. Throughout the novel, General Tilney is checking his watch, and is most insistent that servants and his own family observe the clocks to see if they are doing things on time. During her time in Bath, Catherine had easy-going attitude to time, having no strict schedule and planning nothing in advance.\nIt is only Catherine meets Henry Tilney that the novel begins to speak of the importance of time, with Catherine having to check the clocks to see if she will be on time to meet him. However, after arriving at Northanger Abbey, Catherine discovers that General Tilney is constantly checking his watch and that everything at the abbey happens on a strict schedule, which is a marked difference from Catherine's lax attitude that she displayed in Bath. When Catherine is late to a dinner, General Tilney shows his displeasure by pacing back and forth in the dining room while frequently glancing at the clock. Because of the importance of staying on schedule, even when General Tilney is not around, clocks serve as a symbol of his power as Catherine finds herself checking what time it is all the time.\nAs the novel progresses, Catherine finds the discipline imposed by the clocks more and more oppressive, as she finds that she is living her life according to General Tilney's dictates and demands. Catherine compares General Tilney to a clock, as something inhuman and mechanical that operates with no regard to the human body. At one point, when Catherine receives a letter from her brother, she allows herself \"half a hour\u2019s free indulgence of grief and reflection\" before composing herself for dinner all the while watching the clock. When Catherine visits the kitchen, she notes that it is equipped with all manner of \"modern\" cooking equipment and that the cooks worked in an efficient manner like soldiers performing a drill, which reflects the General's wish to have everything ordered. Likewise, General Tilney's ownership of a glasshouse that allows rare tropical fruit like pineapples to be grown in England was a sign that he was extremely rich as only those in the highest income brackets could afford a glasshouse, which was a symbol of luxury in Regency England.\nPublication.\nAusten initially sold the novel, then titled \"Susan\", for \u00a310 to a London bookseller, Crosby &amp; Co. in 1803. This publisher did not print the work but held on to the manuscript. Austen reportedly threatened to take her work back from them, but Crosby &amp; Co responded that she would face legal consequences for reclaiming her text. In the spring of 1816, the bookseller sold it back to the novelist's brother, Henry Austen, for the same sum as they had paid for it. There is evidence that Austen further revised the novel in 1816\u20131817 with the intention of having it published. She rewrote sections, renaming the main character Catherine and using that as her working title.\nAfter her death, Austen's brother Henry gave the novel its final name and arranged for publication of \"Northanger Abbey\" in late December 1817 (1818 given on the title page), as the first two volumes of a four-volume set, with a preface for the first time publicly identifying Jane Austen as the author of all her novels. Neither \"Northanger Abbey\" nor \"Persuasion\" was published under the working title Jane Austen used. Aside from first being published together, the two novels are not connected; later editions were published separately.\nReputation.\n\"Northanger Abbey\" and \"Persuasion\", published together posthumously in December 1817, were reviewed in the \"British Critic\" in March 1818 and in the \"Edinburgh Review and Literary Miscellany\" in May 1818. The reviewer for the \"British Critic\" felt that Austen's exclusive dependence on realism was evidence of a deficient imagination. The reviewer for the \"Edinburgh Review\" disagreed, praising Austen for her \"exhaustless invention\" and the combination of the familiar and the surprising in her plots. \nAusten scholars have pointed out that these early reviewers did not know what to make of her novels\u2014for example, they misunderstood her use of irony. Reviewers, for example, reduced \"Sense and Sensibility\" and \"Pride and Prejudice\" to didactic tales of virtue prevailing over vice.\nSatire.\nGothic novel, etc..\n\"Northanger Abbey\" is fundamentally a parody of Gothic fiction, which was especially popular during the 1790s and at the turn of the nineteenth century. Austen upends the conventions of eighteenth-century novels by making her heroine a plain and undistinguished girl from a middle-class family, allowing the heroine to fall in love with the hero before he has a serious thought of her, and exposing the heroine's romantic fears and curiosities as groundless. However, the British critic Robert Irvine wrote that though Catherine's specific fears that General Tilney murdered his wife are false, the book ends with her general fears of him being confirmed as his character is indeed vicious as the book says: \"Catherine, at any rate, heard enough to feel, that in suspecting General Tilney of either murdering or shutting up his wife, she had scarcely sinned against his character, or magnified his cruelty\". Likewise, the scholar Rachel Brownstein observed that Catherine's fears of General Tilney are in substance correct, though the book notes he turns out be a \"villain of common life\", not that of romance. Brownstein wrote that the conclusion the book invites is: \"...our heroine's instincts were good guides to truth\u2014perhaps even that they were good because they were informed by Gothic novels about vulnerable women persecuted by powerful men\".\nIrvine also points out that though parts of the book do satirize the Gothic novels popular in the 18th century, the interpretation of the novel as completely a satire of the Gothic genre is problematic. Irvine points out that, except in book II, the problems faced by Catherine are not caused by her reading Gothic novels, nor is Catherine's rejection of romantic love following Henry's outburst the climax, but instead is followed by Catherine being summarily expelled from Northanger Abbey after General Tilney discovers that she is not rich as he had been led to believe. Irvine observed that for Catherine her expulsion is a traumatic event that is equal in its emotional impact to the horrors that she had imagined General Tilney committing. Irvine also notes that the first chapters in the novel satirize the novels of Maria Edgeworth and Frances Burney, whom the novel ostensibly praises, as it does the Gothic novels. An early sign that Henry Tilney is the hero while John Thorpe is not can be seen in the fact that the former likes to read books while the latter does not.\nAusten was also influenced by \"The Female Quixote; or, The Adventures of Arabella\" (1752) a novel by Charlotte Lennox that was an imitation and parody of Miguel de Cervantes' \"Don Quixote\". It was approved by both Henry Fielding and Samuel Richardson, and applauded by Samuel Johnson. \nThe story begins with the narrator remarking that the heroine is not really a heroine, with the narrator saying Catherine was not especially clever, nor a great beauty, and good without being virtuous. The narrator goes to say the reader was expecting the heroine to be very virtuous, clever, and striking beautiful, which makes Catherine a \"strange, unaccountable character!\" Only with the second chapter does the narrator have anything positive to say about Catherine, which are even then still qualified by attaching the adjectives \"remarkable\" and extraordinary\", which is only meant ironically as what the narrator calls the \"extraordinary\" traits of Catherine are in fact quite ordinary, which seems to be Austen's way of satirizing how women were portrayed in contemporary literature. Austen's point appears to be what there is a gulf between how women really are and how they are portrayed in novels. The point is further emphasized by satirizing Richardson's rule laid out in \"The Rambler\" \"that no young lady can be justified in falling in love before the gentleman\u2019s love is declared\", which Catherine breaks without suffering. Later, when Catherine is feeling depressed, her mother tries unsuccessfully to cheer her up by having her read \"The Mirror\" (a popular journal in the late 18th century), which seems to be Austen's way of saying that what the moralising journals have to say is not applicable in real life.\nA reviewer in 2016 said \"Austen\u2019s \"Northanger Abbey\" was in part a playful response to what she considered \"unnatural\" in the novels of her day: Instead of perfect heroes, heroines and villains, she offers flawed, rounded characters who behave naturally and not just according to the demands of the plot.\"\nMasculine power: Johnson, Richardson, Blair and Addison.\nAt one point when Catherine uses the word \"nice\" in a way that Henry disapproves of, she is warned: \"The word 'nicest', as you use it, did not suit him; and you had better change it as soon as you can, or you shall be overpowered with Johnson and Blair all the rest of the way\". The popular 18th-century arbiters of style and taste such as Johnson, Richardson, Blair and Addison are presented as a canon of masculine power, which the novel is competition with at least as much as the Gothic novels, that were so popular with young women at the time. Irvine wrote that the way in which Henry frequently quotes these authors show he is just as much trapped in the world of the essays laying out rules of conduct and style as Catherine is influenced by the Gothic novels she loves to read. When Henry tries to dissuade Catherine of her Gothic-inspired notions that General Tilney is a murderer, he cites the (male) authors of the essays that were so influential in establishing rules of proper conduct, in short, is trying to dismiss one genre that was popular with women, with another genre that was popular with men. Irvine wrote that: \"The fact that the Gothic (and perhaps the novel in general) provides a means whereby young women can think for themselves is perhaps the real threat that Henry is countering here. After all, as we have seen, Catherine\u2019s fantasy proves to be a way of imagining as evil a truth about the General that Henry never criticises: the absolute nature of patriarchal power. The type of language that Henry uses does not originate with him: it is borrowed from the essays of Johnson, Blair and company, and gets its authority, its power over Catherine, from that masculine source\". Irvine contended that the discourse of the essays was a \"linguistic version of the patriarchal power of the General\", as a way of imposing power over women, not by locking them up in a room, but imposing a type of language that limits what one may think or not. In this sense, Henry speaks either with his \"natural tone\" when he is being himself and his \"affected\" tone, where he uses the discourse of a Johnsonian essay, which mirrors the description at the beginning of the book between the narrator's ideal heroine and Catherine.\nHowever, even when Henry is speaking with his natural tone, his speech is that expected of a polite society in Britain at the time. The ingenue Catherine, who has just arrived in Bath, is unfamiliar with the ways of a polite society, and is vaguely aware that Henry's \"affected\" tone is meant to be satirical, but is uncertain about what is the joke here. As a \"Bildungsroman\", Catherine has to learn the ways of polite society in order to fit in. Of her possible guides, Mrs. Allen is too dim to provide the necessary knowledge while John Thorpe, though from the gentry, is only interested in gambling and horses. With Thorpe, Austen makes the point that mere ownership of land does not make for a gentleman, as Thorpe is simply too vulgar to be a gentleman despite being of the gentry, which is further emphasised that when pays Catherine a compliment, she says it \"gives me no pleasure\" to receive a compliment from someone like him. Isabella Thorpe initially appears as Catherine's friend, but she proves herself an unworthy friend when she mentions to Catherine's brother James, much to the latter's mortification, that she is too fond of both the Tilneys. The way in which Isabella embarrasses Catherine is a violation of the major unwritten rules of polite society, namely the reciprocity principle that one should always think of the feelings of others. By contrast, Eleanor just conducts herself as a friend, albeit one who speaks in the same sort of language her brother mocks. Henry establishes himself as worthy of being Catherine's husband in his role as a \"lover mentor\" who teaches Catherine the ways of polite society to allow her to eventually fit in.\nAs part of the novel's satire of the literature of the day, the American scholar Rachel Brownstein noted that Henry Tilney is described as \"not quite handsome though very near it\", it is implied to be not quite entirely manly owing to his love of literature and fabrics, and is explicitly shown to be dominated by his father. It is General Tilney rather than his son who openly admires the attractions of Catherine's body, praising her for the \"elasticity of her walking, which in turn causing her to with great elasticity, though she had never thought of it before\". However, Brownstein wrote that Henry is the hero of the book as he constantly ridicules clich\u00e9 language, is able to understand the type of books read by women because he also reads them, and is able to rise above the crowd as notes the lazy language used by others who overuse words like \"amazingly\" and \"nice\". Another trope of the fiction of the day is satirized when Catherine first meets Henry at a dance and likes him right away, which in its turn causes him to pay attention to her for the first time. Most notably, it is the Thorpes who have to restrain Catherine from following Henry after the dance by holding her arms, which was not the sort of behavior that was expected of heroines in romantic novels at the time.\nFamily entertainment.\nAccording to Austen biographer Claire Tomalin \"there is very little trace of personal allusion in the book, although it is written more in the style of a family entertainment than any of the others\". Joan Aiken writes: \"We can guess that \"Susan\" [the original title of \"Northanger Abbey\"], in its first outline, was written very much for family entertainment, addressed to a family audience, like all Jane Austen\u2019s juvenile works, with their asides to the reader, and absurd dedications; some of the juvenilia, we know, were specifically addressed to her brothers Charles and Frank; all were designed to be circulated and read by a large network of relations.\"\nAllusions to other works.\nSeveral Gothic novels and authors are mentioned in the book, including Fanny Burney and \"The Monk\". Isabella Thorpe gives Catherine a list of seven books that are commonly referred to as the \"Northanger 'horrid' novels\". These works were later thought to be of Austen's own invention until the British writers Montague Summers and Michael Sadleir re-discovered in the 1920s that the novels actually did exist. The list is as follows:\nAll seven of these were republished by the Folio Society in London in the 1960s, and since 2005 Valancourt Books has released new editions of the \"horrids\", the seventh and final being released in 2015.\nThe Mysteries of Udolpho.\nThe most significant allusion, however, is to Ann Radcliffe's \"The Mysteries of Udolpho\", as it is the Gothic novel most frequently mentioned within this text. Notably, Jane Austen sold the manuscript of \"Northanger Abbey\" to the same firm that published Radcliffe's novel in 1794.\nThis outside text is first mentioned in Chapter Six, when Isabella and Catherine discuss the mystery \"behind the black veil\", and further establish their friendship based on their similar interests in novel genre, and their plans to continue reading other Gothic novels together. Austen further satirizes the novel through Catherine's stay at Northanger Abbey, believing that General Tilney has taken the role of Gothic novel villain.\nAusten's discussion of \"Udolpho\" is also used to clearly separate Catherine from John Thorpe, as when Catherine talks about the novel with him, he crudely responds that he \"never reads novels\", but qualifies his statement by arguing he would only read a novel by Ann Radcliffe, who, as Catherine then points out, is the author of \"Udolpho\". Here, Austen humorously categorizes \"Northanger Abbey\u2019s\" characters into two spheres: those who read novels, and those who do not. When Catherine and Henry Tilney later discuss reading novels, and Henry earnestly responds that he enjoys reading novels, and was especially titillated by \"Udolpho\", the match between Catherine and Henry is implied as both smart and fitting.\nAllusions to \"Northanger Abbey\".\nA passage from the novel appears as the preface of Ian McEwan's \"Atonement\", thus likening the naive mistakes of Austen's Catherine Morland to those of his own character Briony Tallis, who is in a similar position: both characters have very over-active imaginations, which lead to misconceptions that cause distress in the lives of people around them. Both treat their own lives like those of heroines in fantastical works of fiction, with Miss Morland likening herself to a character in a Gothic novel and young Briony Tallis writing her own melodramatic stories and plays with central characters such as \"spontaneous Arabella\" based on herself.\nRichard Adams quotes a portion of the novel's last sentence for the epigraph to Chapter 50 in his \"Watership Down\"; the reference to the General is felicitous, as the villain in \"Watership Down\" is also a General.\nJasper Fforde, in his alternate history comic fantasy novel \"First Among Sequels\", refers to \"Northanger Abbey\" as being under maintenance, and \"should be ready on time as long as Catherine stops attempting to have the book 'Gothicized'.\" It appears again as the prize in a reality program, based on the lives of the Bennets from \"Pride and Prejudice\".\nReference to baseball.\nThe book, also, contains an early historical reference to baseball. It is found in the first chapter of the novel, describing the interest of the heroine : \"Catherine, who had by nature nothing heroic about her, should prefer cricket, baseball, riding on horseback, and running about the country\". It is not the earliest known reference to the term, which is a 1744 British publication, \"A Little Pretty Pocket-Book\", by John Newbery, as described in Origins of baseball. The modern game is not described, but the term is used.\nAdaptations.\nLiterature.\nHarperCollins hired Scottish crime writer Val McDermid in 2012 to adapt \"Northanger Abbey\" for a modern audience, as a suspenseful teen thriller, the second rewrite in The Austen Project. McDermid said of the project, \"At its heart it\u2019s a teen novel, and a satire \u2013 that\u2019s something which fits really well with contemporary fiction. And you can really feel a shiver of fear moving through it. I will be keeping the suspense \u2013 I know how to keep the reader on the edge of their seat. I think Jane Austen builds suspense well in a couple of places, but she squanders it, and she gets to the endgame too quickly. So I will be working on those things.\" The novel was published in 2014.\nIn 2011, Marvel published a graphic novel version of \"Northanger Abbey\", adapted by Nancy Butler (writer), Janet K. Lee (artist) and Nick Filardi (color artist). The book, originally is the last of the Jane Austen adaptations made by Marvel, and contrarily to the other books of the series, is the only one to be released only in paperback, not in hardback.\nThe same year, author Jenni James published a modern teen version entitled \"Northanger Alibi\", published by Inkpress, in which the main character's obsession for Stephenie Meyer's \"Twilight saga\" replaces Catherine's love for Regency gothic novels.\n\"Newbury Acres: An Amish Retelling of Northanger Abbey\" (2017) by Sarah Price."}
{"title": "The_Absolutely_True_Diary_of_a_Part-Time_Indian", "label": "Book", "text": "The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian is a first-person narrative novel by Sherman Alexie, from the perspective of a Native American teenager, Arnold Spirit Jr., also known as \"Junior\", a 14-year-old promising cartoonist. The book is about Junior's life on the Spokane Indian Reservation and his decision to go to a nearly all-white public high school away from the reservation. The graphic novel includes 65 comic illustrations that help further the plot.\nAlthough critically acclaimed, \"The Absolutely True Diary\" has also been the subject of controversy and has consistently appeared on the annual list of frequently challenged books since 2008, becoming the most frequently challenged book from 2010 to 2019. Controversy stems from the novel's depiction of alcohol, poverty, bullying, violence, sexuality, profanity and slurs related to homosexuality and mental disability. As a result, dozens of schools have challenged it, and some schools have banned the book from school libraries or inclusion in curricula.\nPlot.\nThe book follows a fourteen-year-old Arnold Spirit Jr., also known as \"Junior\", living with his family on the Spokane Indian Reservation near Wellpinit, Washington. It is told in diary style, moving from the start of the school year to the beginning of summer. It includes both Junior's written record of his life and his cartoon drawings, some of them comically commenting on his situations, and others more seriously depicting important people in his life. \"The Absolutely True Diary\" begins by introducing Junior's birth defects: he was born with hydrocephalus and therefore is small for his age and suffers from seizures, poor eyesight, stuttering, and a lisp. As a result, Junior has always been picked on by other people on the reservation. Junior's family is extremely poor and has limited access to opportunities. When Junior's dog Oscar gets a heat stroke, his father must put him down (by, tragically, shooting him) because they cannot afford to take him to a veterinarian. Junior's only friend is his best friend Rowdy, who is abused at home and is known as a bully on the reservation. Despite his intimidating role, Rowdy often stands up for Junior and they bond by enjoying kids' comics.\nJunior's first day of high school is pivotal to the plot of the novel. When Mr. P, his geometry teacher, passes him his textbook, he sees his mother's name in it and realizes how old the book must be. Angered and saddened by the fact that the reservation is so poor that it cannot afford new textbooks, Junior violently throws the book, which hits Mr. P's face, breaking his nose. When he visits Junior at home, Mr. P convinces Junior to transfer to Reardan High School, sensing a degree of precociousness in the young teenager. The town of Reardan is far wealthier than Wellpinit\u2014Junior is the only Indian at Reardan. Although Junior's family is poor, and although the school is 22 miles away and transportation is unreliable, they support him and do what they can to make it possible for him to stay in the new school. Rowdy, however, is upset by Junior's decision to transfer, and the once-best friends have very little contact during the year.\nJunior develops a crush on the school's most popular white girl, Penelope, and becomes study friends with an intelligent student named Gordy. His interactions with the white students give him a better perspective both on white culture and his own. He realizes how much stronger his family ties are than those of his white classmates, noticing that many of the white fathers never come to their children's school events. Junior also realizes that the white students have different rules than those he grew up with, which is evident when he reacts to an insult from the school's star athlete, Roger, by punching him in the face. Junior hit him, as he would have been expected to do on the reservation, and he expects Roger to get revenge. But Roger never does; in fact, Roger and his friends show Junior more respect. Junior also gets closer to Penelope, which makes him more popular with the other girls at the school.\nRoger suggests that Junior try out for the basketball team, and to Junior's surprise, he makes the varsity team, which pits him against his former school, Wellpinit, and specifically Rowdy, who is Wellpinit's star freshman and has been leading them to first place. Their first match demonstrates to Junior just how angry the reservation people are at him for transferring: when he enters the court, they boo and insult him. During the game, Rowdy elbows Junior in the head and knocks him unconscious and one of the fans throws a coin at Junior. While suffering some injuries from the game, Junior and his coach become closer as Coach tells him that he admires Junior's commitment to the team. Later on, his grandmother, whom Junior looks up to the most on the reservation, is hit and killed by a drunk driver. After his grandmother's funeral, a family friend, Eugene, is shot in the face by his friend Bobby while drunk after fighting over alcohol. After grieving and reflecting on his loved ones' deaths, Junior plays in his basketball team's second match against Wellpinit. Reardan wins and Junior gets to block Rowdy. Junior feels triumphant until he sees the Wellpinit players' faces after their defeat and remembers the difficulties they face at home and their lack of hope for a future; ashamed, he runs to the locker room, where he vomits and then breaks down in tears. Later, Junior receives news of the death of his sister and her husband who were killed in a fire at their trailer.\nIn the course of the year, Junior and his family suffered many tragedies, many related to alcohol abuse. These events test Junior's sense of hope for a better future and make him wonder about the darker aspects of reservation culture. Furthermore, the protagonist is torn between the need to fit in his new, all-white school and holding on to his Indian heritage, leading him to face criticism from his own community. Despite these challenges, they also help him see how much his family and his new friends love him, and he learns to see himself as both Indian and American. Meanwhile, Rowdy realizes that Junior is the only nomad on the reservation, which makes him more of a \"traditional\" Indian than everyone else in town. In the end, Junior and Rowdy reconcile while playing basketball and resolve to correspond no matter where the future takes them.\nBackground.\n\"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" is semi-autobiographical. The novel started as a section of Sherman Alexie's family memoir, but after the persistence of a young adult editor, he decided to use it as a basis for his first young adult novel. Sherman Alexie commented, \"If I were to guess at the percentage, it would be about seventy-eight percent true.\" Like Arnold, Sherman Alexie grew up on the Spokane Reservation in Wellpinit with an alcoholic father. He was also born with hydrocephalus, but Alexie did not have any speech impediments. Alexie was also teased for his government-issued, horn-rimmed glasses and nicknamed \"The Globe\" by fellow students because of his giant head. Another similarity between Alexie and his character Arnold is that Alexie also left the reservation to attend high school at Reardan High, but Alexie chose to go to Reardan to achieve the required credits he needed to go to college. Alexie became the star player of Reardan's basketball team and was the only Indian on the team besides the school's team mascot. The scene where Arnold finds that he is using the same textbook his mother did thirty years before he is drawn from Alexie's own experiences. The only difference between Alexie's life and the novel is that Alexie threw the book against the wall out of anger, and did not hit anyone as Junior did.\nIn his own writing, Alexie unapologetically describes himself as \"kind of mixed up, kind of odd, not traditional. I'm a rez kid who's gone urban, and that's what I write about. I have never pretended to be otherwise.\" \"A smart Indian is a dangerous person,\" Alexie states in a personal essay, \"[a smart Indian is] widely feared and ridiculed by Indians and non-Indians alike.\" Junior encapsulates this type of experience when he receives strong censure both from his tribal community and from his peers and teachers at his new school, Reardan. In the personal story, Alexie's continued explanation of his own experience is reflected in Junior's. Alexie recalls, \"I fought with my classmates on a daily basis. They wanted me to stay quiet when the non-Indian teacher asked for answers\u2026.[W]e were Indian children who were expected to be stupid. \u2026[W]e were expected to fail in the non-Indian world.\" Through Junior's success at Reardan and his realizations about life on the reservation, Alexie represents a possibility for the success of Native American children\u2014by defeating the expectation that he is doomed to fail, Junior defeated what he thought he couldn't. Alexie's reflections again demonstrate that Junior's experiences are semi-autobiographical.\nA Spokane Indian, Agnes has lived on the reservation her entire life. She is a bad liar, likes to read books, and is considered to be very smart by her children. She is an ex-alcoholic and is seen as eccentric by Junior: \"She's a human tape recorder,\" Junior explains, \"Really, my mom can read the newspaper in fifteen minutes and tell me baseball scores, the location of every war, the latest guy to win the lottery, and the high temperature in Des Moines, Iowa.\"\nAn alcoholic, but very supportive. Even though he sometimes disappears, he tries to take care of his family and he often drives Junior to Reardan. He plays the piano, the guitar, and the saxophone. He could have been a jazz musician, given more time and money.\n Nicknamed Junior, Arnold is a fourteen-year-old boy who lives on the Spokane Indian Reservation. He enjoys playing basketball and drawing cartoons in his free time. Junior and his family, along with the others on the reservation, feel the daily effects of poverty and financial shortcomings\u2014there is often not enough food to eat in their home or enough money to fill the gas tank in the car, forcing him to hitchhike to school or not go at all. He is incredibly smart; he transfers from the school on the reservation to Reardan, where almost all the students are white.\nThe coach of the basketball team at Reardan High School. Unlike the teachers who are apprehensive of Junior's attendance at Reardan, the coach pays no attention to Junior's race. He is supportive of Junior both on and off the court. The coach becomes a father figure for Junior in many ways, but also becomes an exemplary friend, helping Junior through difficult times dealing with playing against his home reservation. The novel never gives a name to him, as he is always referred to as coach.\nWhen Arnold Spirit was twelve years old, he loved this girl. She was his first crush. He thought about Dawn when he said to Rowdy that he loved Penelope.\nThe best friend of Junior's father. \"Eugene was a nice guy, and like an uncle to me, but he was drunk all the time,\" Junior reveals. He becomes an Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) for the tribal ambulance service, and, for a brief time, drives a 1946 Indian Chief Roadmaster. Eugene dies after his close friend Bobby shoots him in the face during a dispute over alcohol. Bobby hangs himself in jail.\nGordy is a student who attends Reardan, wears glasses, and does everything in the name of science. Gordy always speaks in a sophisticated and proper manner throughout the novel. He is one of the smartest students at the school and he eventually becomes Junior's first real friend at Reardan. Gordy also helps Junior with schoolwork and encourages his enjoyment of reading books.\nJunior's Grandma. She is Junior's source of advice and support until she dies after being hit by a drunk driver while walking on the side of the road on her way home after a powwow. Her dying words were \"Forgive him,\" which meant that she wanted her family to forgive the drunk driver, Gerald, for hitting and killing her. Ironically, she never had a drink in her life. She was also extremely tolerant and loving of all people. Junior's grandma is his favorite person in the world. \"My grandmother's last act on earth was a call for forgiveness, love, and tolerance,\" Junior recalls on page 157.\nJunior's sister. Mary has long hair and is nicknamed \"Mary Runs Away\". She likes to write romance stories and is considered by Junior to be \"beautiful and strong and funny\". She was smart, but did not have the skills to get a job. After high school, she did not go to college or get a job; instead, she moved to Montana with her new husband she met at the reservation casino. Mary and her new husband die of a fire in their trailer home after a partygoer forgot about a boiling pot of soup. A curtain drifted onto the hot plate and the trailer was quickly engulfed. Junior was told that Mary never woke up because she was too drunk.\nMelinda works in the office of Reardan High School. She is 50 years old.\nCharacters.\nJunior's white geometry teacher at Wellpinit High School. He mentored Mary, Junior's older sister, and wants to help Junior leave the reservation. Mr. P regrets the way he treated his students when he was younger. He had been taught to beat the Indian out of the children. He is short and bald, and incredibly absent-minded. He often forgets to come to school, but \"he doesn't expect much of [his students].\" A major turning point in \"Diary\"s plot occurs when Junior throws his math book at Mr. P after a realization about the reservation's poverty.\nJunior's crush and good friend from Reardan High. She has blonde hair and Junior thinks that she is very attractive. She enjoys helping others, is bulimic, and has a racist father named Earl. She is popular and plays on the Reardan volleyball team. She is obsessed with leaving the small town behind and traveling the world. She initially decides to be close with Junior, fed up with the conformity of the town; but closer to the end of the novel, she \"does\" become Junior's girlfriend.\nRoger is a jock at Reardan High School. Upon meeting Junior, Roger uses racial slurs to demean him, and eventually it gets so racist that Junior retaliates by punching him in the face. Contrary to Junior's expectations, Roger then begins to respect Junior, and the two gradually become friends. Furthermore, Roger obtains a role as a kind of advisor and protector of Junior, occasionally helping him monetarily and other times with advice.\nRowdy is Junior's best friend. He is \"long and lean &amp; strong like a snake.\" Throughout the novel, Rowdy's father abuses him, which leads to his bully-like behavior. He likes reading comics, such as Archie. The comics help him escape the troubles of the real world. Junior and Rowdy have been the best of friends since they were little, and Rowdy has often taken on the role of Junior's protector. However, as Junior leaves the reservation school, Rowdy feels betrayed by his best friend and turns into Junior's \"arch nemesis\" during the novel. Even though Rowdy develops a passionate hatred for Junior through the betrayal he felt, they are able to eventually overcome their situation and become friends again by the end of the novel.\nThis billionaire came to Grandmother Spirits funeral to give back a powwow dancing outfit. But it was not an outfit from the Spokane Indians so he drove away.\nReception.\nReviews.\nBruce Barcott of \"The New York Times\" said in a 2007 review, \"For 15 years now, Sherman Alexie has explored the struggle to survive between the grinding plates of the Indian and white worlds. He's done it through various characters and genres, but \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" may be his best work yet. Working in the voice of a 14-year-old forces Alexie to strip everything down to action and emotion, so that reading becomes more like listening to your smart, funny best friend recount his day while waiting after school for a ride home.\"\n\"The New York Times\" opined that this was Alexie's \"first foray into the young adult genre, and it took him only one book to master it.\" \"The San Francisco Chronicle\" praised it as \"[a] great book full of pain, but luckily, the pain is spiked with joy and humor.\"\nReviewers also commented on Alexie's treatment of difficult issues. Delia Santos, a publisher for the \"civilrights.org\" page, noted, \"Alexie fuses words and images to depict the difficult journey many Native Americans face. \u2026 Although Junior is a young adult, he must face the reality of living in utter poverty, contend with the discrimination of those outside of the reservation, cope with a community and a family ravaged and often killed by alcoholism, break cultural barriers at an all-White high school, and maintain the perseverance needed to hope and work for a better future.\" Andrew Fersch, a publisher for \"Vail Daily\", commented, \"most folks block out most of their teenage memory, [while] Alexie embraced it with humor.\"\nIn another review published in November 2016 by \"Dakota Student\" website, author Breanna Roen says that she has never seen the way that this book, \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\", conveys so much happiness, love, and grief. Alexie's work in this novel can't be compared to other Native American books; it is \"a whole different ball game,\" Roen asserts. The review continues to state that the theme regarding identity, home, race, poverty, tradition, friendship, hope and success is seen throughout the entire book, leaving the readers on the edge of their seats and wanting more. Roen says that she could hardly put the book down and is avidly looking for something similar.\nIn the review, \"A Brave Life: The Real Struggles of a Native American Boy make an Uplifting Story\" published in \"The Guardian,\" author Diane Samuels says that Alexie's book has a \"combination of drawings, pithy turns of phrase, candor, tragedy, despair and hope \u2026 [that] makes this more than an entertaining read, more than an engaging story about a North American Indian kid who makes it out of a poor, dead-end background without losing his connection with who he is and where he's from.\" In some areas, Samuels criticizes Alexie's stylistic reliance on the cartoons. However, she continues to say that for the most part, Sherman Alexie has a talent for capturing the details and overview in a well-developed and snappy way. Samuels finishes her review by stating that: \"Opening this book is like meeting a friend you'd never make in your actual life and being given a piece of his world, inner and outer. It's humane, authentic and, most of all, it speaks.\"\nIn the review \"Using \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" to Teach About Racial Formation,\" Miami University professor Kevin Talbert says that Alexie chose to narrate the story through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Junior to transport his readers into \"uncomfortable or incongruent spaces.\" He continues to say that the novel's writing allows for topics about class and racial struggles to be intertwined with more common adolescent struggles like sexual desires, controlling hormones, and managing relationships with friends and family. Furthermore, Talbert believes that, unlike other Young Adult novels, this book captures issues of race and class in a way that reaches a wider audience. The article also states that Junior's narration in the novel sends a message to society, \"that adolescents have important things to say, that being fourteen years old matters.\"\nCritical interpretation.\nDr. Bryan Ripley Crandall, director of the Connecticut Writing Project at Fairfield University, posits in his critical essay \"Adding a Disability Perspective When Reading Adolescent Literature: Sherman Alexie's \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\"\" that the book presents a progressive view of disability. Arnold has what he calls \"water on the brain\", which would correctly be referred to as hydrocephalus. Crandall points out that Arnold is never held back by his disability, but in fact laughs at himself: \"With my big feet and pencil body, I looked like a capital L walking down the road.\" According to Crandall, the illustrations by Ellen Forney, which are meant to be the cartoons that Arnold draws, represent a new way for the disabled narrator to communicate with the readers: they \"initiate further interpretations and conversations about how students perceive others who are not like them, especially individuals with disabilities.\" Arnold's hydrocephaly doesn't prevent him from becoming a basketball star at his new school. His disability fades as a plot device as the book progresses.\nDavid Goldstein, in his paper \"Sacred Hoop Dreams: Basketball in the Work of Sherman Alexie\", analyses the importance of basketball in the novel. He suggests that it represents \"the tensions between traditional lifeways and contemporary social realities.\" According to Goldstein, Junior/Arnold sees losing at basketball as \"losing at life.\" The Reardan kids are eternal winners because of their victories on the court: \"Those kids were magnificent.\" Goldstein notes how basketball is also a sport of poverty in America \u2014 \"it costs virtually nothing to play, and so is appropriate for the reservation.\"\nNerida Weyland's article, \"Representations of Happiness in Comedic Young Adult Fiction: Happy Are the Wretched\" describes how Junior/Arnold is an example of the complex, not-innocent child often presented in modern young adult literature. As detailed in Alyson Miller's \"Unsuited to Age Group: The Scandals of Children's Literature,\" society has created an \"innocence of the idealized child\"; Alexie's protagonist is the opposite of this figure.\nAccording to Weyland, Alexie doesn't play by the rules \u2013 the use of humor in the book is directed at established \"power hierarchies, dominant social ideologies or topics deemed taboo\". Weyland suggests that the outsized effect of this feature of the book is revealed in the controversy its publication caused, as it was banned and challenged in schools all over the country. Weyland states that Alexie's book with Forney's black-comedy illustrations explore themes of \"racial tension, domestic violence, and social injustice\" in a never-before-done way. As an example, Alexie uses the anecdote of the killing of Junior's dog, Oscar, to expand on the idea of social mobility, or lack thereof \u2013 Junior states that he understood why the dog had to be killed rather than taken to the vet, because his parents were poor and they \"came from poor people who came from poor people who came from poor people, all the way back to the very first poor people.\" Weyland notes how readers are likely to be uncomfortable with Junior/Arnold/Alexie making light of topics of such importance (racism, poverty, alcoholism) through the use of dark comedy.\nAwards.\nAlexie won three major \"year's best\" awards for \"Diary\", a biannual award for books by and about Native Americans, and a California award that annually covers the last four years. The awards are listed below:\n\"Diary\" was also named to several annual lists including three by the United States' library industry (not including being banned).\nControversy.\n\"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" has been at the center of many controversies due to the book's themes and content, as well as its target audience of young adults. The book has both fervent supporters and concerned protesters: \"some people thought it was the greatest book ever, and some people thought it was the most perverted book ever,\" said Shawn Tobin, a superintendent of a Georgia school district.\nCensorship.\n\"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" was the most-challenged book in the United States from 2010 to 2019 and was named one of the top ten most challenged books in 2010 (2), 2011 (5), 2012 (2), 2013 (3), 2014 (1), 2017 (2), 2018 (9), and 2020 (5). The book has been challenged for the following reasons:\nLocal parents caught wind of the book's references to alcoholism, sensitive cultural topics, and sexual innuendos: at the beginning of June, seven Antioch parents attended a 117th District School Board meeting to request that the book be removed from the curriculum. However, the novel was not banned from Antioch High School's curriculum following the controversy. Instead, the English Department introduced an alternative option for summer reading\u2014students who preferred to read John Hart's \"Down River\" were permitted to do so.\nIn Prineville, Oregon one parent raised objections to the school board about how the book contains references to masturbation and is generally inappropriate. In response, the Crook County School District temporarily removed the book from classrooms. The removal was upheld, but the book remained available to students in school libraries.\nA parent complained to the Stockton School District Board about the violence, language, and sexual content. The board voted to ban the book from school libraries. The decision was voted upon multiple times, but the ban was ultimately upheld.\nIn 2010, Wyoming's Newcastle Middle School attempted to include \"Diary\" in its 8th grade English curriculum. At first, the district allowed it under the premise that children who were not allowed to read it would bring a signed paper allowing them to read the alternate book \"Tangerine\". About two weeks after the announcement was made to the 8th graders, the school board banned teaching it in a curriculum, but still allowed it in the library for those who wished to read it.\nIn 2011, one parent in the Helena School District objected to the book's \"obscene, vulgar, and pornographic language.\" However, the school district voted to retain the book in schools.\nIn 2011, a 9th grade Language Arts teacher at the Richland Public High School piloted \"Diary\" in his curriculum, and with the help of his students, reported to the school's board on the inclusion of the book in a high school curriculum. Parents of students in the class were notified ahead of time that the teacher was interested in the book; as a result, parents were able to opt their student out of reading the novel if they so chose.\nIn June 2011, the school board voted 3\u20132 to remove the book from the school entirely. Board members had not read the book but cited the split Instructional Materials Committee vote as the reason to ban the novel.\nThe board members later learned that some members of the Instructional Materials Committee had not read the book, and so the board members agreed to vote again, but read it for themselves before the vote. On July 11, 2011, the school board voted 4\u20131 to reverse its earlier decision.\nIn 2012, the book was removed from the Dade County school libraries and required high school reading lists due to complaints about \"vulgarity, racism, and anti-Christian content\".\nIn 2012 in the Old Rochester Regional Junior High School, the book was challenged as an 8th grade English assignment, but ultimately retained by the school.\nIn 2012, the book was challenged in 9th grade English classes in Westfield High School for \"very sensitive material in the book including excerpts on masturbation among other explicit sexual references, encouraging pornography, racism, religious irreverence, and strong language.\" However, the school board decided to retain the book as part of the curriculum.\nSherman Alexie's \"Diary\" was challenged in his home state of Washington, only a few hours drive away from where the semi-autobiographical work is set. The dispute over the book's appropriateness for high school students took place in the West Valley School District in 2013. Specifically, many parents claimed that the book contains inappropriate and sexual content and language that are unsuitable for high school students.\nAs of now, there have been four official complaints about the book that have been recorded. Resultantly, Alexie's book was removed from 10th-grade classes and made supplemental literature for 11th and 12th grades, instead of required reading.\nA middle school in Queens removed \"Diary\" from required reading due to the references to masturbation, which the school considered inappropriate for middle schoolers.\nThe book was challenged on the 10th grade reading list at Skyview High School, where a parent complained, \"This book is, shockingly, written by a Native American who reinforces all the negative stereotypes of his people and does it from the crude, obscene, and unfiltered viewpoint of a 9th-grader growing up on the reservation.\" The book was not removed from the school list.\nA Jefferson County parent complained about the novel's graphic nature, resulting in the book being pulled from all county schools.\nSome parents of students of a Sweet Home Junior High English class voiced concerns about the book's content, specifically the objectification of women and young girls. The concerns resulted in the book being officially challenged.\nIn April 2014, \"Diary\" was pulled from the Meridian district's supplemental reading list after significant parental disapproval of the novel's subject matter. The book had been a part of its curriculum since 2010. Students protested to remove the ban but were unsuccessful.\nAccording to Marshall University Libraries, in 2015 the text was banned from the Meridian (ID) school districts' required texts due to parents complaining that it \"discusses masturbation, contains profanity, and has been viewed as anti-Christian.\"\nOn July 1, 2014, a grandmother in Brunswick, North Carolina, filed a complaint against \"Diary\" at Cedar Grove Middle School. Two weeks later, the school's Media Advisory Committee met and unanimously agreed to keep the book in its curriculum because the committee saw the value in \"the realistic depiction of bullying and racism, as well as a need for tolerance and awareness of cultural differences.\" The grandmother, Frances Wood, appealed the decision, remaining adamant that \"[t]his book is not morally acceptable\u2026 Everything in it is degrading. There's nothing uplifting in it.\"\nOne year later, Wood challenged the book yet again, this time at West Brunswick High School. Wood lost this protest against the book when the principal of West Brunswick High School responded a few days later that the county school board's policy was that their decision on a book held for all schools in the county, and that those decisions could not be revisited for two years.\nIn 2015, the superintendent of the Highland Park Independent School District suspended \"Diary\" from the school approved book list. The suspension was very brief, and the superintendent reinstated the book soon after.\nIn 2020, the book was assigned to an 8th grade English Language Arts class at Farragut Middle School. Upon a passage containing the N-word and fornication with an animal being read aloud in class without adequate preparation by the teacher, it was reported that this caused \"psychological harm\" to an African American student and that members of the school community felt \"uncomfortable and marginalized while reading and discussing this book.\" It was decided to immediately stop discussion of the book to prevent further harm. The book will the re-evaluated by the English department for future use.\nDefense of the novel.\nAlexie has defended the novel by emphasizing the positive learning opportunities readers gain from exposure to these harsh aspects of contemporary life. He describes his own experience of adults trying to hide and protect him from suffering and hardship: \nAlexie said that students were also able to connect his story to their own difficult experiences with \"depression, attempted suicide, gang warfare, sexual and physical abuse, absentee parents, poverty, racism, and learning disabilities\". He noted:\nThe book has been credited with addressing the experiences and issues faced by Native American students in the public school system.\nSome have even discussed the merits of the book while also mentioning the risks of exposing children to the harsher scenes. In an essay on censorship, young adult fiction author Raquel Rivera wrote:\nHistorical trauma of the Spokane Indians.\nThe autobiographical nature of the novel reflects the internal struggle for identity that Alexie dealt with as a child. His personal experiences then tie into the idea of the trauma that Native American tribes live with as they still struggle to balance assimilation with identity. This phenomenon has been explored and analyzed since the publication of the novel.\nJan Johnson, clinical assistant professor of American Indian and African American Literatures at the University of Idaho, utilizes Alexie's novel to explore the idea of marginalization and oppression in Native American communities in her article, \"Healing The Soul Wound\". Johnson identifies the \"soul wound,\" the deep-seated trauma Native Americans have endured since colonization and continue to struggle with. This term explains how the consistent depiction of Native American people as suffering and helpless has become ingrained into their identity. Johnson writes, \"Alexie feels that\u2014as a result of this grim history\u2014suffering and trauma are fundamental to the experience of being Native American. Ceaseless suffering attains an epistemological status.\" Johnson uses the novel to illustrate her thoughts about the future of the Native American culture. The Spokane Indians, and tribes like them, face the trauma of searching for an identity in a world that attempts to envelop one's culture. Johnson argues that Alexie uses \"Diary\" to represent the potential for healing the traumas that Native American tribes have faced throughout history.\nIn \"Sherman Alexie, A Collection of Critical Essays\", critics Jeff Burglund and Jan Roush interpret Jan Johnson's definition of the soul wound as \"intergenerational suffering.\" On pages 10 and 11 of \"Diary\", Alexie elaborates on the concept of generational poverty when he reveals that Junior's family is too poor to care for the family's sick dog: \"My parents came from poor people who came from poor people who came from poor people, all the way back to the very first poor people,\" he writes. Junior is \"wounded,\" which Alexie shows through Junior's alcoholic father, his misguided sister, and his defeating social life. Through \"Diary\", Alexie aims to make a larger statement about the need for change in both the internal structure and the external perception of Native American communities in the United States. Columbus and his men colonized the new land they encountered in horrid ways that diminished Native people of anything they had. Violent invasions by Columbus and his crew left the Indians with nothing to call their own. Sacred land, animals, plants, and relatives were all lost during the time of what Maria Yellow Brave Heart and Lemyra DeBruyn called the \"American Indian Holocaust.\" The ones that were somewhat fortunate enough to stay alive were brainwashed of everything they knew, and were forced to believe and follow the religious practices of the Christian faith despite the fact it was not what they believed in. The Indians were also forced to relocate and leave everything, which led to many of them dying due to illness or unbearable conditions they had to walk in. Some Native peoples are still affected by this trauma. Many argue that \"historical unresolved grief\" is the cause of high crime rates and mental health issues among Native American people today. Maria Yellow Horse Brave Heart and Lemyra DeBruyn explain the meaning behind \"historical disenfranchised grief\" and how it is overlooked by Americans. American Indians are experiencing disenfranchised grief because of how this group of people was and still is seen as savage, emotionless, and lacking of right or reason to mourn and grieve.\nMulticultural literature.\nThere are many arguments for why \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" is an example of multicultural literature. A textbook called \"Sherman Alexie in the Classroom\" was recently published in order to help teachers and educators explore how multicultural texts can impact the learning outcome of students\u2013\u2013especially for Native Americans in the modern times. This text explores the significance and the message behind the works of Sherman Alexie, including poetry, novels, films strips, and much more.\n\"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" is a multicultural text that many English teachers use in order to educate their students about the Native American heritage. The author, Alexie, himself is of the Spokane heritage, and as a result, he uses his own background and personal experiences to write this specific novel in a semi-autobiographical format. Teachers refer to the textbook, \"Sherman Alexie in the Classroom\", to claim that the book provides an opportunity to educate non-Native American students to \"work through their white guilt and develop anti-racist perspectives.\"\nIn an interview, Alexie stated that, \"The primary audience is college-educated white women, so that's who reads everything. If you want to talk about an indication of that--certainly this book is geared towards young adults, but I was at the American Library Association convention in DC a couple of weeks ago, and there were something like 15,000 librarians there and 99 percent of them were white women so ... Thank God ... they seem to be the people most willing to ignore barriers and boundaries and to reach across, so that's who my audience is in reality. In this book, specifically, I'm really hoping it reaches a lot of native kids certainly, but also poor kids of any variety who feel trapped by circumstance, by culture, by low expectations, I'm hoping it helps them get out.\"\nAlexie also wants his \"literature to concern the daily lives of Indians. [He] think[s] most Native American literature is so obsessed with nature that [he doesn't] think it has any useful purpose\". Alexis was quoted saying, \"There's a kid out there, some boy or girl who will be that great writer, and hopefully they'll see what I do and get inspired by that\".\nFurthermore, Alexie's texts encourage educators to initiate discussions in their classrooms about the Native American culture as a whole. Many stereotypes of Native Americans exist in the United States; therefore, many people have erroneous views of what modern Native Americans' lives are like. 11th and 12th grade English teacher, Bryan Ripley Crandall, believes that learning about different cultural backgrounds creates a diverse learning environment. Crandall also states that the Native American narrative of Alexie's book is a way of giving minority students an access to their own background and heritage within an American education. Therefore, Alexie's multicultural literature of \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\" provides an expanded perspective of the daily lives of Native Americans living on the reservation in today's world.\nMedia.\nAudiobook.\nThe author Sherman Alexie himself narrates the audiobook of \"The Absolutely True Diary Of A Part-Time Indian\", which has won many awards for its creation of an idiosyncratic, first-person voice. \"Alexie is the perfect choice to read his own story,\" notes critic Kristi Jemtegaard. Alexie is able to convey the messages that the missing cartoons, caricatures, and sketches reveal in the printed text. Alexie, who has experience as an orator, won the Taos Poetry Circus World Heavyweight Championship award three years in a row for his oratorical virtuosity.\nFilm adaptation.\nAccording to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", in December 2016, Fox 2000 Pictures acquired the rights to produce \"The Absolutely True Diary of a Part-Time Indian\". The producing team consists of Hugh Jackman, Wyck Godfrey, Isaac Klausner, and Lauren Shuler Donner. The film is currently under development, and a set release date has not been announced as of yet.\nReferences.\nThe Absolutely True Diary\nOther"}
{"title": "Mars_trilogy", "label": "Book", "text": "The \"Mars\" trilogy is a series of science fiction novels by Kim Stanley Robinson that chronicles the settlement and terraforming of the planet Mars through the personal and detailed viewpoints of a wide variety of characters spanning almost two centuries. Ultimately more utopian than dystopian, the story focuses on egalitarian, sociological, and scientific advances made on Mars, while Earth suffers from overpopulation and ecological disaster.\nThe three novels are \"Red Mars\" (1992), \"Green Mars\" (1993), and \"Blue Mars\" (1996). \"The Martians\" (1999) is a collection of short stories set in the same fictional universe. \"Red Mars\" won the BSFA Award in 1992 and Nebula Award for Best Novel in 1993. \"Green Mars\" won the Hugo Award for Best Novel and Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel in 1994. \"Blue Mars\" also won the Hugo and Locus Awards in 1997.\n\"Icehenge\" (1984), Robinson's first novel about Mars, is not set in this universe but deals with similar themes and plot elements. The trilogy shares some similarities with Robinson's more recent novel \"2312\" (2012); for instance, the terraforming of Mars and the extreme longevity of the characters in both novels.\nPlot.\n\"Red Mars\"\u00a0\u2013 Colonization.\n\"Red Mars\" starts in 2026 with the first colonial voyage to Mars aboard the \"Ares\", the largest interplanetary spacecraft ever built and home to a crew who are to be the first hundred Martian colonists. The ship was built from clustered space shuttle external fuel tanks which, instead of reentering Earth's atmosphere, had been boosted into orbit until enough had been amassed to build the ship. The mission is a joint American\u2013Russian undertaking, and seventy of the First Hundred are drawn from these countries (except, for example, Michel Duval, a French psychologist assigned to observe their behavior). The book details the trip out, construction of the first settlement on Mars (eventually called Underhill) by Russian engineer Nadia Cherneshevsky, as well as establishing colonies on Mars' hollowed out asteroid-moon Phobos, the ever-changing relationships between the colonists, debates among the colonists regarding both the terraforming of the planet and its future relationship to Earth. The two extreme views on terraforming are personified by Saxifrage \"Sax\" Russell, who believes their very presence on the planet means some level of terraforming has already begun and that it is humanity's obligation to spread life as it is the most scarce thing in the known universe, and Ann Clayborne, who stakes out the position that humankind does not have the right to change entire planets at their will.\nRussell's view is initially purely scientific but in time comes to blend with the views of Hiroko Ai, the chief of the Agricultural Team who assembles a new belief system (the \"Areophany\") devoted to the appreciation and furthering of life (\"viriditas\"); these views are collectively known as the \"Green\" position, while Clayborne's naturalist stance comes to be known as \"Red.\" The actual decision is left to the United Nations Organization of Mars Affairs (UNOMA), which greenlights terraforming, and a series of actions get underway, including the drilling of \"moholes\" to release subsurface heat; thickening of the atmosphere according to a complicated bio-chemical formula that comes to be known as the \"Russell cocktail\" after Sax Russell; and the detonation of nuclear explosions deep in the sub-surface permafrost to release water. Additional steps are taken to connect Mars more closely with Earth, including the insertion of an areosynchronous asteroid \"Clarke\" to which a space elevator cable is tethered.\nAgainst the backdrop of this development is another debate, one whose principal instigator is Arkady Bogdanov of the Russian contingent (possibly named in homage to the Russian polymath and science fiction writer Alexander Bogdanov - it is later revealed in Blue Mars that Alexander Bogdanov is an ancestor of Arkady's.). Bogdanov argues that Mars need not and should not be subject to Earth traditions, limitations, or authority. He is to some extent joined in this position by John Boone, famous as the \"First Man on Mars\" from a preceding expedition and rival to Frank Chalmers, the technical leader of the American contingent. Their rivalry is further exacerbated by competing romantic interest in Maya Katarina Toitovna, the leader of the Russian contingent. (In the opening of the book, Chalmers instigates a sequence of events that leads to Boone being assassinated; much of what follows is a retrospective examination of what led to that point.)\nEarth meanwhile increasingly falls under the control of transnational corporations (transnats) that come to dominate its governments, particularly smaller nations adopted as \"flags of convenience\" for extending their influence into Martian affairs. As UNOMA's power erodes, the Mars treaty is renegotiated in a move led by Frank Chalmers; the outcome is impressive but proves short-lived as the transnats find ways around it through loop-holes. Things get worse as the nations of Earth start to clash over limited resources, expanding debt, and population growth as well as restrictions on access to a new longevity treatment developed by Martian scientists\u2014one that holds the promise of lifespans into the hundreds of years. In 2061, with Boone dead and exploding immigration threatening the fabric of Martian society, Bogdanov launches a revolution against what many now view as occupying transnat troops operating only loosely under an UNOMA rubber-stamp approval. Initially successful, the revolution proves infeasible on the basis of both a greater-than-expected willingness of the Earth troops to use violence and the extreme vulnerability of life on a planet without a habitable atmosphere. A series of exchanges sees the cutting of the space elevator, bombardment of several Martian cities (including the city where Bogdanov is himself organizing the rebellion; he is killed), the destruction of Phobos and its military complex, and the unleashing of a great flood of torrential groundwater freed by nuclear detonations.\nBy the end, most of the First Hundred are dead, and virtually all who remain have fled to a hidden refuge established years earlier by Ai and her followers. (One exception is Phyllis Boyle, who has allied herself with the transnats; she is on Clarke when the space elevator cable is cut and sent flying out of orbit to a fate unknown by the conclusion of the book.) The revolution dies and life on Mars returns to a sense of stability under heavy transnat control. The clash over resources on Earth breaks out into a full-blown world war leaving hundreds of millions dead, but cease-fire arrangements are reached when the transnats flee to the safety of the developed nations, which use their huge militaries to restore order, forming police-states. But a new generation of humans born on Mars holds the promise of change. In the meantime, the remaining First Hundred \u2014including Russell, Clayborne, Toitovna, and Cherneshevsky\u2014 settle into life in Hiroko Ai's refuge called Zygote, hidden under the Martian south pole.\n\"Green Mars\"\u00a0\u2013 Terraforming.\n\"Green Mars\" takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has allowed plants to grow. It picks up the story 50 years after the events of \"Red Mars\" in the dawn of the 22nd century, following the lives of the remaining First Hundred and their children and grandchildren. Melting ice causes the top of the dome of Hiroko Ai's base under the south pole to collapse, forcing the survivors to escape into a (less literal) underground organization known as the Demimonde. Among the expanded group are the First Hundred's children, the Nisei, a number of whom live in Hiroko's second secret base, Gamete.\nAs unrest in the multinational control over Mars's affairs grows, various groups start to form with different aims and methods. Watching these groups evolve from Earth, the CEO of the Praxis Corporation sends a representative, Arthur Randolph, to organize the resistance movements. This culminates into the Dorsa Brevia agreement, in which nearly all the underground factions take part. Preparations are made for a second revolution beginning in the 2120s, from converting moholes to missiles silos or hidden bases, sabotaging orbital mirrors, to propelling Deimos out of Mars' gravity well and out into deep space so it could never be used as a weapons platform as Phobos was.\nThe book follows the characters across the Martian landscape, which is explained in detail. Russell's character infiltrates the transnat terraforming project, with a carefully crafted fake identity as Stephen Lindholm. The newly evolving Martian biosphere is described at great length and with more profound changes mostly aimed at warming up the surface of Mars to the brink of making it habitable, from continent-sized orbital mirrors, another space elevator built (using another anchored asteroid that is dubbed \"New Clarke\"), to melting the northern polar ice cap, and digging moholes deep enough to form volcanoes. A mainstay of the novel is a detailed analysis of philosophical, political, personal, economic, and geological experiences of the characters. The story weaves back and forth from character to character, providing a picture of Mars as seen by them.\nSax, alias Stephen, eventually becomes romantically involved with Phyllis, who had survived the events of 2061 from the end of the first novel, but she discovers his true identity and has him arrested. Members of the underground launch a daring rescue from the prison facility where Sax suffers torture and interrogation that causes him to have a stroke; Maya kills Phyllis in the process of the rescue.\nThe book ends on a major event which is a sudden catastrophic rise in Earth's global sea levels not caused primarily by any greenhouse effect but by the eruption of a chain of volcanoes underneath the ice of West Antarctica, disintegrating the ice sheet and displacing the fragments into the ocean. The resultant flooding causes global chaos on Earth, creating the perfect moment for the Martian underground to seize control of Martian society from Earth. Following a series of largely bloodless coups, an extremist faction of Reds bombs a dam near Burroughs, the major city where the remaining United Nations forces have concentrated, in order to force the security forces to evacuate. The entire city is flooded and the population of the city has to walk a staggeringly long distance in the open Martian atmosphere (which just barely has the temperature, atmospheric pressure, and gas mixture to support human life) to Libya Station, in order to resettle in other locations. With this, control of Mars is finally wrested away from Earth with minimal loss of life, leaving the weary survivors hopeful about the prospects of their newfound political autonomy.\n\"Blue Mars\"\u00a0\u2013 Long-term results.\n\"Blue Mars\" takes its title from the stage of terraforming that has allowed atmospheric pressure and temperature to increase so that liquid water can exist on the planet's surface, forming rivers and seas. It follows closely in time from the end of \"Green Mars\" and has a much wider scope than the previous two books, covering an entire century after the second revolution. As Earth is heavily flooded by the sudden melting of the Antarctic ice cap, the once mighty metanats are brought to their knees; as the Praxis Corporation paves a new way of \"democratic businesses\". Mars becomes the \"Head\" of the system, giving universal healthcare, free education, and an abundance of food. However, this sparks illegal immigration from Earth, so to ease the population strain on the Blue Planet, Martian scientists and engineers are soon put to the task of creating asteroid cities; where small planetoids of the Belt are hollowed out, given a spin to produce gravity, and a mini-sun is created to produce light and heat.\nWith a vast increase in sciences, technologies, and spacecraft manufacturing, this begins the \"Accelerando\"; where humankind spreads its civilization throughout the Solar System, and eventually beyond. As Venus, the Jovian moons, the Saturnian moons, and eventually Triton are colonized and terraformed in some way, Jackie Boone (the granddaughter of John Boone, the first man to walk on Mars from the first book) takes an interstellar vessel (made out of an asteroid) to another star system twenty light-years away, where they will start to terraform the planets and moons found there.\nThe remaining First Hundred are generally regarded as living legends. Reports of Hiroko's survival are numerous, and purported sightings occur all over the colonized solar system, but none are substantiated. Nadia and Art Randolph lead a constitutional congress in which a global system of government is established that leaves most cities and settlements generally autonomous, but subject to a central representative legislature and two systems of courts, one legal and the other environmental. The environmental court is packed with members of the Red faction as a concession (in exchange for their support in the congress, as much of their power was broken when they attempted and failed to violently expel remaining UN forces early on after the second revolution of Green Mars; yet they still retained enough power to stymie constitutional negotiations). Vlad, Marina, and Ursula, the original inventors of the longevity treatments, introduce a new economic system that is a hybrid of capitalism, socialism, and environmental conservationism. During a trip to Earth occurring alongside the congress, Nirgal (one of the original children to be born on Mars to the First Hundred, and something of a Mars-wide celebrity), Maya, and Sax negotiate an agreement that allows Earth to send a number of migrants equal to 10% of Mars' population to Mars every year. Following the adoption of the new constitution, Nadia is elected the first president of Mars and serves competently, although she does not enjoy politics. She and Art work together closely, and eventually fall in love and have a child.\nSax Russell devotes himself to various scientific projects, all the while continuing to recover from the effects of his stroke. Since the second revolution, he feels enormous guilt that his pro-terraforming position became the dominant one at the expense of the goals of Ann's anti-terraforming stance, as Sax and Ann have come to be regarded as the original champions of their respective positions. Sax becomes increasingly preoccupied with seeking forgiveness and approval from Ann, while Ann, depressed and bitter from her many political and personal losses, is suicidal and refuses to accept any more longevity treatments. However, when Sax witnesses Ann collapse into a coma during an attempt to demonstrate to her the beauty of the terraformed world, he arranges for her to be resuscitated and to be treated with the longevity treatment, both against her will.\nThe longevity treatments themselves begin to show weaknesses once those receiving them reach the two-century mark in age. The treatments reduce most aging processes to a negligible rate, but are much less effective when it comes to brain function, and in particular memory. Maya in particular suffers extreme lapses in memory, although she remains high functioning most of the time. Further, as people age, they begin to show susceptibility to strange, fatal conditions which have no apparent explanation and are resistant to any treatment. Most common is the event that comes to be known as the \"quick decline\", where a person of extremely advanced age and in apparently good health suffers a sudden fatal heart arrythmia and dies abruptly. The exact mechanism is never explained. Michel dies of the quick decline, while attending the wake of another First Hundred member. Russell speculates that Michel's quick decline was brought on by the shock of seeing Maya fail to remember Frank Chalmers (who was killed while escaping security forces in the first revolution) upon looking at a treasured photo of him on her refrigerator. As a result of this and Russell's own problems with memory, he organizes a team of scientists to develop medicine that will restore memory. The remaining members of the First Hundred, of which there are only 12, congregate in Underhill, and take the medicine. It works so well that Russell remembers his own birth. He and Ann Clayborne finally recall that they had been in love prior to leaving Earth the very first time, but both had been too socially inept and nervous about their chances for selection for the Mars voyage to reveal this to each other. Their famous argument over terraforming had been a mere continuation of a running conversation they had been having since they still lived on Earth. Through the memory treatment it is also revealed that Phyllis had been lobbying to free Sax from his torturers when she was murdered by Maya. Maya herself declines the treatment. Sax also distinctly recalls Hiroko assisting him in finding his rover in a storm before he nearly froze to death before disappearing once again and is convinced she remains alive, although the question of whether she is actually alive is never resolved.\nEventually, the anti-immigration factions of the Martian government provoke massive illegal immigration from Earth, risking another war; however, under the leadership of Ann and Sax, who have fallen in love again following their reconciliation, along with Maya, the Martian population unites to reconstitute the government to accept more immigration from Earth, diffusing the imminent conflict and ushering in a new golden age of harmony and security on Mars.\n\"The Martians\"\u00a0\u2013 Short stories.\n\"The Martians\" is a collection of short stories that takes place over the timespan of the original trilogy of novels, as well as some stories that take place in an alternate version of the novels where the First Hundred's mission was one of exploration rather than colonization. Buried in the stories are several hints about the eventual fate of the Martian terraforming program.\nStory elements.\nCorporations.\nTrans-national Corporations, nicknamed \"transnats\", are extremely powerful multinational corporations that first emerge in the mid-21st century. Robinson tracks the evolution of the transnats into what he terms \"metanats\" (metanational). These multinational corporations have grown so large as a result of globalization that they have sufficient economic power to take over or strongly manipulate national governments, initially only relatively small third-world governments, but later, larger developed governments too, effectively running whole countries. In Robinson's future history, the metanational corporations become similar to nation-states in some respects, while continually attempting to take over competitors in order to become the sole controller of the interplanetary market. As the \"Mars\" trilogy draws to a close in the mid-23rd century, the metanational corporations are forced by a global catastrophe to concede more democratic powers to their workforces.\nAlthough there are many transnational and metanational corporations mentioned, two play an active role in the development of the plotline: Praxis, a largely benevolent and relatively democratic firm, and Subarash\u012b, which plays a large role in the maltreatment of the citizens of Mars.\nGenetic engineering.\nGenetic engineering is first mentioned in \"Red Mars\"; it takes off when Sax creates an alga to withstand the harsh Martian temperature and convert its atmosphere into breathable air. Eventually this is done on a massive scale, with thousands of types of GE algae, lichen and bacteria being created to terraform the planet. In \"Green Mars\", GE animals began to be created to withstand the thin Martian atmosphere, and to produce a working planetary-biosphere. By \"Blue Mars\", GE is commonly being done on humans, willingly, to help them better adapt to the new worlds; to breathe thinner air (e.g. Russell), or to see better in the dimmer light of the outer planets.\nOther themes.\nThe books also speculate on the colonization of other planets and moons in the Solar System, and include descriptions of settlements or terraforming efforts on Callisto, Mercury, Titania, Miranda and Venus. Toward the end of the last novel, humans are taking sub-light colony ships to other stars, taking advantage of the longevity treatments to survive the trip to their destinations.\nA great portion of \"Blue Mars\" is concerned with the effects of extreme longevity on its protagonists, most of whom have lived over two hundred years as a result of repeated longevity treatments. In particular, Robinson speculates on the psychological effects of ultra-longevity, including memory loss, personality change, mental instability, and existential boredom.\nCharacters.\nThe First Hundred.\nThe initial colonists from the \"Ares\" who established a permanent colony. Many of them later become leaders or exemplary figures in the transformation of Mars or its new society. The \"First Hundred\" actually consisted of 101, with Coyote being smuggled aboard the Ares by Hiroko.\nJohn Boone.\nAn American astronaut, who was the first human to walk on Mars in the year 2020. He returns a public hero and uses his considerable influence to lobby for a second mission, this time one of colonization. Boone received a large amount of radiation on his first trip to Mars, more than the recommended dosage according to medical regulations. However, his celebrity status allows him to skirt this. On the second voyage, Boone is one of the \"First Hundred\" colonists sent to permanently colonize Mars. His accomplishments and natural charm yield him an informal leadership role. In the first chapter of \"Red Mars\", John Boone is assassinated in a plot instigated by Frank Chalmers. The narrative then steps back to the First Hundred's voyage to Mars aboard the spaceship \"Ares\". His ideas continue as a point of reference for the remainder of the trilogy. Boone's character portrayal is complex; in one light, Boone is a stereotypically simple, heroic figure, an everyman hero: his first words on his first trip to Mars are \"Well, here we are.\" He is almost uniformly cheerful and good-natured, and approaches everything he undertakes with hale bonhomie. But later in \"Red Mars\", Robinson switches to Boone's point of view, and it is in this section that it is revealed that late in life, Boone is addicted to omegendorph, a fictional drug that is based on endorphins in the human brain. In addition, it reveals that at least some of his seeming simplicity might simply be an act designed to further his political goals. Overall, Boone is presented as larger-than-life.\nFrank Chalmers.\nHead of the American contingent, he is Machiavellian in his use of power. However, his cynicism is later shown to be a form of self-defense; Chalmers is at least partly driven by a hidden idealistic side. Early in the voyage to Mars, he becomes sexually involved with Maya Toitovna, the leader of the Russian contingent of the mission. During the second half of the voyage, Toitovna becomes involved with Boone. Already bitter that Boone became the first to walk on Mars instead of him as they were both candidates for the mission and that he was allowed to join the colonization trip despite his manipulations, Chalmers further despises Boone because of Toitovna's affection. His dislike culminates in his involvement in a plot to assassinate Boone, which ultimately succeeds and allows him to take over handling major affairs on Mars. This ultimately becomes his undoing, as his ruthless governance and aggressive diplomatic work backfire on him during the revolution of 2061. In the final chapters of \"Red Mars\", Chalmers flees with Toitovna and other members of the First Hundred to join the hidden colonists at the polar ice cap but dies along the way when he is caught outside their vehicle during an aquifer flood in Valles Marineris.\nMaya Toitovna.\nAn emotional woman who is at the center of a love triangle between Boone and Chalmers, she begins as head of the Russian contingent. The novels hint that she used both wit and seduction to rise through the ranks of the Russian space agency to become the leader of the first colonization mission. After the first revolution, she flees with other members of the First Hundred to the hidden colony in the pole. She becomes a school teacher of the children of the hidden colonists but later becomes a powerful political force. After the deaths of Chalmers and Boone, she falls in love with Michel Duval. She suffers heavily from bipolar disorder and from memory-related psychological disorders with growing age, which often lead her to isolate herself from others and sometimes turn violent. Throughout the novels, Maya takes an active political role, helping to keep the surviving First Hundred together during the failed revolution of 2061 and guiding the successful revolutions that occur decades later, despite her psychological problems.\nNadezhda \"Nadia\" Chernyshevski.\nA Russian engineer who started out building nuclear reactors in Siberia, during the voyage and initial exploration of Mars, she does her best to avoid the squabbles of the other members of the First Hundred. Instead, she busies herself by building the first permanent habitation of Mars, Underhill, using programmed automated robots. She also helps to construct a new and larger habitat, and research facility in a nearby canyon. In the later books, she becomes a reluctant politician. Chernyshevski is in love with Bogdanov and is devastated when he is killed in an attack by anti-revolutionary forces associated with UNOMA, the transnationals and Phyllis Boyle during the first Martian revolution. In retaliation for Bogdanov's murder, she activates his hidden weapon system, built into Phobos, which causes the entire moon (a UNOMA/transnational military base) to decelerate in orbit and destructively aerobrake in Mars' atmosphere, utterly destroying it. In \"Blue Mars\", she falls in love with Art Randolph, with whom she eventually starts a family. After Martian independence, she grudgingly becomes the first president of Mars.\nArkady Bogdanov.\nA mechanical engineer with anarchist leanings, possibly based on the Russian Machist, Alexander Bogdanov (the character's ancestor) and Arkady Strugatsky, he is regarded by many other members of the First Hundred, particularly Boyle, as a troublemaker. He leads the team which establishes an outpost on the moon Phobos, and leads an uprising against the transnational corporation towards the end of first novel. Like Boone (with whom he was good friends), his political ideas (later known as Bogdanovism) weigh heavily on characters later in the series. In love with Nadia Chernyshevski, he is killed during the first Martian revolution in 2061.\nSaxifrage \"Sax\" Russell.\nAn American physicist, he is a brilliant and creative scientist, and is greatly respected for his intellectual gifts. However, he is socially awkward and often finds it difficult to understand and relate to other people. Russell is a leader of the Green movement, the goal of which is to terraform Mars. During \"Green Mars\", Sax suffers a stroke while being tortured by government security forces and fellow member of the First Hundred, Phyllis Boyle (although according to later it is revealed she actually opposed Sax's torture). He subsequently suffers from Expressive aphasia and has to relearn how to speak and becomes less predictable in his actions. Originally apolitical, this event and a growing attachment to Mars itself leads Russell to become the physical architect of the second revolution. After memory issues become apparent in many of the remaining first hundred including Sax he begins work on an ambitious project to gather the remaining first hundred and have them try an experimental treatment he helped to develop. It is after this that Sax realizes his persistent attempts to please Ann are actually because he is also secretly in love with Ann Clayborne, who cannot stand him at first, but after decades on Mars, eventually reconciles. Saxifrage means \"stonebreaker\" and is the name for an Alpine plant that grows between stones.\nAnn Clayborne.\nAn American geologist, Clayborne is one of the first areologists and maintains a stalwart desire to see Mars preserved in the state it holds when humans arrive. Clayborne early on debates Saxifrage Russell over the proper role of humanity on Mars and though initially apolitical, this stance marks her as the original \"Red,\" while Russell's hands-on terraforming reflects the antithesis of these views. Clayborne is shown to prefer solitude during much of the series, and even her relationship with fellow First Hundred settler Simon (with whom she has a child) is subject to introspective silence in most cases. Simon's death and the estrangement she finds from their son Peter when the latter emerges as a leading moderate \"green\" drive her to further isolation. Clayborne's relationship with Russell is shown to be complex, the two of them taking early opposite views but the situation slowly changing as Russell comes to appreciate what has been unleashed and what has indeed been lost as science gives way to commercial exploitation that he cannot control. During the events of \"Blue Mars\", Russell intervenes to save Clayborne's life; later, the two are revealed to have once shared an attraction that went astray because of a casual misinterpretation between them. Ann undergoes a drastic change towards Blue Mars due to the emergence of something inside of her that she describes as anti-Ann and something else that she can't quite describe.\nHiroko Ai.\nA Japanese expert on biology, agriculture, and ecological systems, it was Ai who smuggled Desmond \"Coyote\" Hawkins onto the \"Ares\" (the two were friends and lovers as students in London). She is the charismatic leader of the farm team, one of the important work groups and cliques among the First Hundred. She thus becomes the focus of many of the trilogy's central themes. Most importantly, she teaches the importance of maintaining a respectful relation with one's planet. On Mars, this is called the Areophany. In the secret colony Zygote, which Hiroko established, the first generation of children of the First Hundred, the ectogenes, are all the product of artificial insemination outside of any human body. Hiroko uses the ova of the female members of the First Hundred as the female genetic material and uses the sperm of the male members of the First Hundred to fertilize the ova. Although Hiroko is seldom at the center of the narrative, her influence is pervasive. She disappears for the final time in \"Green Mars\". Her ultimate fate is left unresolved.\nMichel Duval.\nA French psychologist pivotally involved in early psychological screening of First Hundred candidates in Antarctica which he describes as being a collection of double blind requirements. Duval is assigned to accompany the Mars mission and is treated as an observer rather than as a member of the team during the early events of \"Red Mars\". His aloof personality enforces this ostracism and also subverts his relationships with others, but in time it becomes clear that Duval is struggling with his own psychological issues perhaps more than anyone else from the expedition. During the first disappearance of the farm team, he is invited by Hiroko to flee with the farm team and establish Zygote, the first hidden colony. Duval desperately wants to return to Provence as he remembers it, and after visiting as a part of the Martian diplomatic mission to Earth, he becomes even more homesick. Duval falls in love with Maya Toitovna and guides her through particularly challenging psychological episodes throughout most of the series, dying late in \"Blue Mars\" of heart arrhythmia when Maya displays signs of very heavy temporary memory loss.\nVladimir \"Vlad\" Taneev.\nNearly sixty when he arrives on Mars, a Russian biological scientist who is the oldest of the First Hundred. Taneev heads medical treatment and most research projects on Mars, becoming famous as the creator of the gerontological treatment used to regenerate human cellular systems and ushering in a new era of longevity. He lives in Acheron on the Great Escarpment in the north of Mars before fleeing to the hidden colony after the First Revolution but later returns to his research, falling victim to \"quick decline\" late in the events of \"Blue Mars\". For much of his Mars-centric life, Taneev lives in a m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with Ursula and Marina, the exact nature of which is never resolved.\nPhyllis Boyle.\nA Christian American geologist with a harsh personality that does not win her many friends among the First Hundred and gains particular enmity from Ann Clayborne. As the Mars situation develops, Boyle sides against most of the First Hundred in favor of the increasingly authoritarian United Nations Office of Mars Affairs (UNOMA) and its successor, the corporate/quasi-fascist United Nations Transitional Authority (UNTA). Her influence is strongest during the later events of \"Red Mars\", where by the 2061 revolution she has been placed in charge of the asteroid Clarke that serves as the counterweight of the First Space Elevator. The events of the revolution send Clarke (and Boyle) spinning off into the outer Solar System at the end of \"Red Mars\"; \"Green Mars\" finds her back in the equation, but her influence is greatly reduced against the backdrop of a much-expanded UNTA presence. Boyle engages in a brief sexual relationship with Saxifrage Russell (who despises her) while the latter is living under an assumed identity and is singularly capable of discerning who he really is, turning him over the UNTA. She is later present at a session in Kasei Vallis where Russell is being tortured, and is killed by Maya Toitovna. Later, as his memory recovers, Russell reveals that Boyle had been opposed to his torture and was demanding that he be released at the time that Maya's team freed him.\nDesmond \"Coyote\" Hawkins.\nA Trinidadian stowaway, he is a friend and supporter of Hiroko, and a fervent anarchist communist. Present in \"Red Mars\" only as a stowaway who eventually blends effortlessly into the Martian background, he is not even identified as anything more than Coyote until the beginning of \"Green Mars\". He becomes a leading figure in the underground and an unofficial coordinator of a developing gift economy.\nTheir descendants.\nSince the trilogy covers over 200 years of human history, later immigrants and the children and grandchildren of the First Hundred eventually become important characters in their own right.\nThe Martians use the same terminology for different generations as Japanese Americans. People who immigrated from Earth are called issei, the first generation born on Mars are nisei, and the second-generation Martians are sansei. Third-generation Martians are called yonsei.\nKasei.\nKasei is the son of Hiroko and John Boone and the father of Jackie Boone. Kasei is the leader of the Kakaze, a radical Red faction. His name is Japanese for the planet Mars. He dies during the second revolution, after an unsuccessful attack on the second space elevator.\nNirgal.\nThe son of Hiroko and Coyote, he is raised communally by Hiroko and her followers in Zygote. He is a good-natured wanderer who eventually becomes a political leader advocating ties with Earth. He is one of the founders of the Free Mars movement and is famous for his running technique that allows him to run all day for days on end. As Nadia's assistants, he and Art are instrumental in getting the Martian constitutional declaration written. Later he is sent on a diplomatic mission to Earth but nearly dies from an infection. His name is ancient Babylonian for Mars (the planet and the war-god).\nJackie Boone.\nThe granddaughter of Hiroko and John Boone (raised with Nirgal), she emerges as a leader of the Free Mars movement, but is seen to change her platform based on whatever keeps her in power (e.g. changing from banning Earth immigration to allowing almost unlimited immigrants). After her daughter Zo's death, she retires in grief and joins a one-way expedition to an extrasolar planet near Aldebaran.\nPeter Clayborne.\nPeter Clayborne is the son of Ann Clayborne and Simon Frazier, being one of the first children born on Mars. Peter holds a position of older brother to all of the following first generation. Many revolutionary and later political decisions of the Mars First movement are influenced by his opinions and judgment. He works part-time as an engineer and a green politician.\nZoya \"Zo\" Boone.\nJackie's daughter; she has feline traits (purring) inserted into her genome via the gerontological longevity treatment. In \"Blue Mars\", she travels the solar system running political errands for Jackie, although the two do not get along particularly well. Her character is portrayed as hedonistic and explicitly nihilistic, making sexual satisfaction a priority and seemingly having little regard for the feelings of others. On the other hand, she apparently has a conscience, risking her life to rescue a man on Mercury and later dying in an attempt to save a distressed flier.\nNikki.\nThe daughter of Nadia and Art.\nOther characters.\nArthur \"Art\" Randolph.\nA representative of the Praxis corporation sent to contact the Martian underground movement on a quasi-diplomatic mission in an attempt to create a system of ecological capitalism based on democratic corporations. Like the other metanationals, it takes on intensive economic and political ties with governments, but Praxis aims for partnerships rather than exploitive relationships.\nZeyk Tuqan () and his wife Nazik ().\nBedouin nomads who originally emigrated from Egypt and respected figures in the Arab Martian community. Zeyk is a close friend of Chalmers. His eidetic memory becomes a minor plot point.\nWilliam Fort.\nThe founder of Praxis, one of the huge multinational corporations. He embraces a fusion of Eastern and Western lifestyles.\nDevelopment history.\nIn an interview at UCSD, Robinson said that he was looking at a satellite photo of Mars and thought that would be a great place to go backpacking. He said the Mars trilogy grew out of that urge.\nAdaptations and uses.\nScreen adaptations.\nThe series has had difficulty moving into film and TV for over two decades. The Mars trilogy screen production rights were held by James Cameron in the late 1990s, who conceived a five-hour miniseries to be directed by Martha Coolidge, but he subsequently passed on the option. Later, Gale Ann Hurd planned a similar mini-series for the Sci-Fi Channel, which also remained unproduced. Then, in October 2008, it was reported that AMC and Jonathan Hensleigh had teamed up and were planning to develop a television mini-series based on \"Red Mars\".\nIn September 2014, SpikeTV announced it was working with producer Vince Gerardis to develop a TV series adaptation of \"Red Mars\" and in December 2015, formally greenlit a ten-episode first season of a TV series based on the novels, with J. Michael Straczynski serving as showrunner and writer. However, in March 2016, \"Deadline\" reported that Straczynski had left his position as showrunner with Peter Noah replacing him, but he too left due to creative differences with Spike. Spike then put the series on hold for further development.\nOn Phoenix spacecraft.\nThe content of \"Green Mars\" and the cover artwork for \"Red Mars\" are included on the Phoenix DVD, carried on board \"Phoenix\", a NASA lander that successfully touched down on Mars in May 2008. The First Interplanetary Library is intended to be a sort of time capsule for future Mars explorers and colonists.\nTranslations to other languages.\nThe trilogy has been translated into Spanish, French, German, Russian, Chinese, Polish, Hebrew, Japanese, Italian, Romanian, Bulgarian and Serbian among others."}
{"title": "The_Brief_Wondrous_Life_of_Oscar_Wao", "label": "Book", "text": "The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao is a novel written by Dominican American author Junot D\u00edaz, published in 2007. Although a work of fiction, the novel is set in New Jersey in the United States, where D\u00edaz was raised, and it deals with the Dominican Republic experience under dictator Rafael Trujillo. The book chronicles both the life of Oscar de Le\u00f3n, an overweight Dominican boy growing up in Paterson, New Jersey, who is obsessed with science fiction and fantasy novels and with falling in love, as well as a curse that has plagued his family for generations.\nNarrated by multiple characters, the novel incorporates a significant amount of Spanglish and neologisms, as well as references to fantasy and science fiction books and films. Through its overarching theme of the \"fuk\u00fa\" curse, it additionally contains elements of magic realism. It received highly positive reviews from critics, who praised D\u00edaz's writing style and the multi-generational story. \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" went on to win numerous awards in 2008, such as the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction.\nConcept.\nThe book chronicles the life of Oscar de Le\u00f3n, an overweight Dominican boy growing up in Paterson, New Jersey, who is obsessed with science fiction and fantasy novels and with falling in love, as well as with the curse that has plagued his family for generations.\nThe middle sections of the novel center on the lives of Oscar's runaway sister, Lola; his mother, Hypatia Belicia Cabral; and his grandfather, Abelard. Rife with footnotes, science fiction and fantasy references, comic book analogies, and various Spanish dialects, the novel is also a meditation on story-telling, the Dominican diaspora and identity, sexuality, and oppression.\nMost of the story is told by an apparently omniscient narrator who is eventually revealed to be Yunior de Las Casas, a college roommate of Oscar's who dated Lola. Yunior also appears in many of D\u00edaz's short stories and is often seen as an alter ego of the author.\nPlot.\nMain narrative.\nOscar de Le\u00f3n (nicknamed Oscar Wao, a bastardization of Oscar Wilde) is an overweight Dominican growing up in Paterson, New Jersey. Oscar desperately wants to be successful with women but, from a young age, is unable to find love, largely because he is a nerd obsessed with science fiction and comic books. His great fear is that he will die a virgin.\nAfter high school, Oscar attends Rutgers University. His sister's boyfriend Yunior (the narrator of much of the novel) moves in with Oscar and tries to help him get in shape and become more \"normal\". After \"getting dissed by a girl\", he attempts to kill himself by drinking two bottles of liquor and jumping off the New Brunswick train bridge. He survives the fall but is seriously injured.\nOscar recuperates and graduates from Rutgers. He substitute teaches at his former high school and dreams about writing an epic work of science fiction. Eventually, he moves to the Dominican Republic and falls helplessly in love with Ybon, a sex worker who lives near him. Ybon is kind to Oscar but rejects his frequent romantic overtures. Ybon's boyfriend, a violent police captain, becomes jealous of Oscar and sends two goons who kidnap Oscar, take him to the sugarcane fields, and beat him into a coma. Oscar's family takes him back to the United States to heal.\nOscar recovers from the beating, borrows money from Yunior, and returns to the Dominican Republic. He spends 27 days writing and stalking Ybon. She is horrified at first but softens and eventually has sex with Oscar. Ybon's boyfriend's goons then find Oscar, take him back to the sugarcane fields, and kill him.\nFlashbacks and secondary narratives.\nThe novel contains significant exposition on Oscar's family history. One section is a first person narrative from the perspective of Oscar's sister, Lola, explaining her struggles to get along with their headstrong mother, Beli. Subsequent sections detail Beli's backstory growing up as an orphan in the Dominican Republic after her father was imprisoned and her mother and two sisters died. Her father was imprisoned after failing to bring his wife and daughter to meet some government officials, as he fears they will be taken by them. After being raised by an aunt, Beli enters into a relationship with a Gangster named Dionisio.\nStyle.\nNarration.\nInstead of D\u00edaz directly telling the story to the reader, he creates an aesthetic distance by speaking through the novel's narrator Yunior. Yunior provides analysis and commentary for the events he is relaying in the novel. His speech often exemplifies code switching, switching rapidly from a lively, Caribbean-inflected vernacular, replete with frequent usage of profanity to wordy, eloquent, and academic prose. This runs in parallel to several central themes of the novel regarding identity, as Yunior's code switching alludes to a struggle between his Dominican identity and his identity as a writer. Code switching between Spanish and English is also central to the narrative itself of the book, as characters switch back and forth as they see fit.\nThe narration of the book also shifts away from Yunior to another character at several key moments in the story. In chapter two, Lola narrates her own story from the first person. This is foreshadowing of the intimacy between Lola and Yunior yet to come. The beginning of chapter two also features the use of second person narration, rarely used in literature.\nD\u00edaz's use of Yunior as the main narrator of the book strengthens the idea of the novel as metafiction. Yunior reminds the reader consistently that he is telling the story, as opposed to the story happening in its own right.\nFootnotes.\n\"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" makes extensive use of footnotes to the point that many of the characters are developed in the footnotes in addition to the story. Rather than just provide factual background, Yunior's narrative continues in the footnotes just as it does in the body of the novel. When describing Oscar's deep love of science fiction and fantasy literature, Yunior continues in the footnotes: \"Where this outsized love of genre jumped off from no one quite seems to know. It might have been a consequence being Antillean (who more sci-fi than us?)\u00a0...\" The presence of Yunior's footnotes, therefore, remind the reader that there is always more to one's story.\nYunior even makes reference in the footnotes to his present life earlier in the novel than when he describes it in Chapter Eight. \"In my first draft, Saman\u00e1 was actually Jarabacoa, but then my girl Leonie, resident expert in all things Domo, pointed out that there are no beaches in Jarabacoa.\" Yunior thus builds the writing of the novel and his relationship with Oscar into the greater history of the Dominican Republic. The many science fiction references throughout the novel and footnotes emphasize (Yunior believes) the fantastical elements of Dominican history. Yunior cites the fall of Mordor and the dispelling of evil from Middle Earth from \"The Lord of the Rings\" as a complement to the fall of Trujillo.\nThe footnotes contain many references specifically to the reign of Rafael Trujillo from 1930 to 1961, providing historical background on figures like the Mirabal Sisters, who were assassinated by Trujillo, and Anacaona, an indigenous woman who fought against the invading Spanish colonialists. While referencing historical figures, Yunior frequently includes the novel's fictional characters in the historical events.\n\"But what was even more ironic was that Abelard had a reputation for being able to keep his head down during the worst of the regime's madness\u2014for unseeing, as it were. In 1937, for example, while the Friends of the Dominican Republic were perejiling Haitians and Haitian-Dominicans and Haitian-looking Dominicans to death, while genocide was, in fact, in the making, Abelard kept his head, eyes, and nose safely tucked into his books (let his wife take care of hiding his servants, didn't ask her nothing about it) and when survivors staggered into his surgery with unspeakable machete wounds, he fixed them up as best he could without making any comments as to the ghastliness of their wounds.\"\nYunior thus builds a context for the Dominican history, where the characters are used just as much in the footnotes as they are in the body of the novel.\nMany of the footnotes ultimately connect back to themes of coming to a new world (underscored through the novel's references to fantasy and sci-fi) or having one's own world completely changed. Trujillo's reign as revealed in the footnotes of the novel becomes just as dystopian as one of Oscar's favorite science fiction novels.\nSlang.\nD\u00edaz moves between several styles in the novel as the narrative shifts to each of the characters. Oscar's speech reflects an autodidactic language based on his knowledge of fantasy, 'nerd' literature and his speech is filled with phrases such as \"I think she's orchidaceous\" and \"I do not move so precipitously\", whereas Yunior \"affects a bilingual b-boy flow\" and intersperses it with literary language. The story of the De L\u00e9on family is told and collected by the fictional narrator Yunior and the \"New York Times\" critic Michiko Kakutani has described the voice of the book as \"a streetwise brand of Spanglish\". He often gives his own commentary and analysis on the events he is relating in the story and sometimes reveals failings in his own life, both as a narrator and a person: \"Players: never never never fuck with a bitch named Awilda. Because when she awildas out on your ass you'll know pain for real.\"\nHis informal and frequent use of neologisms can be seen in sentences such as a description of Trujillo as \"the Dictatingest Dictator who ever Dictated\" or his description of the effectiveness of Trujillo's secret police force: \"you could say a bad thing about El Jefe at eight-forty in the morning and before the clock struck ten you'd be in the Cuarenta having a cattleprod shoved up your ass.\"\n\"Oscar Wao\" also oscillates between English and Spanish. Yunior peppers the English-speaking novel with Spanish vocabulary and phrases and certain English sentences are built with Spanish syntax: \"Beli might have been a puta major in the cosmology of her neighbors but a cuero she was not.\"\nOscar lives his life surrounded by the culture of fantasy and as Oscar describes them, \"the more speculative genres\", and the language of these cultures is strewn throughout the book along with Spanish. Brief phrases relating to games like Dungeons &amp; Dragons and tabletop role-playing game terms are used as common colloquialisms: \"He [Oscar] could have refused, could have made a saving throw against Torture, but instead he went with the flow.\"\nMagical realism.\nThe Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao contains several of the hallmarks of Latin American Magical Realism. The novel's plot is intricately bound up with the notion of Fuk\u00fa Americanus, which is \"generally a curse of doom of some kind; specifically, the Curse or Doom of the New World\". The reliance on Fuk\u00fa, and its counterpart Zafa gives the novel a fantastical element which show magical realisms part in the plot, as the narrative follows the impact of the supernatural curse. This is coupled with other supernatural elements such as the man with no face and the mongoose.\nThe fantastical elements of the novel take place in both New Jersey and in the Dominican Republic. This combination establishes a real world setting for these events which blends the natural with the supernatural, another attribute of Magical Realism.\nIn addition of the fantastical elements of the novel, Oscar Wao also includes a degree of political critique, in the discussion of the Trujillo dictatorship of the Dominican Republic, as well as a portrayal of metafiction, in Oscar's own writing on fantasy novels. Both political critique and metafiction are typical features of Magical Realism.\nD\u00edaz also hints at the novels Magical Realist elements by claiming that F\u00faku was popular in places like Macondo, which is the fictional setting for One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, which is seen as one of the most prominent Latin American Magical Realist novels.\nSpeculative fiction.\nThe Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao can be used as an example of speculative fiction. \"Speculative fiction\" is a sub-category of fiction that deals with ideas that are not directly real, but rather imaginative or futuristic. The plot of this novel skips from past to present and focuses on different characters' stories at various times to convey the long-lasting impression that Rafael Trujillo's dictatorship in the Dominican Republic from 1930 to 1961 left. To emphasize the brutality of the past, the novel blends aspects of sci-fi and fantasy with horror as well as popular culture. By combining all of these elements, Diaz creates a work of speculative fiction that holds various social critiques.\nUsing Trujillo as a minor character.\nThe novel uses history to set the scene and create its social and political commentary. The basis of all of the problems that arise in this novel is the US-sponsored dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo that lasted for over thirty years. Junot Diaz surely includes Trujillo as a character in the story, but limits his representation to descriptions that come from Yunior's perspective. Because of this, Trujillo has an important role in the story, but is ultimately weakened due to the given perspective. Diaz creates irony using this strong dictator as a minor character and focusing on the characters that would have otherwise been marginalized. This arrangement destabilizes established power hierarchies, putting more emphasis on the seemingly least powerful characters and taking power away from the most prominent and infamous characters.\nFurthermore, when Trujillo is referenced by Yunior in his narration, the descriptions are entirely negative. Yunior's references show little respect and are meant to belittle Trujillo's presence in the story. By actively disparaging the brutal dictator, Diaz breaks social and cultural norms about how common people function in a power hierarchy. Yunior is given the power to represent Trujillo which lessens Trujillos dominance in the power scale, allowing the novel to have a strong stance against the dictatorship, stripping Trujillo of the meaning behind his title. Overall, making Trujillo the minor character allows Trujillo to be seen as more of a joke than a strong leader while also enforcing the seriousness and long-lasting effects of his power.\nLola's Daughter.\nThroughout the novel, Diaz uses metaphors and symbols to present Dominican history as well as the fuku curse. Lola is Oscar's older sister, and her daughter serves as a symbol of the potential to break the fuku curse. Lola's daughter is a character that holds the future for the De Leon family and symbolically the entire Dominican culture. She symbolizes the Dominican identity struggle of growing up with two cultural ties, that of the Dominican Republic and that of the United States. Although in the story her character does not know her own role, she must accept and embrace her Dominican culture to break the curse. This sense of uncertainty towards this fantastical curse allows the novel to speculate as to how it can be broken. The curse itself is meant to be a defining factor of Dominican culture. Diaz ties in Lola's daughters character with breaking the curse to show that the future of Dominican culture is to be defined by aspects others that a history of oppression and colonization. The idea that an individual has the power the change the effects of the curse in their own life is a way for the novel to show that Dominican culture can be changed in a way that marginalized people can have power.\nYunior as the narrator.\nAlthough Yunior is the narrator of the story, and everything that is said comes from his perspective, the story revolves around the unlikely hero, Oscar. Oscar is a shy, overweight teenager who loves to read and write science fiction and fantasy and is searching for love. He is constantly deemed not masculine enough by those around him, and he does not follow the norms of his Dominican culture. He too is affected by the fuku curse that stems from a long history of oppression, and the only way for him to break free is to acknowledge his own culture while also adapting to his new surroundings in the United States. Oscar's character's love for science fiction allows Diaz to intertwine metaphors from the science fiction realm such as that of \"Watchmen\". This reference allows Diaz to propose the question of whether or not it is just to 'save humanity' by killing a human and make parallels to Oscar's decision running away with Ybon as well as the future of Dominican culture and history. By referencing \"nothing ever ends\" on page 331 in the novel, Diaz proposes that the past cannot be changed, but must ultimately be accepted to create a better future and reclaim the culture.\nOscar's story is not the only one that Yunior tells. Yunior covers multiple generations of the De Leon family history to emphasize the transgenerational struggles and the inheritance of the fuku curse. Because of the way that the story is narrated, the readers get a comprehensive view of the cultural factors that surround Oscar that ultimately lead to his tragic death. Diaz shows that the mistakes made in Oscar's family lead to Oscar's fate, providing a cautionary tale for the future of Dominican culture in a fantastical context. Furthermore, Yunior recounts the stories and history of a family that is not his own. He is invested with the telling of their story, but is simultaneously reserved. He even admits that as the one telling the story, he holds a certain amount of power. By reconstructing the De Leon family story, and not letting the characters speak for themselves, Yunior subconsciously follows the 'Trujillan model of narration', suppressing their own stories for his own mental gain whether it be a recreated connection to Lola, his ex-girlfriend or Oscar, his friend.\nEven when talking about Oscar, Yunior does not focus on the fact that he is nerdy and does not hide it, but rather makes allusions to science fiction and fantasy works that Oscar would be familiar with. Yunior also shows that he and Oscar were not so different after all, but the difference was in the fact that Oscar was not able to hide the fact that he was an outcast while Yunior was able to fit in while keeping his unique qualities and interests to himself.\nThemes and motifs.\nThe mongoose.\nMongooses appear throughout \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" as guardians of the family. Historically, the mongoose was imported from Asia during the 18th century. Mongooses were imported to tropical islands such as the Dominican Republic, Jamaica, and Hawaii. Used to protect sugar cane fields from rat infestations, mongooses were pivotal in the DR's growing sugar economy. While the mongoose is transplanted from Asia, it retroactively becomes a \"norm\" within the DR's plantation system. While the mongoose guides Beli, its presence is necessary for sugar production. The mongoose is known for its sociability and cunning. Like the de Leon family, the mongoose is an immigrant, an invasive, non-native species. The mongoose was transplanted westward to the Dominican Republic, just as Oscar's family was forced out of the Dominican Republic. D\u00edaz has stated the importance of the mongoose as being alien, creating an other-worldly quality to its assistance. Furthermore, in a footnote, the mongoose is described as \"an enemy of kingly charriots, chains, and hierarchies... an ally of Man\", suggesting the mongoose's importance in helping the de Leon family not just for their misfortune but also as a means of undermining Trujillo's oppression.\nAt the most superficial level, the mongoose can be equated with the zafa, the counter-spell to the family's fuk\u00fa. For example, when Beli is beaten in the canefield, a \"creature that would have been an amiable mongoose if not for its golden lion eyes and the absolute black of its pelt\" motivates Beli and sings to her to guide her out of the canefield. The creature acts as her protector, saving her after the atrocities just committed against her. The mongoose further stops a bus directly in front of her, preventing her from being hit and providing her transportation to safety. Similarly, Oscar remembers a \"Golden Mongoose\" which appeared just before he throws himself from the bridge and again when he is beaten in the canefield for the first time. In the canefield, the mongoose talks to Oscar and saves him just as Beli was saved. Furthermore, just as the singing mongoose leads Beli to safety, a singing voice leads Clives to Oscar.\nThis symbolic relationship is heightened by the transient nature of the mongoose, disappearing as suddenly as it appears. Each time the mysterious animal appears in a time of dire need, the narrator includes a disclaimer on the accuracy in the visions of the creature. In the case of Beli in the cane fields, the narrator shares that whether her encounter with the mongoose \"was a figment of Beli's wracked imagination or something else altogether\" cannot be determined (149). Whether or not this creature is a figment of the young woman's imagination, it led her to safety and provided hope in a situation where death seemed imminent. In having this character take on such a surreal nature with characteristics not found in most mongooses, such as the ability to talk and vanishing in the blink of an eye, D\u00edaz establishes an uncertainty that mirrors the controversies over whether superstitions exist. While the encounters with the creature may or may not have happened, their significance in the book still holds strong just like the superstitions, because \"no matter what you believe, the fuk\u00fa believes in you\" (5). The connection between a superstition and a magical character is more easily followed than one with an ordinary animal, highlighting the mongoose being a zafa against the de Leon's fuk\u00fa.\nCanefields.\nThe re/appearances of canefields in Oscar Wao are symbolic. The scenes of physical violence against Beli and Oscar are set in this specific, geographical space of the sugar canefields. Sugar was introduced to the Dominican Republic and Haiti, then Hispaniola, through colonialism. Sugar and canefields were so important to the Spanish as they fueled their wealth and the creation of a white elite, and thus plantation economy, in Hispaniola.\nThey first appear when Beli is kidnapped and taken to be beaten in a canefield. Here, the canefields are surrounded by the context of the Trujillato. After (unknowingly) becoming involved with Trujillo's sister's husband, The Gangster's men assault Beli there. The canefields are thus a violent space where Trujillo's henchpeople also take care of business. As written in footnotes, the Mirabal sisters were murdered there, too. In this section of the book Yunior says, \"Canefields are no fucking joke, and even the cleverest of adults can get mazed in their endlessness, only to reappear months later as a cameo of bones\". Much later, after Oscar returns home to La Inca's to try to be with Yb\u00f3n, he also ends up assaulted in a canefield, but this time by the Capitan's friends. A lot of the emotions and the atmosphere laid out in Oscar's canefield scene parallels Beli's.\nThe canefields in the Dominican Republic are a space made significant through their history of slavery and violence\u2014a racialized space. Canefields are where enslaved Africans were forced into labor and dehumanization. These Beli and Oscar canefield scenes are haunted by the displacement and violence against enslaved Africans, the displacement and genocide of indigenous folks, and also the revolts and resistance to these systems.\nPower of appearance.\nBeli understood how advantageous appearance is in the social situations of the Dominican Republic, but not until she had undergone major physical and psychological changes. Beli desired the same romantic experience as Oscar, despising school in her early years from being \"completely alone\" (83). Her loneliness derived from her \"defensive and aggressive and mad overactive\" personality that pushed people miles away from her. Unlike Oscar, however, her predicament reversed, becoming not one of a lack of power, but an abundance. She had to choose whether or not to take advantage of her new curvaceous body which puberty had generously bestowed upon her. With these new curves she was thrown into a world where she could get what she wanted, where she was given attention without having to ask for it. Her model-like body presented her with the relationships that she could have never attained otherwise. After recovering from her initial shock of the metamorphosis, she discovered how \"her desirability was in its own way, Power\" (94). She had been presented with a magical sceptre that allowed her to satisfy her desires. Asking her not to abuse that power was akin to, as D\u00edaz says it \"asking the persecuted fat kid not to use his recently discovered mutant abilities\" (94). By using her appearance, she gained a complete understanding of the influences of her body.\nThe power of appearance in the era of Trujillo can not be underestimated, as seen by its dangerous consequences in the de Le\u00f3n family history. Abelard Luis Cabral, Oscar's grandfather, learned this first hand after repeatedly refusing to bring his first-born daughter Jacquelyn to Trujillo's events. Trujillo's rapacity towards women knew no bounds, employing \"hundreds of spies whose entire job was to scour the provinces for his next piece of ass\" (217). Trujillo's appetite for ass was \"insatiable\" (217), pushing him to do unspeakable things. His culture of placing appearance above all else does nothing to deemphasize appearance in Dominican culture, seeing as in a normal political atmosphere people follow their leaders, much less in the tightly controlled Trujillan dictatorship. Abelard, by withholding his daughter's \"off-the-hook looks\" (216) from Trujillo, he was in effect committing \"treason\" (217). His actions eventually resulted in Trujillo arranging for his arrest and eighteen-year sentence, where he was brutally beaten and treated to an endless series of electric shock treatments (237). During his imprisonment, Socorro committed suicide, Jackie \"was found drowned\" in a pool, Astrid is struck by a stray bullet, and his third child is born (248\u2013250). Abelard and Socorro's third child, a daughter they name Belicia, was born \"black\", a terrible thing for the Dominicans, who viewed having a child of \"black complexion as an ill omen\" (248). They felt so strongly about this that Yunior, offering his own opinion, comments \"I doubt anybody inside the family wanted her to live, either\" (252). She eventually was tossed around the extended family and eventually \"sold\", yes \"That's right-she was sold\" (253). All of these tragedies as a result of the desire for a beautiful young lady, a by product of the preeminence given to physical appearance.\nEven under Trujillo, however, the power of appearance is called into the question, as appearance's power ultimately takes second place to the power of words. Cabral is incarcerated, tortured and almost destroyed at least in part as a result of words he has spoken and written, and Trujillo has Cabral's entire library, including any sample of his handwriting, destroyed. As Trujillo never attempts to sleep with Jackie, the narrator and reader are left to wonder if at some level the motivation for this family ruin has to do with silencing a powerful voice.\nReexamining masculinity through Yunior and Oscar.\nYunior and Oscar are character foils that illustrate two different types of masculinity: if Oscar's nerdiness, fatness and awkwardness make him the antithesis of Dominican hypermasculinity, then Yunior, as a Don Juan and a state school player who can \"bench 340 pounds\" (170), is the embodiment of that identity. They also have completely opposite values: while Yunior cheats habitually and can't appreciate even the most beautiful and loving women, Oscar is faithful and sees beauty in a middle-aged prostitute; while Yunior doesn't value sex for anything other than physical pleasure (at least not at first), Oscar refuses to go to brothels (279). Yunior's masculinity echoes that of Trujillo, who in his violent actions and lust for women, also embodies Dominican hypermasculinity.\nDespite their differences, Yunior and Oscar become important to each other and develop an unusual friendship. As Oscar has no father or brothers, Yunior is the only male with whom he can discuss his romantic yearnings; Yunior is his access into masculinity. As for Yunior, Oscar models an alternative form of masculinity and ultimately pushes him to reexamine his ideas about manhood. VanBeest points out that in spite Oscar's lack of machismo, he possesses \"other masculine traits that Yunior admires.\" For example, Yunior envies the way Oscar can develop friendships with women (like Jenni) and talk to them about non-sexual topics. He also respects Oscar's writing style and his ability to \"write dialogue, crack snappy exposition, keep the narrative moving\" (173). Finally, although Oscar dies in the end, Yunior admires how he was able to achieve real intimacy with a girl by being loving, faithful and vulnerable. VanBeest argues that Oscar \"succeeds in educating Yunior, indirectly, in the responsibilities of manhood; after Oscar's death, Yunior claims that it is Oscar's influence that encourages him to stop following the dictates of el machismo and finally settle down and get married.\" At the end of the novel, Yunior manages to develop a healthier form of masculinity that allows him to love others and to achieve intimacy.\nThrough Yunior and Oscar's friendship, D\u00edaz critically examines Dominican machismo and shows how it can lead to violence and an inability to connect with others. Through the figure of Oscar, he explores alternatives to hypermasculinity. If \"fuk\u00fa\" is \"[the] manifestation of the masculine ideals imposed on the Dominican Republic herself,\" then is Oscar the zafa of this fuk\u00fa.\nFilling the blank pages \u2013 stories as \"zafa\" for the fuk\u00fa of violence.\nThroughout the novel, violence is transmitted from the system of colonialism and dictators to the domestic sphere and perpetuated through the generations. Virtually all the relationships in the book \u2013 Trujillo and Abelard, Beli and the Gangster, Beli and Lola, Oscar and Yb\u00f3n \u2013 are marked with physical or emotional abuse. Violence is an aspect of the \"fuk\u00fa\" or curse that haunts the Cabrals and de Leons.\nAt the very beginning of the novel, it is explained that zafa is the \"one way to prevent disaster from coiling around you, only one surefire counterspell that would keep you and your family safe\" (7). In this way, zafa can be read as an undoing of colonialism because as fuku brings misery and bad luck, zafa has the potential to foil it and restore a more favorable balance.\nAlthough by the end none of the characters seem to have escaped the cycle of violence or the effects of fuk\u00fa, Yunior has a dream in which Oscar waves a blank book at him, and he realizes that this can be a \"zafa\" (325) to the family curse. Yunior also has hope that Isis, Lola's daughter, will one day come to him asking for stories about her family history, and \"if she's smart and as brave as I'm expecting she'll be, she'll take all we've done and all we've learned and add her own insights and she'll put an end to it [the fuk\u00fa]\" (331). Thus, the empty pages in Yunior's dreams signify that the future has yet to be written despite the checkered past, in both his life and in the painful history of oppression and colonialism in the Dominican Republic. On the other hand, Isis potentially coming to Yunior to learn more about her uncle represents gaining an understanding of the past, which is key to decolonizing and pinpointing the structures that are systematically oppressive. Yunior implies that storytelling is a way to acknowledge the past and its influence over one's life, a way to make sense of what has happened, and is the starting point for healing.\nWith the absence of any embodiments of white characters to emphasize the lasting impact of the colonial imaginary, the mysticism behind the fuku and zafa become that much more convincing. When interpreted as magic instead of as the literal actions of white people, the fuku and zafa transcend human beings and remind us that even when colonialism is not particularly obvious, it is a force that looms over all, and its effects must first be confronted before anyone can take action accordingly, as Yunior's dream suggests.\nIn an interview with Edwidge Danticat, Junot D\u00edaz comments:\n\"For me, though, the real issue in the book is not whether or not one can vanquish the fuk\u00fa\u2014but whether or not one can even see it. Acknowledge its existence at a collective level. To be a true witness to who we are as a people and to what has happened to us. That is the essential challenge for the Caribbean nations\u2014who, as you pointed out, have been annihilated by history and yet who've managed to put themselves together in an amazing way. That's why I thought the book was somewhat hopeful at the end.\"\nLiterary allusions.\nComic books, science-fiction, and fantasy literature all play an important role in Oscar's upbringing and identity, and each is incorporated into the novel to reflect the world he lives in. D\u00edaz has said that to dismiss the novel's reflexivity with fiction and fantasy is to do to the novel \"exactly what Oscar suffered from, which is that...Oscar's interests, his views of the world, were dismissed as illegitimate, as unimportant, as make-believe\", and that the novel asks the reader \"to take not only Oscar seriously but his interests seriously.\"\nComic books.\nThe novel opens with the epigraph: \"Of what import are brief, nameless lives\u2026to Galactus?\" D\u00edaz has said that this question can be read as being directed at the reader, \"because in some ways, depending on how you answer that question, it really decides whether you're Galactus or not.\" In the Fantastic Four comic book however, Galactus is asking the question of Uatu the Watcher, whose role is played out in D\u00edaz's novel by the narrator Yunior, indicating to D\u00edaz that the question is both a \"question to the reader but also a question to writers in general.\"\nEarly in the novel, D\u00edaz aligns Oscar with comic book superheroes: \"You want to know what being an X-man feels like? Just be a smart bookish boy of color in a contemporary U.S. ghetto...Like having bat wings or a pair of tentacles growing out of your chest.\" D\u00edaz hints at possible latent abilities or qualities Oscar may possess that will reveal themselves or develop later in the novel.\nThe novel describes the history of relationships between dictators and journalists in terms of comic book rivalries as well: \"Since before the infamous Caesar-Ovid war they've [dictators and writers] had beef. Like the Fantastic Four and Galactus, like the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, like the Teen Titans and Deathstroke\"\nThere is also a strong suggestion that the fantastical element of Oscar's life is a powerful method for him to relate to other people and to the world around him. When he examines his own body in the mirror he feels \"straight out of a Daniel Clowes book. Or like the fat blackish kid in Beto Hern\u00e1ndez's Palomar.\" Oscar's vast memory of comic books and Fantasy/Science-fiction is recalled whenever he is involved in the text, and his identity is multiform, composed of scraps of comic book marginalia.\nD\u00edaz creates a distinct link between human beings' performative nature and the masks required to express it, and the masks worn by superheroes. When Oscar meets Ana, one of the many women with whom he falls in love, he notices different aspects of her life and \"there was something in the seamlessness with which she switched between these aspects that convinced him that both were masks\". D\u00edaz connects the removal of masks with both the intimacy that springs from vulnerability and the concept of identity, hidden or otherwise. Oscar's infinite capacity for empathy and connection with other human beings is a superpower in its own right. Contemporary masculinity and contemporary power structures leave no room for vulnerability, but for D\u00edaz, \"the only way to encounter a human is by being vulnerable.\" The \"man with no face\" who reoccurs in several parts of the novel can also be read as a sort of mask embodying the fuk\u00fa.\nFantasy and science-fiction.\nD\u00edaz frequently uses references to works of science-fiction and fantasy. These references serve both to illuminate the world that Oscar lives in and create a parallel between the supernatural events in fantasy literature and the history of the Dominican Republic. In the opening pages of the novel, the narrator quotes Oscar as having said \"What more sci-fi than Santo Domingo? What more fantasy than the Antilles?\" One of D\u00edaz's frequent references to J. R. R. Tolkien comes when he describes Trujillo: \"Homeboy dominated Santo Domingo like it was his very own private Mordor.\" In another section, Felix Wenceslao Bernardino, an agent of Trujillo is metaphorically described as the Witchking of Angmar.\nNear the end of the book Di\u00e1z comprehensively links the fantasy world of Middle-Earth with the world of the Dominican Republic and the novel.\nTwice in the novel the mantra \"Fear is the mindkiller\" is repeated. The phrase originated in the Frank Herbert novel \"Dune\" and Oscar uses it to try and quell his own fear near the end of the story, to no avail.\nAlso, D\u00edaz references Stephen King on a number of occasions, including a reference to Captain Trips, the fictional virus that wipes out mankind in The Stand, as well as two references to its characters, Harold Lauder, compared to Oscar, and to Mother Abigail, compared to La Inca. Likewise, there is a mention of being \"flung into the macroverse\" by \"the ritual of Chud\", a nod to the ending of It.\nCritical reception.\n\"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" was widely praised and appeared in a number of \"best of the year\" book lists. The book won the John Sargent, Sr. First Novel Prize, the Dayton Peace Prize in Fiction, the National Book Critics Circle Award, and the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 2008. \"New York\" magazine named it the Best Novel of the Year and \"Time\" magazine's Lev Grossman named it the best work of fiction published in 2007, praising it as \"a massive, heaving, sparking tragicomedy\". In a poll of American literary critics organised by BBC Culture (the arts and culture section of the international BBC website) in 2015, \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" was voted the twenty-first century's best novel so far.\nIn a 2009 poll by \"The Millions\" a panel of writers, critics, and editors voted \"The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao\" the eighth-best novel since 2000, and readers ranked it in first place.\nAdaptations.\nA staged version of the novel, called Fuk\u00fa Americanus, was adapted by Sean San Jose and co-directed by San Jose and Marc Bamuthi Joseph through San Jose's Campo Santo theatre company in 2009. The production received mixed reviews, with critic Robert Hurwitt stating that \"'Fuk\u00fa' doesn't show us how that works or what the curse has to do with anything\u00a0... for that, you have to read the book.\"\nIn 2019, Repertorio Espa\u00f1ol produced \"La Breve y Maravillosa Vida de Oscar Wao\", a Spanish-language adaptation of the novel at Gramercy Arts Theatre in New York.\nFilm.\nThe novel's film rights were optioned by Miramax Films and producer Scott Rudin in 2007. Director Walter Salles and writer Jose Rivera (\"The Motorcycle Diaries\") were hired by Rudin to adapt the novel. According to D\u00edaz, Miramax's rights on the book have since expired."}
{"title": "War_and_Peace", "label": "Book", "text": "War and Peace (; pre-reform Russian: ; ) is a literary work mixed with chapters on history and philosophy by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy, first published serially, then published in its entirety in 1869. It is regarded as one of Tolstoy's finest literary achievements and remains an internationally praised classic of world literature.\nThe novel chronicles the French invasion of Russia and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled \"The Year 1805\", were serialized in \"The Russian Messenger\" from 1865 to 1867 before the novel was published in its entirety in 1869.\nTolstoy said \"War and Peace\" is \"not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle.\" Large sections, especially the later chapters, are philosophical discussions rather than narrative. The writer rewrote the novel several times. Tolstoy also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call \"War and Peace\" a novel. Instead, he regarded \"Anna Karenina\" as his first true novel.\nComposition history.\nTolstoy began writing \"War and Peace\" in 1863, the year that he finally married and settled down at his country estate. In September of that year, he wrote to Elizabeth Bers, his sister-in-law, asking if she could find any chronicles, diaries or records that related to the Napoleonic period in Russia. He was dismayed to find that few written records covered the domestic aspects of Russian life at that time, and tried to rectify these omissions in his early drafts of the novel. The first half of the book was written and named \"1805\". During the writing of the second half, he read widely and acknowledged Schopenhauer as one of his main inspirations. Tolstoy wrote in a letter to Afanasy Fet that what he had written in \"War and Peace\" is also said by Schopenhauer in \"The World as Will and Representation\". However, Tolstoy approaches \"it from the other side.\"\nThe first draft of the novel was completed in 1863. In 1865, the periodical (\"The Russian Messenger\") published the first part of this draft under the title \"1805\" and published more the following year. Tolstoy was dissatisfied with this version, although he allowed several parts of it to be published with a different ending in 1867. He heavily rewrote the entire novel between 1866 and 1869. Tolstoy's wife, Sophia Tolstaya, copied as many as seven separate complete manuscripts before Tolstoy considered it ready for publication. The version that was published in had a very different ending from the version eventually published under the title \"War and Peace\" in 1869. Russians who had read the serialized version were eager to buy the complete novel, and it sold out almost immediately. The novel was immediately translated after publication into many other languages.\nIt is unknown why Tolstoy changed the name to \"War and Peace\". He may have borrowed the title from the 1861 work of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: (\"War and Peace\" in French). The title may also be another reference to Titus, described as being a master of \"war and peace\" in \"The Twelve Caesars\", written by Suetonius in 119.\nThe completed novel was then called ( in new-style orthography; in English \"War and Peace\").\nThe \"1805\" manuscript was re-edited and annotated in Russia in 1893 and has been since translated into English, German, French, Spanish, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Albanian, Korean, and Czech.\nTolstoy was instrumental in bringing a new kind of consciousness to the novel. His narrative structure is noted not only for its god's eye point of view over and within events, but also in the way it swiftly and seamlessly portrayed an individual character's view point. His use of visual detail is often comparable to cinema, using literary techniques that resemble panning, wide shots and close-ups. These devices, while not exclusive to Tolstoy, are part of the new style of the novel that arose in the mid-19th century and of which Tolstoy proved himself a master.\nThe standard Russian text of \"War and Peace\" is divided into four books (comprising fifteen parts) and an epilogue in two parts. Roughly the first half is concerned strictly with the fictional characters, whereas the latter parts, as well as the second part of the epilogue, increasingly consist of essays about the nature of war, power, history, and historiography. Tolstoy interspersed these essays into the story in a way that defies previous fictional convention. Certain abridged versions remove these essays entirely, while others, published even during Tolstoy's life, simply moved these essays into an appendix.\nRealism.\nThe novel is set 60 years before Tolstoy's day, but he had spoken with people who lived through the 1812 French invasion of Russia. He read all the standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars and had read letters, journals, autobiographies and biographies of Napoleon and other key players of that era. There are approximately 160 real persons named or referred to in \"War and Peace\".\nHe worked from primary source materials (interviews and other documents), as well as from history books, philosophy texts and other historical novels. Tolstoy also used a great deal of his own experience in the Crimean War to bring vivid detail and first-hand accounts of how the Imperial Russian Army was structured.\nTolstoy was critical of standard history, especially military history, in \"War and Peace\". He explains at the start of the novel's third volume his own views on how history ought to be written.\nLanguage.\nAlthough the book is mainly in Russian, significant portions of dialogue are in French. It has been suggested that the use of French is a deliberate literary device, to portray artifice while Russian emerges as a language of sincerity, honesty, and seriousness. It could, however, also simply represent another element of the realistic style in which the book is written, since French was the common language of the Russian aristocracy, and more generally the aristocracies of continental Europe, at the time. In fact, the Russian nobility often knew only enough Russian to command their servants; Tolstoy illustrates this by showing that Julie Karagina, a character in the novel, is so unfamiliar with her country's native language that she has to take Russian lessons.\nThe use of French diminishes as the book progresses. It is suggested that this is to demonstrate Russia freeing itself from foreign cultural domination, and to show that a once-friendly nation has turned into an enemy. By midway through the book, several of the Russian aristocracy are eager to find Russian tutors for themselves.\nBackground and historical context.\nThe novel spans the period from 1805 to 1820. The era of Catherine the Great was still fresh in the minds of older people. Catherine had made French the language of her royal court. For the next 100 years, it became a social requirement for the Russian nobility to speak French and understand French culture.\nThe historical context of the novel begins with the execution of Louis Antoine, Duke of Enghien in 1805, while Russia is ruled by Alexander I during the Napoleonic Wars. Key historical events woven into the novel include the Ulm Campaign, the Battle of Austerlitz, the Treaties of Tilsit, and the Congress of Erfurt. Tolstoy also references the Great Comet of 1811 just before the French invasion of Russia.\nTolstoy then uses the Battle of Ostrovno and the Battle of Shevardino Redoubt in his novel, before the occupation of Moscow and the subsequent fire. The novel continues with the Battle of Tarutino, the Battle of Maloyaroslavets, the Battle of Vyazma, and the Battle of Krasnoi. The final battle cited is the Battle of Berezina, after which the characters move on with rebuilding Moscow and their lives.\nPrincipal characters.\nThe novel tells the story of five families\u2014the Bezukhovs, the Bolkonskys, the Rostovs, the Kuragins, and the Drubetskoys.\nThe main characters are:\nIn addition, several real-life historical characters (such as Napoleon and Prince Mikhail Kutuzov) play a prominent part in the book. Many of Tolstoy's characters were based on real people. His grandparents and their friends were the models for many of the main characters; his great-grandparents would have been of the generation of Prince Vassily or Count Ilya Rostov.\nPlot summary.\nBook One.\nThe novel begins in July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soir\u00e9e given by Anna Pavlovna Scherer, the maid of honour and confidante to the dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna. Many of the main characters are introduced as they enter the salon. Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhov is the illegitimate son of a wealthy count, who is dying after a series of strokes. Pierre is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his inheritance. Educated abroad at his father's expense following his mother's death, Pierre is kindhearted but socially awkward, and finds it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to everyone at the soir\u00e9e that Pierre is his father's favorite of all the old count's illegitimate progeny. They respect Pierre during the soiree because his father, Count Bezukhov, is a very rich man, and as Pierre is his favorite, most aristocrats think that the fortune of his father will be given to him even though he is illegitimate.\nAlso attending the soir\u00e9e is Pierre's friend, Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise, a charming society favourite. He is disillusioned with Petersburg society and with married life; feeling that his wife is empty and superficial, he comes to hate her and all women, expressing patently misogynistic views to Pierre when the two are alone. Pierre does not quite know what to do with this, and is made uncomfortable witnessing the marital discord. Pierre had been sent to St Petersburg by his father to choose a career for himself, but he is quite uncomfortable because he cannot find one and everybody keeps on asking about this. Andrei tells Pierre he has decided to become to Prince Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov in the coming war (The Battle of Austerlitz) against Napoleon in order to escape a life he cannot stand.\nThe plot moves to Moscow, Russia's former capital, contrasting its provincial, more Russian ways to the more European society of Saint Petersburg. The Rostov family is introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov and Countess Natalya Rostova are an affectionate couple but forever worried about their disordered finances. They have four children. Thirteen-year-old Natasha (Natalia Ilyinichna) believes herself in love with Boris Drubetskoy, a young man who is about to join the army as an officer. The mother of Boris is Anna Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya who is a childhood friend of the countess Natalya Rostova. Boris is also the godson of Count Bezukhov (Pierre's father). Twenty-year-old Nikolai Ilyich pledges his love to Sonya (Sofia Alexandrovna), his fifteen-year-old cousin, an orphan who has been brought up by the Rostovs. The eldest child, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage to a Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) at nine is the youngest; like his brother, he is impetuous and eager to join the army when of age.\nAt Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys' country estate, Prince Andrei departs for war and leaves his terrified, pregnant wife Lise with his eccentric father Prince Nikolai Andreyevich and devoutly religious sister Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya, who refuses to marry the son of a wealthy aristocrat on account of her devotion to her father and suspicion that the young man would be unfaithful to her.\nThe second part opens with descriptions of the impending Russian-French war preparations. At the Sch\u00f6ngrabern engagement, Nikolai Rostov, now an ensign in the hussars, has his first taste of battle. Boris Drubetskoy introduces him to Prince Andrei, whom Rostov insults in a fit of impetuousness. He is deeply attracted by Tsar Alexander's charisma. Nikolai gambles and socializes with his officer, Vasily Dmitrich Denisov, and befriends the ruthless Fyodor Ivanovich Dolokhov. Bolkonsky, Rostov and Denisov are involved in the disastrous Battle of Austerlitz, in which Prince Andrei is badly wounded as he attempts to rescue a Russian standard.\nThe Battle of Austerlitz is a major event in the book. As the battle is about to start, Prince Andrei thinks the approaching \"day [will] be his Toulon, or his Arcola\", references to Napoleon's early victories. Later in the battle, however, Andrei falls into enemy hands and even meets his hero, Napoleon. But his previous enthusiasm has been shattered; he no longer thinks much of Napoleon, \"so petty did his hero with his paltry vanity and delight in victory appear, compared to that lofty, righteous and kindly sky which he had seen and comprehended\". Tolstoy portrays Austerlitz as an early test for Russia, one which ended badly because the soldiers fought for irrelevant things like glory or renown rather than the higher virtues which would produce, according to Tolstoy, a victory at Borodino during the 1812 invasion.\nBook Two.\nBook Two begins with Nikolai Rostov briefly returning on leave to Moscow accompanied by his friend Denisov, his officer from his Pavlograd Regiment. He spends an eventful winter at home. Natasha has blossomed into a beautiful young girl. Denisov falls in love with her and proposes marriage, but is rejected. Nikolai meets Dolokhov, and they grow closer as friends. Dolokhov falls in love with Sonya, Nikolai's cousin, but as she is in love with Nikolai, she rejects Dolokhov's proposal. Nikolai meets Dolokhov some time later. The resentful Dolokhov challenges Nikolai at cards, and Nikolai loses every hand until he sinks into a 43,000 ruble debt. Although his mother pleads with Nikolai to marry a wealthy heiress to rescue the family from its dire financial straits, he refuses. Instead, he promises to marry his childhood crush and orphaned cousin, the dowry-less Sonya.\nPierre Bezukhov, upon finally receiving his massive inheritance, is suddenly transformed from a bumbling young man into the most eligible bachelor in Russian society. Despite knowing that it is wrong, he is convinced into marriage with Prince Kuragin's beautiful and immoral daughter H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (Elena Vasilyevna Kuragina). H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who is rumored to be involved in an incestuous affair with her brother Anatole, tells Pierre that she will never have children with him. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is also rumored to be having an affair with Dolokhov, who mocks Pierre in public. Pierre loses his temper and challenges Dolokhov to a duel. Unexpectedly (because Dolokhov is a seasoned dueller), Pierre wounds Dolokhov. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne denies her affair, but Pierre is convinced of her guilt and leaves her. In his moral and spiritual confusion, Pierre joins the Freemasons. Much of Book Two concerns his struggles with his passions and his spiritual conflicts. He abandons his former carefree behavior and enters upon a philosophical quest particular to Tolstoy: how should one live a moral life in an ethically imperfect world? The question continually baffles Pierre. He attempts to liberate his serfs, but ultimately achieves nothing of note.\nPierre is contrasted with Prince Andrei Bolkonsky. Andrei recovers from his near-fatal wound in a military hospital and returns home, only to find his wife Lise dying in childbirth. He is stricken by his guilty conscience for not treating her better. His child, Nikolai, survives.\nBurdened with nihilistic disillusionment, Prince Andrei does not return to the army but remains on his estate, working on a project that would codify military behavior to solve problems of disorganization responsible for the loss of life on the Russian side. Pierre visits him and brings new questions: where is God in this amoral world? Pierre is interested in panentheism and the possibility of an afterlife.\nPierre's wife, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, begs him to take her back, and trying to abide by the Freemason laws of forgiveness, he agrees. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne establishes herself as an influential hostess in Petersburg society.\nPrince Andrei feels impelled to take his newly written military notions to Saint Petersburg, naively expecting to influence either the Emperor himself or those close to him. Young Natasha, also in Saint Petersburg, is caught up in the excitement of her first grand ball, where she meets Prince Andrei and briefly reinvigorates him with her vivacious charm. Andrei believes he has found purpose in life again and, after paying the Rostovs several visits, proposes marriage to Natasha. However, Andrei's father dislikes the Rostovs and opposes the marriage, insisting that the couple wait a year before marrying. Prince Andrei leaves to recuperate from his wounds abroad, leaving Natasha distraught. Count Rostov takes her and Sonya to Moscow in order to raise funds for her trousseau.\nNatasha visits the Moscow opera, where she meets H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and her brother Anatole. Anatole has since married a Polish woman whom he abandoned in Poland. He is very attracted to Natasha and determined to seduce her, and conspires with his sister to do so. Anatole succeeds in making Natasha believe he loves her, eventually establishing plans to elope. Natasha writes to Princess Maria, Andrei's sister, breaking off her engagement. At the last moment, Sonya discovers her plans to elope and foils them. Natasha learns from Pierre of Anatole's marriage. Devastated, Natasha makes a suicide attempt and is left seriously ill.\nPierre is initially horrified by Natasha's behavior but realizes he has fallen in love with her. As the Great Comet of 1811\u201312 streaks the sky, life appears to begin anew for Pierre. Prince Andrei coldly accepts Natasha's breaking of the engagement. He tells Pierre that his pride will not allow him to renew his proposal.\nBook Three.\nWith the help of her family, and the stirrings of religious faith, Natasha manages to persevere in Moscow through this dark period. Meanwhile, the whole of Russia is affected by the coming confrontation between Napoleon's army and the Russian army. Pierre convinces himself through gematria that Napoleon is the Antichrist of the \"Book of Revelation\". Old Prince Bolkonsky dies of a stroke knowing that French marauders are coming for his estate. No organized help from any Russian army seems available to the Bolkonskys, but Nikolai Rostov turns up at their estate in time to help put down an incipient peasant revolt. He finds himself attracted to the distraught Princess Maria.\nBack in Moscow, the patriotic Petya joins a crowd in audience of Tzar Alexander and manages to snatch a biscuit thrown from the balcony window of the Cathedral of the Assumption by the Tzar. He is nearly crushed by the throngs in his effort. Under the influence of the same patriotism, his father finally allows him to enlist.\nNapoleon himself is the main character in this section, and the novel presents him in vivid detail, both personally and as both a thinker and would-be strategist. Also described are the well-organized force of over four hundred thousand troops of the French Grande Arm\u00e9e (only one hundred and forty thousand of them actually French-speaking) that marches through the Russian countryside in the late summer and reaches the outskirts of the city of Smolensk. Pierre decides to leave Moscow and go to watch the Battle of Borodino from a vantage point next to a Russian artillery crew. After watching for a time, he begins to join in carrying ammunition. In the midst of the turmoil he experiences first-hand the death and destruction of war; Eug\u00e8ne's artillery continues to pound Russian support columns, while Marshals Ney and Davout set up a crossfire with artillery positioned on the Semyonovskaya heights. The battle becomes a hideous slaughter for both armies and ends in a standoff. The Russians, however, have won a moral victory by standing up to Napoleon's reputedly invincible army. The Russian army withdraws the next day, allowing Napoleon to march on to Moscow. Among the casualties are Anatole Kuragin and Prince Andrei. Anatole loses a leg, and Andrei suffers a grenade wound in the abdomen. Both are reported dead, but their families are in such disarray that no one can be notified.\nBook Four.\nThe Rostovs have waited until the last minute to abandon Moscow, even after it became clear that Kutuzov had retreated past Moscow. The Muscovites are being given contradictory instructions on how to either flee or fight. Count Fyodor Rostopchin, the commander in chief of Moscow, is publishing posters, rousing the citizens to put their faith in religious icons, while at the same time urging them to fight with pitchforks if necessary. Before fleeing himself, he gives orders to burn the city. However, Tolstoy states that the burning of an abandoned city mostly built of wood was inevitable, and while the French blame the Russians, these blame the French. The Rostovs have a difficult time deciding what to take with them, but in the end, Natasha convinces them to load their carts with the wounded and dying from the Battle of Borodino. Unknown to Natasha, Prince Andrei is amongst the wounded.\nWhen Napoleon's army finally occupies an abandoned and burning Moscow, Pierre takes off on a quixotic mission to assassinate Napoleon. He becomes anonymous in all the chaos, shedding his responsibilities by wearing peasant clothes and shunning his duties and lifestyle. The only people he sees are Natasha and some of her family, as they depart Moscow. Natasha recognizes and smiles at him, and he in turn realizes the full scope of his love for her.\nPierre saves the life of a French officer who enters his home looking for shelter, and they have a long, amicable conversation. The next day Pierre goes into the street to resume his assassination plan, and comes across two French soldiers robbing an Armenian family. When one of the soldiers tries to rip the necklace off the young Armenian woman's neck, Pierre intervenes by attacking the soldiers, and is taken prisoner by the French army. He believes he will be executed, but in the end is spared. He witnesses, with horror, the execution of other prisoners.\nPierre becomes friends with a fellow prisoner, Platon Karataev, a Russian peasant with a saintly demeanor. In Karataev, Pierre finally finds what he has been seeking: an honest person of integrity, who is utterly without pretense. Pierre discovers meaning in life simply by interacting with him. After witnessing French soldiers sacking Moscow and shooting Russian civilians arbitrarily, Pierre is forced to march with the Grand Army during its disastrous retreat from Moscow in the harsh Russian winter. After months of tribulation\u2014during which the fever-plagued Karataev is shot by the French\u2014Pierre is finally freed by a Russian raiding party led by Dolokhov and Denisov, after a small skirmish with the French that sees the young Petya Rostov killed in action.\nMeanwhile, Andrei has been taken in and cared for by the Rostovs, fleeing from Moscow to Yaroslavl. He is reunited with Natasha and his sister Maria before the end of the war. In an internal transformation, he loses the fear of death and forgives Natasha in a last act before dying.\nNikolai becomes worried about his family's finances, and leaves the army after hearing of Petya's death. There is little hope for recovery. Given the Rostov's ruin, he does not feel comfortable with the prospect of marrying the wealthy Marya Bolkonsky, but when they meet again they both still feel love for each other. \nAs the novel draws to a close, Pierre's wife H\u00e9l\u00e8ne dies from an overdose of an abortifacient (Tolstoy does not state it explicitly but the euphemism he uses is unambiguous). Pierre is reunited with Natasha, while the victorious Russians rebuild Moscow. Natasha speaks of Prince Andrei's death and Pierre of Karataev's. Both are aware of a growing bond between them in their bereavement. With the help of Princess Maria, Pierre finds love at last and marries Natasha.\nEpilogue in two parts.\nFirst part.\nThe first part of the epilogue begins with the wedding of Pierre and Natasha in 1813. Count Rostov dies soon after, leaving his eldest son Nikolai to take charge of the debt-ridden estate. Nikolai finds himself with the task of maintaining the family on the verge of bankruptcy. His just treatment of peasants earns him respect and love, and his situation improves. He and Maria now have children.\nNikolai and Maria then move to Bald Hills with his mother and Sonya, whom he supports for the rest of their lives. They also raise Prince Andrei's orphaned son, Nikolai Andreyevich (Nikolenka) Bolkonsky.\nAs in all good marriages, there are misunderstandings, but the couples \u2013 Pierre and Natasha, Nikolai and Maria \u2013 remain devoted to their spouses. Pierre and Natasha visit Bald Hills in 1820. There is a hint in the closing chapters that the idealistic, boyish Nikolenka and Pierre would both become part of the Decembrist Uprising. The first epilogue concludes with Nikolenka promising he would do something with which even his late father \"would be satisfied\" (presumably as a revolutionary in the Decembrist revolt).\nSecond part.\nThe second part of the epilogue contains Tolstoy's critique of all existing forms of mainstream history. The 19th-century Great Man Theory claims that historical events are the result of the actions of \"heroes\" and other great individuals; Tolstoy argues that this is impossible because of how rarely these actions result in great historical events. Rather, he argues, great historical events are the result of many smaller events driven by the thousands of individuals involved (he compares this to calculus, and the sum of infinitesimals). He then goes on to argue that these smaller events are the result of an inverse relationship between necessity and free-will, necessity being based on reason and therefore explicable through historical analysis, and free-will being based on \"consciousness\" and therefore inherently unpredictable.\nReception.\nThe novel that made its author \"the true lion of the Russian literature\" (according to Ivan Goncharov) enjoyed great success with the reading public upon its publication and spawned dozens of reviews and analytical essays, some of which (by Dmitry Pisarev, Pavel Annenkov, Dragomirov and Strakhov) formed the basis for the research of later Tolstoy scholars. Yet the Russian press's initial response to the novel was muted, with most critics unable to decide how to classify it. The liberal newspaper \"Golos\" (The Voice, April 3, #93, 1865) was one of the first to react. Its anonymous reviewer posed a question later repeated by many others: \"What could this possibly be? What kind of genre are we supposed to file it to?.. Where is fiction in it, and where is real history?\"\nWriter and critic Nikolai Akhsharumov, writing in (#6, 1867) suggested that \"War and Peace\" was \"neither a chronicle, nor a historical novel\", but a genre merger, this ambiguity never undermining its immense value. Annenkov, who praised the novel too, was equally vague when trying to classify it. \"The cultural history of one large section of our society, the political and social panorama of it in the beginning of the current century\", was his suggestion. \"It is the [social] epic, the history novel and the vast picture of the whole nation's life\", wrote Ivan Turgenev in his bid to define \"War and Peace\" in the foreword for his French translation of \"The Two Hussars\" (published in Paris by in 1875).\nIn general, the literary left received the novel coldly. They saw it as devoid of social critique, and keen on the idea of national unity. They saw its major fault as the \"author's inability to portray a new kind of revolutionary intelligentsia in his novel\", as critic Varfolomey Zaytsev put it. Articles by D. Minayev, and N. Shelgunov in magazine characterized the novel as \"lacking realism\", showing its characters as \"cruel and rough\", \"mentally stoned\", \"morally depraved\" and promoting \"the philosophy of stagnation\". Still, Mikhail Saltykov-Schedrin, who never expressed his opinion of the novel publicly, in private conversation was reported to have expressed delight with \"how strongly this Count has stung our higher society\". Dmitry Pisarev in his unfinished article \"Russian Gentry of Old\" (, , #2, 1868), while praising Tolstoy's realism in portraying members of high society, was still unhappy with the way the author, as he saw it, 'idealized' the old nobility, expressing \"unconscious and quite natural tenderness towards\" the Russian dvoryanstvo. On the opposite front, the conservative press and \"patriotic\" authors (A. S. Norov and P. A. Vyazemsky among them) were accusing Tolstoy of consciously distorting 1812 history, desecrating the \"patriotic feelings of our fathers\" and ridiculing dvoryanstvo.\nOne of the first comprehensive articles on the novel was that of Pavel Annenkov, published in #2, 1868 issue of \"Vestnik Evropy\". The critic praised Tolstoy's masterful portrayal of man at war, marveled at the complexity of the whole composition, organically merging historical facts and fiction. \"The dazzling side of the novel\", according to Annenkov, was \"the natural simplicity with which [the author] transports the worldly affairs and big social events down to the level of a character who witnesses them.\" Annekov thought the historical gallery of the novel was incomplete with the two \"great raznotchintsys\", Speransky and Arakcheev, and deplored the fact that the author stopped at introducing to the novel \"this relatively rough but original element\". In the end the critic called the novel \"the whole epoch in the Russian fiction\".\nSlavophiles declared Tolstoy their \"\" and pronounced \"War and Peace\" \"the Bible of the new national idea\". Several articles on \"War and Peace\" were published in 1869\u201370 in \"Zarya\" magazine by Nikolai Strakhov. \"\"War and Peace\" is the work of genius, equal to everything that the Russian literature has produced before\", he pronounced in the first, smaller essay. \"It is now quite clear that from 1868 when the \"War and Peace\" was published the very essence of what we call Russian literature has become quite different, acquired the new form and meaning\", the critic continued later. Strakhov was the first critic in Russia who declared Tolstoy's novel to be a masterpiece of level previously unknown in Russian literature. Still, being a true Slavophile, he could not fail to see the novel as promoting the major Slavophiliac ideas of \"meek Russian character's supremacy over the rapacious European kind\" (using Apollon Grigoriev's formula). Years later, in 1878, discussing Strakhov's own book \"The World as a Whole\", Tolstoy criticized both Grigoriev's concept (of \"Russian meekness \"vs.\" Western bestiality\") and Strakhov's interpretation of it.\nAmong the reviewers were military men and authors specializing in war literature. Most assessed highly the artfulness and realism of Tolstoy's battle scenes. N. Lachinov, a member of the \"Russky Invalid\" newspaper staff (#69, April 10, 1868) called the Battle of Sch\u00f6ngrabern scenes \"bearing the highest degree of historical and artistic truthfulness\" and totally agreed with the author's view on the Battle of Borodino, which some of his opponents disputed. The army general and respected military writer Mikhail Dragomirov, in an article published in (\"The Military Almanac\", 1868\u201370), while disputing some of Tolstoy's ideas concerning the \"spontaneity\" of wars and the role of commander in battles, advised all the Russian Army officers to use \"War and Peace\" as their desk book, describing its battle scenes as \"incomparable\" and \"serving for an ideal manual to every textbook on theories of military art.\"\nUnlike professional literary critics, most prominent Russian writers of the time supported the novel wholeheartedly. Goncharov, Turgenev, Leskov, Dostoyevsky and Fet have all gone on record as declaring \"War and Peace\" the masterpiece of the Russian literature. Ivan Goncharov in a July 17, 1878 letter to Pyotr Ganzen advised him to choose for translating into Danish \"War and Peace\", adding: \"This is positively what might be called a Russian \"Iliad\". Embracing the whole epoch, it is the grandiose literary event, showcasing the gallery of great men painted by a lively brush of the great master ... This is one of the most, if not the most profound literary work ever\". In 1879, unhappy with Ganzen having chosen \"Anna Karenina\" to start with, Goncharov insisted: \"War and Peace is the extraordinary poem of a novel, both in content and execution. It also serves as a monument to Russian history's glorious epoch when whatever figure you take is a colossus, a statue in bronze. Even [the novel's] minor characters carry all the characteristic features of the Russian people and its life.\" In 1885, expressing satisfaction with the fact that Tolstoy's works had by then been translated into Danish, Goncharov again stressed the immense importance of \"War and Peace\". \"Count Tolstoy really mounts over everybody else here [in Russia]\", he remarked.\nFyodor Dostoyevsky (in a May 30, 1871 letter to Strakhov) described \"War and Peace\" as \"the last word of the landlord's literature and the brilliant one at that\". In a draft version of \"The Raw Youth\" he described Tolstoy as \"a historiograph of the , or rather, its cultural elite\". \"The objectivity and realism impart wonderful charm to all scenes, and alongside people of talent, honour and duty he exposes numerous scoundrels, worthless goons and fools\", he added. In 1876 Dostoyevsky wrote: \"My strong conviction is that a writer of fiction has to have most profound knowledge\u2014not only of the poetic side of his art, but also the reality he deals with, in its historical as well as contemporary context. Here [in Russia], as far as I see it, only one writer excels in this, Count Lev Tolstoy.\"\nNikolai Leskov, then an anonymous reviewer in (\"The Stock Exchange Herald\"), wrote several articles praising highly \"War and Peace\", calling it \"the best ever Russian historical novel\" and \"the pride of the contemporary literature\". Marveling at the realism and factual truthfulness of Tolstoy's book, Leskov thought the author deserved the special credit for \"having lifted up the people's spirit upon the high pedestal it deserved\". \"While working most elaborately upon individual characters, the author, apparently, has been studying most diligently the character of the nation as a whole; the life of people whose moral strength came to be concentrated in the Army that came up to fight mighty Napoleon. In this respect the novel of Count Tolstoy could be seen as an epic of the Great national war which up until now has had its historians but never had its singers\", Leskov wrote.\nAfanasy Fet, in a January 1, 1870 letter to Tolstoy, expressed his great delight with the novel. \"You've managed to show us in great detail the other, mundane side of life and explain how organically does it feed the outer, heroic side of it\", he added.\nIvan Turgenev gradually re-considered his initial skepticism as to the novel's historical aspect and also the style of Tolstoy's psychological analysis. In his 1880 article written in the form of a letter addressed to Edmond Abou, the editor of the French newspaper , Turgenev described Tolstoy as \"the most popular Russian writer\" and \"War and Peace\" as \"one of the most remarkable books of our age\". \"This vast work has the spirit of an epic, where the life of Russia of the beginning of our century in general and in details has been recreated by the hand of a true master ... The manner in which Count Tolstoy conducts his treatise is innovative and original. This is the great work of a great writer, and in it there\u2019s true, real Russia\", Turgenev wrote. It was largely due to Turgenev's efforts that the novel started to gain popularity with the European readership. The first French edition of the \"War and Peace\" (1879) paved the way for the worldwide success of Leo Tolstoy and his works.\nSince then many world-famous authors have praised \"War and Peace\" as a masterpiece of world literature. Gustave Flaubert expressed his delight in a January 1880 letter to Turgenev, writing: \"This is the first class work! What an artist and what a psychologist! The first two volumes are exquisite. I used to utter shrieks of delight while reading. This is powerful, very powerful indeed.\" Later John Galsworthy called \"War and Peace\" \"the best novel that had ever been written\". Romain Rolland, remembering his reading the novel as a student, wrote: \"this work, like life itself, has no beginning, no end. It is life itself in its eternal movement.\" Thomas Mann thought \"War and Peace\" to be \"the greatest ever war novel in the history of literature.\" Ernest Hemingway confessed that it was from Tolstoy that he had been taking lessons on how to \"write about war in the most straightforward, honest, objective and stark way.\" \"I don't know anybody who could write about war better than Tolstoy did\", Hemingway asserted in his 1955 \"Men at War. The Best War Stories of All Time\" anthology.\nIsaak Babel said, after reading \"War and Peace\", \"If the world could write by itself, it would write like Tolstoy.\" Tolstoy \"gives us a unique combination of the 'naive objectivity' of the oral narrator with the interest in detail characteristic of realism. This is the reason for our trust in his presentation.\"\nEnglish translations.\n\"War and Peace\" has been translated into many languages. It has been translated into English on several occasions, starting with Clara Bell working from a French translation. The translators Constance Garnett and Louise and Aylmer Maude knew Tolstoy personally. Translations have to deal with Tolstoy's often peculiar syntax and his fondness for repetitions. Only about 2 percent of \"War and Peace\" is in French; Tolstoy removed the French in a revised 1873 edition, only to restore it later. Most translators follow Garnett retaining some French; Briggs uses no French, while Pevear-Volokhonsky and Amy Mandelker's revision of the Maude translation both retain the French fully.\nList of English translations.\nFull translations:\nAbridged translation:\nTranslation of draft of 1863:\nComparing translations.\nIn the \"Encyclopedia of Literary Translation into English\", academic Zoja Pavlovskis-Petit has this to say about the translations of \"War and Peace\" available in 2000: \"Of all the translations of \"War and Peace\", Dunnigan's (1968) is the best. ... Unlike the other translators, Dunnigan even succeeds with many characteristically Russian folk expressions and proverbs. ... She is faithful to the text and does not hesitate to render conscientiously those details that the uninitiated may find bewildering: for instance, the statement that Boris's mother pronounced his name with a stress on the \"o\" \u2013 an indication to the Russian reader of the old lady's affectation.\"\nOn the Garnett translation Pavlovskis-Petit writes: \"her ...\"War and Peace\" is frequently inexact and contains too many anglicisms. Her style is awkward and turgid, very unsuitable for Tolstoi.\" On the Maudes' translation she comments: \"this should have been the best translation, but the Maudes' lack of adroitness in dealing with Russian folk idiom, and their style in general, place this version below Dunnigan's.\" She further comments on Edmonds's revised translation, formerly on Penguin: \"[it] is the work of a sound scholar but not the best possible translator; it frequently lacks resourcefulness and imagination in its use of English. ... a respectable translation but not on the level of Dunnigan or Maude.\""}
{"title": "Olusegun_Obasanjo", "label": "Politician", "text": "Chief Olusegun Matthew Okikiola Aremu Obasanjo, GCFR, (; ; born 5 March 1937) is a Nigerian political and military leader who served as Nigeria's head of state from 1976 to 1979 and later as its president from 1999 to 2007. Ideologically a Nigerian nationalist, he was a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) from 1999 to 2015, and from 2018 has been a member of the African Democratic Congress party.\nBorn in the village of Ibogun-Olaogun to a farming family of the Owu branch of the Yoruba, Obasanjo was educated largely in Abeokuta. Joining the Nigerian Army, where he specialised in engineering, he spent time assigned in the Congo, Britain, and India, rising to the rank of major. In the latter part of the 1960s, he played a senior role in combating Biafran separatists during the Nigerian Civil War, accepting their surrender in 1970. In 1975, a military coup established a junta with Obasanjo as part of its ruling triumvirate. After the triumvirate's leader, Murtala Muhammed, was assassinated the following year, the Supreme Military Council appointed Obasanjo as head of state. Continuing Murtala's policies, Obasanjo oversaw budgetary cut-backs and an expansion in access to free school education. Increasingly aligning Nigeria with the United States, he also emphasised support for groups opposing white minority rule in southern Africa. Committed to restoring democracy, Obasanjo oversaw the 1979 election, after which he handed over control of Nigeria to the newly elected civilian president, Shehu Shagari. He then retired to Ota, Ogun, where he became a farmer, published four books, and took part in international initiatives to end various African conflicts.\nIn 1993, Sani Abacha seized power in a military coup. Openly critical of Abacha's administration, in 1995 Obasanjo was arrested and convicted of being part of a planned coup, despite protesting his innocence. While imprisoned, he became a born again Christian, with providentialism strongly influencing his subsequent worldview. He was released following Abacha's death in 1998. Entering electoral politics, Obasanjo became the PDP candidate for the 1999 presidential election, which he won comfortably. As president, he de-politicised the military and both expanded the police and mobilised the army to combat widespread ethnic, religious, and secessionist violence. He withdrew Nigeria's military from Sierra Leone and privatised various public enterprises to limit his country's spiralling debt. He was re-elected in the 2003 election. Influenced by Pan-Africanist ideas, he was a keen supporter of the formation of the African Union and served as its chair from 2004 to 2006. Obasanjo's attempts to change the constitution to abolish presidential term limits were unsuccessful and brought criticism. In retirement, he earned a PhD in theology from the National Open University of Nigeria.\nObasanjo has been described as one of the great figures of the second generation of post-colonial African leaders. He received praise both for overseeing Nigeria's transition to representative democracy in the 1970s and for his Pan-African efforts to encourage cooperation across the continent. Critics maintain that he was guilty of corruption, that his administrations oversaw human rights abuses, and that as President he became too interested in consolidating and maintaining his personal power.\nEarly life (1937\u20131958).\nMatthew Olusegun Aremu Obasanjo was born in Ibogun-Olaogun, a village in southwest Nigeria. His later passport gave his date of birth as 5 March 1937, although this was a later estimate, with no contemporary records surviving. His father was Amos Adigun Obaluayesanjo \"Obasanjo\" Bankole and his mother was Bernice Ashabi Bankole. The first of nine children, only he and a sister (Adunni Oluwole Obasanjo) survived childhood. He was born to the Owu branch of the Yoruba people. The village church was part of a mission set up by the U.S. Southern Baptist Church and Obasanjo was raised Baptist. His village also contained Muslims and his sister later converted to Islam to marry a Muslim man.\nObasanjo's father was a farmer and until he was eleven years old, the boy was involved in agricultural labour. Aged eleven, he joined the village primary school, and after three years, in 1951, he moved on to the Baptist Day School in Abeokuta's Owu quarter. In 1952 he transferred to the Baptist Boys' High School, also in the town. His school fees were partly financed by state grants. Obasanjo did well academically, and at school became a keen Boy Scout. Although there is no evidence that he was then involved in any political groups, it was at secondary school that Obasanjo rejected his forename of \"Matthew\" as an anti-colonial act. Meanwhile, Obasanjo's father had abandoned his wife and two children. Falling into poverty, Obasanjo's mother had to operate in trading to survive. To pay his school fees, Obasanjo worked on cocoa and kola farms, fished, collected firewood, and sold sand to builders. During the school holidays he also worked at the school, cutting the grass and other manual jobs.\nIn 1956, Obasanjo took his secondary school exams, having borrowed money to pay for the entry fees. That same year, he began courting Oluremi Akinlawon, the Owu daughter of a station master. They were engaged to be married by 1958. Leaving school, he moved to Ibadan, where he took a teaching job. There, he sat the entrance exam for University College Ibadan, but although he passed it he found that he could not afford the tuition fees. Obasanjo then decided to pursue a career as a civil engineer, and to access this profession, in 1958 answered an advert for officer cadet training in the Nigerian Army.\nEarly military career.\nMilitary training: 1958\u20131959.\nIn March 1958, Obasanjo enlisted in the Nigerian Army. He saw it as an opportunity to continue his education while earning a salary; he did not immediately inform his family, fearing that his parents would object. It was at this time that the Nigerian Army was being transferred to the control of the Nigerian colonial government, in preparation for an anticipated full Nigerian independence, and there were attempts afoot to get more native Nigerians into the higher ranks of its military.\nHe was then sent to a Regular Officers' Training School at Teshie in Ghana. When stationed abroad, he sent letters and presents to his fianc\u00e9 in Nigeria. In September 1958 he was selected for six months of additional training at Mons Officer Cadet School in Aldershot, southern England. Obasanjo disliked it there, believing that it was a classist and racist institution, and found it difficult adjusting to the colder, wetter English weather. It reinforced his negative opinions of the British Empire and its right to rule over its colonised subjects. At Mons, he received a commission and a certificate in engineering. While Obasanjo was in England, his mother died. His father then died a year later. \nIn 1959 Obasanjo returned to Nigeria. There, he was posted to Kaduna as an infantry subaltern with the Fifth Battalion. His time in Kaduna was the first time that Obasanjo lived in a Muslim-majority area. It was while he was there, in October 1960, that Nigeria became an independent country. \nCongo crisis: 1960\u20131961.\nShortly after, the Fifth Battalion were sent to the Congo as part of a United Nations peacekeeping force. There, the battalion were stationed in Kivu Province, with their headquarters at Bukavu. In the Congo, Obasanjo and others were responsible for protecting civilians, including Belgian settlers, against Soldiers who had mutinied against Patrice Lumumba's government. In February 1961, Obasanjo was captured by the mutineers while he was evacuating Roman Catholic missionaries from a station near Bukavu. The mutineers considered executing him but were ordered to release him. In May 1961, the Fifth Battalion left the Congo and returned to Nigeria. During the conflict, he had been appointed a temporary captain. He later noted that the time spent in the Congo strengthened the \"Pan-African fervour\" of his battalion.\nReturn from the Congo: 1961\u20131966.\nOn his return, Obasanjo bought his first car, and was hospitalised for a time with a stomach ulcer. On his recovery, he was transferred to the Army Engineering Corps. In 1962 he was stationed at the Royal College of Military Engineering in England. There, he excelled and was described as \"the best Commonwealth student ever\". That year, he paid for Akinlawon to travel to London where she could join a training course. The couple married in June 1963 at the Camberwell Green Registry Office, only informing their families after the event. That year, Obasanjo was ordered back to Nigeria, although his wife remained in London for three more years to finish her course. Once in Nigeria, Obasanjo took command of the Field Engineering Squadron based at Kaduna. Within the military, Obasanjo steadily progressed through the ranks, becoming a major in 1965. He used his earning to purchase land, in the early 1960s obtaining property in Ibadan, Kaduna, and Lagos. In 1965, Obasanjo was sent to India. En route, he visited his wife in London. In India, he studied at the Defence Services Staff College in Wellington and then the School of Engineering in Poona. Obasanjo was appalled at the starvation that he witnessed in India although took an interest in the country's culture, something that encouraged him to read books on comparative religion.\nNigerian Civil War.\nPre-Civil War career: 1966\u20131967.\nObasanjo flew back to Nigeria in January 1966 to find the country in the midst of a military coup led by Major Emmanuel Ifeajuna. Almost all of those involved in organising the coup were from the Igbo people of southern Nigeria. Obasanjo was among those warning that the situation could descend into civil war. He offered to serve as an intermediary between the coup plotters and the civilian government, which had transferred power to the military Commander-in-Chief Johnson Aguiyi-Ironsi. As the coup failed, Olusegun met Ironsi in Lagos. Ironsi soon ended federalism in Nigeria through his unification decree in May 1966, something which inflamed ethnic tensions. In late July, a second coup took place. In Ibadan, troops of northern Nigerian origin rebelled and killed Ironsi, also massacring around two hundred Igbo soldiers. General Yakubu Gowon took power.\nWhile this coup was taking place, Obasanjo was in Maiduguri. Hearing of it, he quickly returned to Kaduna. There, he found that northern troops from the Third Battalion were rounding up, torturing, and killing Igbo soldiers. The Governor of Northern Nigeria, Hassan Katsina, recognised that although Olusegun was not Igbo, as a southerner he was still in danger from the mutinous troops. To protect them, Katsina sent Olusegun and his wife back to Maiduguri for ten days, while the violence abated. After this, Obasanjo sent his wife to Lagos while returning to Kaduna himself, where he remained until January 1967. At this point he was the most senior Yoruba officer present in the north.\nIn January 1967, Obasanjo was posted to Lagos as the Chief Army Engineer. Tensions between the Igbo and northern ethnic groups continued to grow, and in May the Igbo military officer C. Odumegwu Ojukwu declared the independence of Igbo-majority areas in the southeast, forming the Republic of Biafra. On 3 July, Nigeria's government posted Obasanjo to Ibadan to serve as commander of the Western State. The fighting between the Nigerian Army and the Biafran separatists broke out on 6 July. On 9 July, Ojukwu sent a column of Biafran troops over the Niger Bridge in an attempt to seize the Mid-West, a position from which it could attack Lagos. Obasanjo sought to block the roads leading to the city. The Yoruba commander Victor Banjo, who was leading the Biafran attack force, tried to convince Obasanjo to let them through, but he declined.\nCivil War command: 1967\u20131970.\nObasanjo was then appointed the rear commander of Murtala Muhammed's Second Division, which was operating in the Mid-West. Based at Ibadan, Obasanjo was responsible for ensuring that the Second Division was kept supplied. In the city, Obasanjo taught a course in military science at the University of Ibadan and built his contacts in the Yoruba elite. During the war, there was popular unrest in the Western State, and to avoid responsibility for these issues, Obasanjo resigned from the Western State Executive Council. While Obasanjo was away from Ibadan in November 1968, armed villagers mobilised by the farmers' Agbekoya Association attacked the Ibadan City Hall. Troops retaliated, killing ten of the rioters. When Obasanjo returned he ordered a court of inquiry into the events.\nGowon decide to replace Colonel Benjamin Adekunle, who was leading the attack on Biafra, but needed another senior Yoruba. He chose Obasanjo, despite the latter's lack of combat experience. Obasanjo arrived at Port Harcourt to take up the new position on 16 May 1969; he was now in charge of between 35,000 and 40,000 troops. He spent his first six weeks repelling a Biafran attack on Aba. He toured every part of the front, and was wounded while doing so. These actions earned him a reputation for courage among his men. In December, Obasanjo launched Operation Finishing Touch, ordering his troops to advance towards Umuahia, which they took on Christmas Day. This cut Biafra in half. On 7 January 1970 he then launched Operation Tail-Wind, capturing the Uli airstrip on 12 January. At this, the Biafran leaders agreed to surrender.\nOn 13 January, Obasanjo met with Biafran military commander Philip Effiong. Obasanjo insisted that Biafran troops surrender their arms and that a selection of the breakaway state's leaders go to Lagos and formally surrender to Gowon. The next day, Obasanjo spoke on regional radio, urging citizens to stay in their homes and guaranteeing their safety. Many Biafrans and foreign media sources feared that the Nigerian Army would commit widespread atrocities against the defeated population, although Obasanjo was keen to prevent this. He ordered his troops in the region to remain within their barracks, maintain that the local police should take responsibility for law and order. The Third Division, which was more isolated, did carry out reprisal attacks on the local population. Obasanjo was tough on the perpetrators, having those guilty of looting flogged and those guilty of rape shot. Gowon's government made Obasanjo responsible for reintegrating Biafra into Nigeria, in which position he earned respect for emphasising magnanimity. As an engineer, he emphasised restoration of the water supply; by May 1970 all major towns in the region were reconnected to the water supply. Obasanjo's role in ending the war made him a war hero and a nationally known figure in Nigeria.\nPost-Civil War career: 1970\u20131975.\nIn June 1970, Obasanjo returned to Abeokuta, where crowds welcomed him as a returning hero. He was then posted to Lagos as the Brigadier commanding the Corps of Engineers. In October, Gowon announced that the military government would transfer authority to a civilian administration in 1976. In the meantime, a ban on political parties remained in forces; Gowon made little progress towards establishing a civilian government. Under the military government, Obasanjo sat on the decommissioning committee which recommended dramatic reductions of troop numbers in the Nigerian Army over the course of the 1970s. In 1974 Obasanjo went to the UK for a course at the Royal College of Defence Studies. On returning, in January 1975 Gowon appointed him as the Commissioner for Works and Housing, a position he held for seven months, during which he was largely responsible for building military barracks.\nIn 1970, Obasanjo bought a former Lebanese company in Ibadan, employing an agent to manage it. In 1973 he registered a business, Temperance Enterprises Limited, through which he could embark on commercial ventures after retiring from the military. He also continued to invest in property; by 1974 he owned two houses in Lagos and one each in Ibadan and Abeokuta. Rumours arose that Obasanjo engaged in the corruption that was becoming increasingly widespread in Nigeria, although no hard evidence of this ever emerged. His marriage with Oluremi became strained as she opposed his relationships with other women. In the mid-1970s their marriage was dissolved. In 1976 he married Stella Abebe in a traditional Yoruba ceremony.\nIn Murtala's government.\nCoup d'\u00e9tat of 1975 and aftermath.\nIn July 1975, a coup led by Shehu Musa Yar'Adua and Joseph Garba ousted Gowon, who fled to Britain. They had not informed Obasanjo of their plans as he was known to be critical of coups as an instrument of regime change. The coup plotters wanted to replace Gowon's autocratic rule with a triumvirate of three brigadiers whose decisions could be vetoed by a Supreme Military Council. For this triumvirate, they convinced General Murtala Muhammed to become head of state, with Obasanjo as his second-in-command, and Danjuma as the third. Iliffe noted that of the triumvirate, Obasanjo was \"the work-horse and the brains\" and was the most eager for a return to civilian rule. Together, the triumvirate introduces austerity measures to stem inflation, established a Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau, replaced all military governors with new officers who reported directly to Obasanjo as Chief of Staff, and launched \"Operation Deadwood\" through which they fired 11,000 officials from the civil service.\nChief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters: 1975\u201376.\nIn October 1975, the government announced plans for an election which would result in civilian rule in October 1979. It also declared plans to create a committee to draft a new constitution, with Obasanjo largely responsible for selecting the 49 committee members. On the recommendation of the Irifeke Commission, the government also announced the creation of seven new states; at Obasanjo's insistence, Abeokuta was to become the capital of one of these new states, Ogun. Also on the commission's recommendation, it announced gradual plans to move the Nigerian capital from Lagos to the more central Abuja. In January 1976, both Obasanjo and Danjuma were promoted to the ranks of Lieutenant General.\nBoth Murtala and Obasanjo were committed to ending ongoing European colonialism and white minority rule in southern Africa, a cause reflected in their foreign policy choices. This cause increasingly became a preoccupation for Obasanjo. After Angola secured independence from Portugal, a civil war broke out in the country. Nigeria recognised the legitimacy of the government declared by the MPLA, a Marxist group backed by the Soviet Union, because the rival FNLA and UNITA were being assisted by the white minority government in South Africa. As well as providing material aid to the MPLA, Nigeria began lobbying other African countries to also recognise the MPLA administration, and by early 1976 most states in the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) had done so. In February 1976, Obasanjo led a Nigerian delegation to an MPLA anniversary celebration in Luanda, where he declared: \"This is a symbolic date, marking the beginning of the final struggle against colonialism, imperialism and racism in Africa.\"\nMurtala's assassination: 13 February 1976.\nIn February 1976, Colonel Buka Suka Dimka launched a coup against Nigeria's government, during which General Murtala Muhammed was assassinated. An attempt was also made on Obasanjo's life, but the wrong individual was killed. Dimka lacked widespread support among the military and his coup failed, forcing him to flee. Obasanjo did not attend Murtala's funeral in Kano, but declared that the government would finance construction of a mosque on the burial site.\nAfter the assassination, Obasanjo attended a meeting of the Supreme Military Council. He expressed his desire to resign from government, but the Council successfully urged him to replace Murtala as head of state. He therefore became the council's chair. Concerned about further attempts on his life, Obasanjo moved into the Dodan Barracks, while 39 people accused of being part of Dimka's coup were executed, generating accusations that Obasanjo's response was excessive. As head of state, Obasanjo vowed to continue Murtala's policies.\nMilitary Head of State (1976\u20131979).\nMilitary triumvirate.\nAware of the danger of alienating northern Nigerians, Obasanjo brought General Shehu Yar'Adua as his replacement and second-in-command as Chief of Staff, Supreme Headquarters completing the military triumvirate, with Obasanjo as head of state and General Theophilus Danjuma as Chief of Army Staff, the three went on to re-establish control over the military regime. Obasanjo encouraged debate and consensus among the Supreme Military Council. Many wondered why Obasanjo \u2014 as a Yoruba and a Christian \u2014 had appointed Yar'Adua, a member of the northern aristocracy, as his second-in-command, rather than a fellow Yoruba Christian.\nObasanjo emphasised national concerns over those of the regions; he encouraged both children and adults to recite the new national pledge and the national anthem. Interested in getting a broader range of perspectives, each Saturday he held an informal seminar on a topical issue to which people other than politicians and civil servants were invited. Among those whose advice he sought were Islamic scholars and traditional chiefs.\nEconomic policy.\nBy the mid-1970s, Nigeria had an overheated economy with a 34% inflation rate. To deal with Nigeria's economic problems, Obasanjo pursued austerity measures to reduce public expenditure. In his 1976 budget, Obasanjo proposed to reduce government expenditure by a sixth, curtailing prestige projects while spending more on education, health, housing, and agriculture. He also set up an anti-inflation task force, and within a year of Obasanjo taking office, inflation had fallen to 30%. Obasanjo was generally adverse to borrowing money, but with the support of the World Bank and International Monetary Fund Nigeria took out a $1\u00a0billion loan from a syndicate of banks. Leftist critics argued that doing so left the country subservient to Western capitalism. In the subsequent two years of Obasanjo's government, Nigeria borrowed a further $4,983\u00a0million.\nNigeria was undergoing nearly 3% annual population growth during the 1970s, something which would double the country's population in just over 25 years. Obasanjo later noted that he was unaware of this at the time, with his government having no policy on population control. Nigeria's population growth contributed to rapid urbanisation and an urban housing shortage. To deal with this, Obasanjo's 1976 budget outlined plans for the construction of 200,000 new housing units by 1980, although ultimately only 28,500 were built. In 1976 Obasanjo's government also announced rent and price controls. To counteract the disruption of labour strikes, in 1976 Obasanjo's government introduced legislation that defined most major industries as essential services, banned strikes within them, and authorised the detention of disruptive union leaders. In 1978 it merged 42 unions into the single Nigerian Labour Congress.\nObasanjo continued with three major irrigation schemes in northern Nigeria that were first announced under Murtala: the Kano River Project, the Bakalori Scheme, and the South Chad Irrigation Project. His government also continued the Agricultural Development Projects launched in Funtua, Gusau, and Gombe. Some reforestation projects were also initiated to stall the encroachment of the Sahara Desert in the north. To meet the country's growing demand for electricity, Obasanjo oversaw the launch of two new hydroelectric projects and a thermal plant. The oil industry remained an important part of Nigeria's economy and under Obasanjo the Ministry of Petroleum Resources was merged with the Nigerian National Oil Corporation to form the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). Obasanjo also supported the creation of a liquefaction plant at Bonny, which was 62% financed by the NNPC; the project was abandoned by his successor amid spiralling cost increases. Obasanjo also continued the planning of the Ajaokuta integrated steel mill, an inherited project that many critics in the civil service argued was unviable.\nIn the mid-1970s Nigeria also faced declining agricultural production, a process caused by successive governments finding it cheaper to import food than grow it domestically. In May 1976, Obasanjo launched Operation Feed the Nation, a project to revitalise small-scale farming and which involved students being paid to farm during the holidays. The project also involved abolishing duties on livestock feed and farm implements, subsidizing the use of fertilisers, and easing agricultural credit. In March 1978 Obasanjo issued the Land Use Decree which gave the state propriety rights over all land. This was designed to stop land hoarding and land speculation, and brought praise from the Nigerian left although was disliked by many land-owning families. Obasanjo saw it as one of his government's main achievements.\nDomestic policies.\nObasanjo continued the push for universal primary education in Nigeria, a policy inherited from Gowon. He introduced the Primary Education Act in 1976; between 1975\u201376 and 1979\u201380, enrolment in free but voluntary primary schooling grew from 6\u00a0million to 12.5\u00a0million, although there was a shortage of teachers and materials to cope with the demand. In the 1977\u201378 school year, Obasanjo introduced free secondary educational in technical subjects, something extended to all secondary schooling in 1979\u201380.\nConcomitantly, Nigeria cut back on university funding; in 1978 it ceased issuing student loans and trebled university food and accommodation charges. Student protests erupted in several cities, resulting in fatal shootings in Lagos and Zaria. In response to the unrest, Obasanjo closed several universities, banned political activity on campus, and proscribed the National Union of Nigerian Students. The severity of these measures was perhaps due to suspicions that the student unrest was linked to a planned military coup that was uncovered in February 1978. Obasanjo was frustrated at the protesting student's behaviour, arguing that it reflected a turn away from traditional values such as respect for elders.\nAs a consequence of Nigeria's state-directed development, the country saw a rapid growth in the public sector. Evidence emerged of extensive corruption in the country's government, and while accusations were often made against Obasanjo himself, no hard evidence was produced. To hinder the image of corruption in the government, Obasanjo's administration banned the use of Mercedes cars as government transport and instead introduced more modest Peugeot 504s. The import of champagne was also banned. Pushing for cut-backs in the military, Obasanjo's government saw 12,000 soldiers demobilised over the course of 1976 and 1977. These troops went through new rehabilitation centres to assist them in adjusting to civilian life.\nObasanjo was also accused of being responsible for political repression. In one famous instance, the compound of the Nigerian musician and political activist Fela Kuti, Kalakuta Republic, was raided and burned to the ground after a member of his entourage was involved in an altercation with military personnel. Fela and his family were beaten and raped and his aged mother, the political activist and founding mother Chief Funmilayo Ransome Kuti, was thrown from a window. This resulted in serious injuries, and eventually led to her death. Fela subsequently carried a coffin to the then presidential residence at Dodan barracks in Lagos as a protest against the government's political repression.\nForeign policy.\nObasanjo was eager to establish Nigeria as a prominent leader in Africa and under his tenure its influence in the continent increased. He revived Gowon's plan to hold the second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture in Nigeria; it took place in Lagos in February 1977, although domestic critics argued that it was too expensive. Obasanjo gave low priority to the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and angered many of its Francophone members after insisting that, as the largest financial contributor to the organisation, Nigeria should host the organisation's headquarters in Lagos. Relations with nearby Ghana also declined; in 1979, Nigeria cut off oil supplies to the country to protest the execution of political opponents by Jerry Rawlings' new military junta.\nUnder Obasanjo, Nigeria loosened its longstanding ties with the United Kingdom and aligned more closely with the United States. Obasanjo was favourable to the U.S. government of Jimmy Carter, who was elected in 1976, because of Carter's commitment to ensuring majority rule across southern Africa. Carter's ambassador to Nigeria, Andrew Young, formed a close personal friendship with Obasanjo, while Carter visited Nigeria in 1978. However, the decision to shift allegiances was made for pragmatic rather than ideological reasons; the discovery of oil in the North Sea meant that the UK had become a competitor rather than a customer of Nigerian oil. Obasanjo's government was also angry that the UK refused to extradite Gowon and suspected that the British government might have been involved in the coup against Murtala. For these reasons, in 1976 it considered suspending diplomatic relations with the UK, but ultimately did not. Obasanjo nevertheless refused to visit the UK and discouraged his officials from doing so. Relations were further damaged when Margaret Thatcher became British Prime Minister in 1979, initiating a warmer British approach to the white minority administrations of Rhodesia and South Africa. In response, Nigeria seized a British tanker that was believed to be transporting Nigerian oil to South Africa, banned British firms from competing for Nigerian contracts, and nationalised British Petroleum's Nigerian operations. \nObasanjo was also eager to hasten the end of white minority rule in southern Africa; according to Iliffe, this became \"the centrepiece of his foreign policy\". Nigeria gave grants to those fighting white minority rule in the region, allowed these groups to open offices in Lagos, and offered sanctuary to various refugees fleeing the governments of southern Africa. Taking a hard line against the apartheid regime in South Africa, Obasanjo announced that Nigeria would not take part in the 1976 Summer Olympics because New Zealand, which was competing, had sporting ties with South Africa, a country that was banned from competing due to apartheid. In 1977, Obasanjo barred any contractors with South African links from operating in Nigeria; the main companies that were hit were British Petroleum and Barclays Bank. That same year, Nigeria hosted the United Nations Conference for Action Against Apartheid in Lagos, while Obasanjo visited the U.S. in October where he urged the country to stop selling arms to South Africa. While in the country he addressed the United Nations General Assembly and two weeks later Nigeria received a seat on the United Nations Security Council.\nOpposition to white minority rule in Rhodesia had sparked the Rhodesian Bush War and Obasanjo's government maintained that armed struggle was the only option for overthrowing Rhodesia's government. He encouraged unity among the various anti-government factions there, urging Robert Mugabe, the head of ZANU, to accept the leadership of his rival, Joshua Nkomo of ZAPU. In 1977, the UK and US drew up proposals for a transition to majority rule in Rhodesia, amid a period in which the country would be under the management of United Nations forces. Obasanjo backed the plan, and visited Tanzania, Zambia, Mozambique, and the Democratic Republic of Congo to urge their governments to do the same. However, after Thatcher became UK Prime Minister, Nigeria distanced itself from British efforts to end the Rhodesian Bush War and was excluded from any significant role in the UK-brokered process that led to multi-racial democratic elections in Rhodesia.\nAs head of state, Obasanjo attended OAU summits. At that held in July 1977, he proposed the formation of a standing committee to mediate disputes between OAU member states. At the 1978 conference, he warned of interference from both sides in the Cold War. At the next conference, he urged the formation of a Pan-African military which could engage in peace-keeping efforts on the continent. To promote Nigeria's role internationally, Obasanjo involved himself in various mediation efforts across Africa. In 1977 he persuaded Benin and Togo to end their border dispute and reopen their frontier. He also attempted to mediate a quarrel among several East African states and thus prevent the collapse of the East African Community, but failed in this attempt. As the chair of the OAU mediation committee, he tried to mediate the Ogaden dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia but was again unsuccessful. He also failed to mend the breach that had emerged between Angola and the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nOn behalf of the OAU, Obasanjo held a conference at Kano to mediate the Chadian Civil War. Several factions agreed to a ceasefire, to form a government of national unity, and to allow Nigerian troops to act as peacekeepers. The war nevertheless continued and Nigeria responded by cutting off its oil supply to Chad. A second conference on the conflict took place in Lagos in August 1979, resulting in the formation of another short-lived transitional government. In the final year of his military government, he headed an OAU mission to resolve the conflict in Western Sahara.\nTransfer of power.\nThe military government has assembled a constituent drafting committee to devise a new constitution which could be used amid a transfer to civilian rule. The committee argued that Nigeria should change its governance system, which was based on the British parliamentary system, to one based on the U.S. presidential system whereby a single elected president would be both head of state and head of government. To avoid this president becoming a dictator, as had happened elsewhere in Africa, it argued for various checks on their power, including a federal structure whereby independent elected institutions would exist at the federal, state, and local level. The draft constitution was published in October 1976 and debated in public for the following year. A constituent assembly met to discuss the draft in October 1977. The assembly deadlocked over what role to give sharia law in the constitution. Obasanjo called the assembly together and warned them of the social impact of their decision, urging them to take a more conciliatory attitude. In September 1978, the Supreme Military Council announced the new constitution; it had made several amendments to the version put forward by the constituent assembly.\nAlong with the new constitution, Obasanjo lifted the ban on political parties. A variety of groups then formed to compete in the ensuing election, most notably the Unity Party of Yoruba, the Nigerian People's Party, and the National Party of Nigeria. Obasanjo was angered that many of the politicians were making promises that they could not keep. The elections took place over the course of July and August 1979. Turnout was low, at between 30 and 40 percent of legally registered voters, and there was rigging on various sides, although it was peaceful. There was debate as to who won the presidential vote, and Obasanjo refused to adjudicate, insisting that the Electoral Commission take on that role. They declared that Shehu Shagari was the winner, something that the runner up, Obafemi Awolowo, unsuccessfully challenged at the Supreme Court. Shagari took office in October 1979; at his inauguration ceremony, Obasanjo presented Shagari with a copy of the new constitution. This marked the start of Nigeria's Second Republic.\nObasanjo's role in returning Nigeria to civilian rule would form the basis of the good reputation he retained for the next two decades. However, various domestic and foreign individuals, including the Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda and Togo President Gnassingb\u00e9 Eyad\u00e9ma, urged him to remain in power. His refusal to back Awolowo, a fellow Yoruba, earned him the enmity of much of the Yoruba elite. Awolowo accused Obasanjo of orchestrating Shagari's victory, something Obasanjo strenuously denied.\nPre-presidency (1979\u20131999).\nBefore he left office, in April 1979, Obasanjo promoted himself to the role of general; as a four-star general he continued to receive a salary from the state. Having left office in October, he returned to Abeokuta. Following a six-week course at an agricultural training college, Obasanjo then set himself up as a farmer, hoping to set an example in encouraging agricultural self-reliance. He obtained at least 230 hectares of land in Ota on which to establish his farm, there moving in to a brick farmhouse. There was local hostility to his obtaining so much land, and much litigation was brought against him because of it. His agricultural activities were organised through his Temperance Enterprises Limited, later renamed Obasanjo's Farms Limited. He devoted particular attention to poultry farming; by the mid-1980s, his farm was hatching 140,000 chicks a week. He developed farms elsewhere in Yorubaland, and by 1987 he employed over 400 workers at eight locations. As did other senior Yoruba figures, Obasanjo sponsored poor students who attended his former school in Abeokuta.\nObasanjo grew critical of Shagari's civilian government, deeming the president weak and ill-prepared. Nigeria entered economic recession due to fluctuations in global oil prices. In May 1983, senior military figures asked Obasanjo to take over control in the country again, but he declined. In December, they overthrew Shagari without Obasanjo's involvement, in a coup that saw little violence. Muhammadu Buhari became the new military head of state. Obasanjo was initially supportive of Buhari's government, stating that representative democracy had failed in Nigeria. He praised Buhari's War Against Indiscipline, his halving of imports, and his restoration of a balanced budget. In August 1985, Buhari was also overthrown, with the Army Chief of Staff Ibrahim Babangida taking power. Obasanjo was critical of some of the economic reforms that Babangida introduced, including the devaluation of the naira. By 1992, his opposition to Babangida's rule had led him to call for a re-democratisation of Nigeria. He also began to reject the economic indigenisation policies of the 1970s, arguing that the constitution should prohibit the confiscation of foreign investments. Instead, he thought the government should emphasise private-led development. He became increasingly concerned by rapid population growth, a topic he had ignored while in power, urging Nigerians to have smaller families \"in their own economic and national socio-economic interest\".\nDuring the eleven years after Obasanjo left office, he published four books. In 1980, Obasanjo was a Distinguished Fellow at the University of Ibadan, where he wrote \"My Command\", an account of his experiences during the civil war; it was published in November that year. Some readers criticised what they saw as Obasanjo's disloyalty to Murtala Muhammed, while Robert Adeyinka Adebayo, a senior Yoruba political figure, urged for the book to be withdrawn to prevent it sowing division. A more positive assessment was made by his friend, Ken Saro-Wiwa, who called it masterly but believed that it had involved much editorial assistance. In 1987 he published \"Nzeogwu\", a memoir of his friend Chukwuma Nzeogwu, with whom he had served in the Congo. 1989 saw the publication of Obasanjo's next book, \"Constitution for National Integration and Development\", in which he warned against Babangida's argument for instituting a two-party system in Nigeria. In 1990 his third book, \"Not My Will\", was published. It provided an account of his time governing the country.\nInternational activities:1979\u20131993.\nSeeking to retain influence on the global stage, Obasanjo launched the Africa Leadership Forum from his Ota farm. From 1981 to 1982 he also sat on the Palme Commission, a group chaired by the former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme which discussed disarmament and international security. Obasanjo followed this with membership on similar panels for the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and the Inter-Action Council of Former Heads of Government. When Javier P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar, the UN Secretary-General, fell ill, Obasanjo was considered as a potential successor. After P\u00e9rez de Cu\u00e9llar announced his resignation, Obasanjo began campaigning to replace him. At a vote of the UN Security Council, he came third, with Egypt's Boutros Boutros-Ghali taking on the role. He left his home on several visits; in 1986 he visited Japan, and in 1987 the U.S.\nAmid a dispute in the Commonwealth of Nations over the UK's more lenient view of South Africa, it was agreed that an Eminent Persons Group (EPG) would be formed to initiate dialogue with the South African government in the hope of encouraging it toward dismantling apartheid. At the recommendation of Nigeria's Deputy Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Emeka Anyaoku, Obasanjo was nominated to co-chair the group alongside former Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser. Obasanjo reluctantly agreed. In February 1986 he and Fraser travelled to Cape Town where they asked to meet with the imprisoned anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela, a prominent member of the banned African National Congress (ANC). Obasanjo alone was permitted to meet with Mandela; he later commented that he was greatly impressed by him. Obasanjo then met with senior ANC figures in exile in Lusaka. \nIn March 1986, the entirety of the EPG visited South Africa, during a period of growing domestic unrest and violence. There they met with senior government figures, including Prime Minister P. W. Botha, whom Obasanjo later described as the most intolerant man he had ever met. The EPG's report stated that while a majority of South Africans desired a non-violent negotiated settlement between the government and anti-apartheid groups, the former was unwilling to contemplate this and had made no significant progress towards ending apartheid. The EPG thus proposed that further international pressure was necessary. A Commonwealth committee accepted the report's findings, with the UK dissenting; this left Obasanjo further frustrated with Thatcher. The Commonwealth then commissioned him to head a committee to determine what the Frontline States needed to defend themselves from South African incursions.\nAfter Botha was replaced by F. W. de Klerk, the latter freed Mandela from prison. One of Mandela's first foreign trips was to Nigeria, where he visited Obasanjo at his home. Two months later, Obasanjo led a Nigerian delegation to South Africa for talks with prominent political figures. In September 1991 he visited again, where he urged the Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi to engage in negotiations with other factions to help end apartheid and hold a fully representative election. \nObasanjo also worked on developments elsewhere in Africa. He visited Angola twice during 1988, contributing to efforts to end the civil war there. He also visited Sudan three times between 1987 and 1989, unsuccessfully encouraging negotiations to end the Second Sudanese Civil War. He then served as an observer at the 1994 Mozambican general election. In 1994 and 1995 he visited Burundi, where he worked to calm tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups. He had begun calling for closer integration across Africa, proposing this could be achieved through the formation of six regional confederations. In June 1987, he had sketched out plans for an Africa Leadership Forum, which would help to provide skills and training for politicians from across the continent. It began holding meetings, known as the Farm House Dialogues, from Obasanjo's home about six times a year. It also held quarterly international meetings and issued a quarterly magazine, \"Africa Forum\", between 1991 and 1993.\nOpposing Abacha: 1992\u20131995.\nObasanjo voiced concern that, despite his professed claims to support a return to democracy, Babangida had no intention of stepping down as military head of state. After the presidential primaries were cancelled in 1992, Obasanjo and Anthony Enahoro launched the Association for Democracy and Good Governance in Nigeria. The group's inaugural meeting brought together 31 domestic political figures at Ota in May 1993. An election followed in June 1993, which saw low turnout. Moshood Abiola of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) claimed victory, but this was challenged in court. Babangida then annulled the election result, promising a second election soon after. The SDP opposed any second election as they argued that their candidate had already won the first. Babangida then agreed to step down in favour of an interim civilian government, led by Ernest Shonekan, which took power in August 1993 and set out plans for new elections in February 1994. \nMeanwhile, Sani Abacha consolidated his control of the military and in November 1993 pressured Shonekan into resigning, allowing himself to take power. Obasanjo had telephoned Abacha prior to the coup, urging him not to take this course of action. After Abacha had seized power, he asked Obasanjo to meet with him. The latter did, but refused to support Abacha's government until it announced a date for its own departure. Abacha then abolished the existing political parties and democratic institutions and called for politicians from various backgrounds to join his Federal Executive Council; Obasanjo refused to nominate anyone for this council.\nObasanjo began warning that Nigeria was headed towards another civil war along ethnic divisions, and in May 1994 he and Yar'Adua launched the National Unity Promoters, a group dedicated to preventing this outcome. In June, Abiola unilaterally declared himself Nigeria's president and was arrested for treason. Although Obasanjo refused to endorse Abiola's claim, he did advise Abacha not to arrest him. He then led a group of traditional leaders at a meeting in which they attempted to initiate a dialogue between Abacha and Abiola. His refusal to support Abiola angered many Yoruba and Obasanjo's property in Yorubaland was attacked. Obasanjo was upset by what he saw as punishment for not backing Yoruba sectarian interests. \nIn March 1995, Obasanjo was in Denmark for a UN Summit on Social Development in Copenhagen. While there, he heard that Yar'Adua had been detained and that he would probably face the same fate if he returned to Nigeria. He nevertheless argued that he had done nothing wrong and thus agreed to return. Once at Lagos Airport, his passport was confiscated and the next day, police picked him up from his Ota home. The police accused Obasanjo of links to a coup against Abacha being plotted by Brigadier General Lawan Guadabe. Obasanjo was moved between various detention centres, while former US President Carter personally contacted Abacha requesting Obasanjo's release. Obasanjo was then returned to Ota, where he was placed under house arrest for two months, during which time he was denied access to media, the telephone, or visitors.\nAnother of those accused of being involved in the plot, Colonel Bello-Fadile, a military lawyer, had been tortured, during which he signed a statement that he had gone to Ota to inform Obasanjo about the coup as it was in preparation. This was used as evidence to charge Obasanjo with concealment of treason, a capital offense under Nigerian law. He was then taken to the State Security Interrogation Centre at Ikoyi. Abacha insisted that Obasanjo be tried before a military court, which took place on 19 June 1995. At the trial, Obasanjo denied that Bello-Fadile had ever met with him. Bello-Fadile also maintained that he had signed the statement implicating Obasanjo under duress, but the court rejected this retraction.\nOn 14 July, the court sentenced Obasanjo to 25 years in prison; Yar'Adua and fourteen others also accused of being part of the conspiracy were sentenced to death. Obasanjo later called it his \"saddest day\". After the US President Bill Clinton stated that his country would embargo Nigerian oil if these executions took place, Abacha commuted their sentences to imprisonment and reduced Obasanjo's sentence to 15 years.\nImprisonment: 1995\u20131998.\nObasanjo spent the next four months at the Ikoyi Centre, where he was initially chained up in solitary confinement. He was then transferred to Lagos' main prison, Kirikiri, where he spent time in the prison hospital for his hypertension and diabetes. Conditions in Kirikiri were overcrowded and unsanitary, with Obasanjo stating that he \"would not wish it on my worst enemy\". There, Bello-Fadile apologised to Obasanjo for having implicated him, at which Obasanjo forgave him. A note written by Bello-Fadile explaining the situation was then smuggled out of the prison and published, helping to demonstrate Obasanjo's innocence. \nAfter several weeks, Obasanjo and the other alleged conspirators were moved to Jos prison in the central plateau,Plateau State where they spent several months. Obasanjo was initially given only the Bible and Quran to read, but gradually allowed a wider range of literature. Writing material was also granted to him, allowing him to correspond with various people and institutions, and eventually Stella was permitted to visit him once a month. Both Mandela and Pope John Paul II called for his release, with Indian and German foundations both awarding him international prizes. The Africa Leadership Forum produced two volumes of letters and essays written in his honour; the Forum itself had been forced to relocate to Accra in Ghana to avoid persecution from Abacha's government.\nIn early 1996, Obasanjo was moved from Jos to the more remote prison at Yola,Adamawa State. There, he was allowed to cultivate a garden. Obasanjo related that in prison he deepened his Christian faith and grew closer to God, becoming a born-again Christian. From that point, Christianity played a much larger role in his personal world-view. At Yola, he preached 28 weekly sermons after visiting ministers were temporarily banned. He wrote these sermons down, allowing them to be published when he was released. Obasanjo also tried to reform some of the younger prisoners, following up on their progress once he became a free man. Obasanjo feared that he would be poisoned, particularly amid public speculation that Yar'adua's death had been caused by deliberate poisoning.\nAbacha died suddenly in June 1998, after which the military commanders appointed Lieutenant General Abdulsalami Abubakar as his successor. A week later, Abubakar ordered Obasanjo's release, sending a plane to return him to Ota. Eager to return Nigeria to civilian rule, Abubakar dissolved the country\u2019s existing parties and institutions and announced a plan that would lead to a civilian president being installed in May 1999.\nCampaigning for the presidency: 1998\u20131999.\nNow a free man, Obasanjo travelled to South Africa, the United Kingdom, and the United States, where he underwent medical treatment. New political parties were forming across Nigeria, one of the largest of which was the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), an umbrella group that sought to be sufficiently broad that if in power it would deter future coups. Prominent PDP members proposed Obasanjo as an ideal presidential candidate. They felt that he could command international respect and that as a military figure he could hold the country together against future coups and secessionist movements. They also argued that Nigeria needed a southern president to balance out its previous northern leadership and that Obasanjo had proved himself as a southerner who had no partisan prejudice against the north. \nFriends and family urged him not to run, saying that he would damage his good reputation or be killed. Obasanjo appeared reluctant, but on 28 October he joined the PDP and a week later announced that he was putting himself forward to be the party\u2019s presidential nominee. In his campaign, he emphasized his desire to restore what he deemed the legacy of good governance when he left office in 1979. At a fundraising dinner, he gained N356 million, of which N120 million had been donated by industrialist Aliko Dangote. Most of these donations came from military men and the new business class. He toured the country, giving speeches and seeking audiences with influential persons; courting state governors was a significant element of his approach. His campaign overshadowed that of his main rival, Alex Ekwueme, who was widely mistrusted by northerners and the military.\nThe PDP was gaining ground in Nigeria, proving the most successful party in the local government elections of December 1998, the state elections in January 1999, and the Senate and House of Representatives elections in February 1999. On 14 February 1999, a PDP convention was called to select its presidential candidate. Obasanjo received 1,658 votes, to 521 for Ekwueme, and 260 for the other five candidates. Seeking a northerner as the PDP\u2019s vice presidential candidate, Obasanjo selected Atiku Abubakar. The presidential election took place on 27 February; Obasanjo\u2019s sole opponent was the APP\u2019s Olu Falae. About a quarter of those eligible to vote did so, and there was some rigging although no violence. The official tally gave Obasanjo 63 percent of the vote; he was the loser in all six states of his native Yorubaland.\nPresidency (1999\u20132007).\nFirst term.\nAfter having it exorcised, Obasanjo moved into the presidential complex at Aso Rock in May. On 29 May he took the presidential oath in Abuja's Eagle Square. While appointing his new government, he selected an even number of ministers from the north and south of Nigeria, although the fact that a majority were Christian upset some Muslim northerners. Critics generally characterised Obasanjo's cabinet as being too old and conservative, as well as lacking in experience, especially when dealing with economic matters. During his first administration the levels of freedom experienced by Nigerians increased; freedom of the press allowed for considerable criticism of the president.\nIn the initial months of his presidency, Obasanjo retired around 200 military officers, including all 93 who held political positions, thus making a coup by experienced officers less likely. He also moved the Defence Ministry from Lagos to Abuja, ensuring it was brought under more direct government control.\nSecond term.\nObasanjo was re-elected in a tumultuous 2003 election that had violent ethnic and religious overtones. His main opponent, fellow former military ruler General Muhammadu Buhari, was Muslim and drew his support mainly from the north. Capturing 61.8% of the vote, Obasanjo defeated Buhari by more than 11\u00a0million votes.\nIn November 2003, Obasanjo was criticized for his decision to grant asylum to the deposed Liberian president, Charles Taylor. On 12 June 2006, he signed the Greentree Agreement with Cameroonian President Paul Biya which formally put an end to the Bakassi peninsula border dispute. Even though the Nigerian Senate passed a resolution declaring that the withdrawal of Nigerian troops from the Bakassi Peninsula was illegal, Obasanjo gave the order for it to continue as planned. \nIn his second term, Obasanjo continued to ensure the expansion of the country's police force, which rose to 325,000 in 2007.\nOngoing rural violence between Muslims and Christians in Plateau State led Obasanjo to declare a state of emergency there in May 2004, suspending the state government and installing six months of military rule. On 22 August 2005, the then governor of Abia State, Orji Uzor Kalu, submitted a petition alleging corrupt practices against Obasanjo to the EFCC.\nThird term agenda.\nObasanjo was embroiled in controversy regarding his \"Third Term Agenda,\" a plan to modify the constitution so he could serve a third, four-year term as president. This led to a political media uproar in Nigeria and the bill was not ratified by the National Assembly. Consequently, Obasanjo stepped down after the April 2007 general election. In an exclusive interview granted to Channels Television, Obasanjo denied involvement in what has been defined as \"Third Term Agenda\". He said that it was the National Assembly (Nigeria) that included tenure elongation amongst the other clauses of the Constitution of Nigeria that were to be amended. \"I never toyed with the idea of a third term,\" Obasanjo said.\nObasanjo was condemned by major political players during the Third Term Agenda saga. Senator Ken Nnamani, former President of the Nigerian Senate claimed Obasanjo informed him about the agenda shortly after he became President of the Nigerian Senate. \u201cImmediately, I became Senate President, he told me of his intentions and told me how he wanted to achieve it. I initially did not take him seriously until the events began to unfold.\u201d He also insinuated that Eight Billion Naira was spent to corrupt legislators to support the agenda. \u201cHow can someone talk like this that he didn\u2019t know about it, yet money, both in local and foreign currencies, exchanged hands,\u201d he asked. Femi Gbajabiamila corroborated Nnamani's account but put the figure differently, \u201cThe money totaled over N10 billion. How could N10bn be taken out of the national treasury for a project when you were the sitting President, yet that project was not your idea? Where did the money come from?\u201d In the following quotes, Nnamani said President George W. Bush warned Obasanjo to desist from his plan to contest presidential election for the third term: \u201cIf you want to be convinced that the man is only telling a lie, pick up a copy of the book written by Condoleza Rice, the former Secretary to the Government of the United States of America. It is actually an autobiography by Rice. On page 628 or page 638, she discussed Obasanjo\u2019s meeting with Bush, how he told the former American President that he wanted to see how he could amend the Constitution so that he could go for a third term. To his surprise, Bush told him not to try it. Bush told him to be patriotic and leave by May 29, 2007.\u201d\nEconomic, social and foreign policies.\nEconomic policy\nWith the oil revenue, Obasanjo created the Niger Delta Development Commission and implemented the Universal Basic Education Program to enhance the literacy level of Nigerians. He constituted both the Independent Corrupt Practices Commission and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission. Resuscitated the National Fertilizer Company in Kaduna and (Onne) Port Harcourt. Obasanjo increased the share of oil royalties and rents to the state of origin from 3 to 13 percent.\nBefore Obasanjo's administration, Nigeria's GDP growth had been painfully slow since 1987, and only managed 3 percent between 1999/2000. However, under Obasanjo, the growth rate doubled to 6 percent until he left office, helped in part by higher oil prices. Nigeria's foreign reserves rose from $2\u00a0billion in 1999 to $43\u00a0billion on leaving office in 2007. \nHe was able to secure debt pardons from the Paris and London club amounting to some $18\u00a0billion and paid another $18\u00a0billion to be debt free. Most of these loans were accumulated from short-term trade arrears during the exchange control period. (Point of correction). Most of these loans were accumulated not out of corruption but during a period 1982\u20131985 when Nigeria operated exchange control regime that vested all foreign exchange transactions on the central bank of Nigeria. \nWhen Obasanjo took office, Nigeria's economy was in a poor state. Inflation had averaged about 30% a year throughout the 1990s, and by 2001 around 20% of Nigerian adults were unemployed. Poverty was widespread, with Obasanjo's government seeking to alleviate this by paying N3,500 a month to around 200,000 people to conduct routine tasks such as sweeping and mending roads. This project was then replaced with a National Poverty Eradication Programme which focused on generating youth employment, rural infrastructure, and conservation. In 2000, Obasanjo's government doubled the legal minimum wage. \nHe invited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to review Nigeria's economy and offer advice on how to improve it; they warned that the government was overspending. In 2001, Obasanjo declared himself \"a believer in market efficiency\" and related that he had seen the damage caused by \"public sector mismanagement\" first hand. However, while expressing his commitment to the Washington Consensus of free markets, privatisation, and limited state expenditure, government expenditure as a share of GDP rose from 29% in 1997 to 50% in 2001. In January 2000, Nigeria received a US$1 billion stand-by loan, which allowed the government to enter debt rescheduling negotiations with its creditors. Obasanjo's government benefited from high international oil prices during his first presidential term. It planned both to increase Nigeria's oil output and to produce increasing quantities of liquefied natural gas, which was first exported from the country in 1999.\nObasanjo was determined to abolish the petrol subsidy, increasing prices to commercial rates. The Nigerian Labour Congress called a general strike in protest for June 2000 and Obasanjo ultimately compromised, reducing the subsidy rather than abolishing it. This situation allowed Obasanjo to be portrayed as an \"enemy of the poor\" on the public imagination. To further reduce expenditure, Obasanjo turned to privatisation, forming a National Council on Privatisation in July 1999. When he took office, Nigeria's federal government owned 588 public enterprises, accounting for over 55% of external debt, and Obasanjo hoped that many of these, although not those involved in oil production, could be sold off. Privatisation was not popular with Nigeria's population, having only 35% support according to a 2000 opinion survey. Obasanjo was also keen to negotiate debt reduction. He insisted that Nigeria's debts were so large as to be unpayable and that they threatened its economy and democracy. Although Canada, Italy, and the U.S. cancelled Nigeria's debts, these were small, and the country's major creditors, the largest of which was the UK, refused.\nObasanjo blamed many of Nigeria's economic problems on endemic corruption; in 2000, Transparency International ranked it the world\u2019s most corrupt country. Several days after taking office he presented an Anti-Corruption Bill to the National Assembly, although this aroused much opposition from critics who thought it gave the government excessive powers. Compromises were reached that watered-down Obasanjo's proposals, allowing him to sign the new law in June 2000. There is no evidence that corruption declined in Nigeria in Obasanjo's first term, and his government did nothing to check Nigeria's endemic low-level corruption, which was widespread at the state and local government levels. \nPublic health was also a key issue in Nigeria. During the 1990s, Nigeria had spent about 0.2% of its GDP on public health services, the joint lowest percentage in the world. Obasanjo\u2019s government increased this to over 0.4%. The most urgent health crisis impacting Nigeria was the HIV/AIDS epidemic, with Obasanjo immediately ordering a situation report on the topic after taking office. He then established a Presidential Committee on AIDS, which he headed as chair, and created a National Action Plan Committee to prepare a campaign for 2000\u201303 which would focus on publicity, training, counselling, and testing to combat the virus. To advance public health more broadly, he launched a new primary care campaign that used local government funds to try and build a clinic in every one of Nigeria\u2019s 774 local government areas.\nForeign policy\nOne of Obasanjo's major tasks, in which he succeeded, was to improve Nigeria's international reputation, which had been tarnished under Abacha. He spent over a quarter of his first term abroad, having visited 92 countries by October 2002. In October 1999, Obasanjo launched a South African-Nigerian Bi-National Commission to discuss cooperation between the two countries, the largest powers on Sub-Saharan Africa. Obasanjo retained Nigeria's close ties with the U.S., bringing in U.S. advisers to help train the Nigerian military. He had close ties with U.S. President Bill Clinton and also got on with Clinton's successor George W. Bush; Bush visited Abuja in 2000, and Obasanjo visited Washington DC in 2006. Pursuing warmer relations with the U.K. than he had in the 1970s, he attended his first Commonwealth Conference in November 1999 and hosted that in December 2003, where he received an honorary knighthood from British Queen Elizabeth II.\nOn taking office, Obasanjo had vowed to withdraw Nigerian troops from Sierra Leone. In August 1999 he announced a schedule for their withdrawal, although this was suspended while a UN peacekeeping force was assembled, to which Nigeria provided 4000 troops. This force withdrew in 2005. Amid turmoil in Liberia, Obasanjo ordered Nigerian troops into the country in August 2003; they passed into a UN command two months later. Obasanjo granted Liberia's ousted leader Charles Taylor refuge in Nigeria, although subsequently returned him to Liberia to face trial for war crimes at the request of new Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf. Eager to keep Nigeria out of domestically unpopular conflicts, he refused requests for the Nigerian military to participate in an ECOMOG intervention in the Guinea-Bissau civil war and the 2002 peacekeeping mission to the Cote d'Ivoire. At the UK's request, he assisted in a mediation with Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe government over the latter\u2019s encouragement of the violent seizure of white-owned farms. Along with South African President Thabo Mbeki and Australian Prime Minister John Howard, he was part of a team tasked with dealing with Zimbabwe by the Commonwealth. Obasanjo and Mbeki visited Zimbabwe three times to work on quiet diplomacy, unsuccessfully urging Mugabe to either retire or form a power sharing government with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change.\nConfronting ethnic and religious tensions\nShortly after Obasanjo's election, the place of Islamic sharia law became a major debate in Nigerian politics. Since the country's independence, sharia had been restricted to civil cases between Muslims in the northern states; criminal cases were not governed by sharia law, something that offended some Muslims. In September 1999, the Governor of Zamfara State, Ahmed Sani, announced the full introduction of sharia as the basis of that state's penal code, although specified that it would only apply to Muslim residents and not the non-Islamic minority. This sparked alarm among Christian minorities across northern Nigeria, with protests and counter-protests generating violence, especially in Kaduna. Across Nigeria, Christian opinion was very hostile to the introduction of sharia as the basis of state penal systems. Both houses of the National Assembly urged Obasanjo to take the issue to the Supreme Court. He was eager to avoid this, not wanting the role of sharia to become a constitutional issue. Publicly he sought to distinguish what he called \"genuine sharia\" from \"political sharia,\" praising the former while insisting that the latter was a fad that would fizzle out. By refusing to intervene, Obasanjo drew criticism for a lack of courage from many southerners, while Muslim hardliners in the north mocked him. Amid popular demand from Muslim communities, four more northern states adopted sharia penal law in 2000 and seven more in 2001. Obasanjo later stated that the issue was the biggest challenge he ever faced as President.When Obasanjo came to power, he was appalled that Nigeria was experiencing widespread unrest and violence, resulting in thousands of deaths. This violence was being exacerbated by a rapidly growing population which brought with it spiralling urbanisation and competition for scarce land in rural areas. To deal with this, Obasanjo doubled the country's police force from 120,000 to 240,000 between 1999 and 2003. Little was done to deal with police brutality, with the torture of suspects remaining widespread under Obasanjo's administration. Also fuelling the violence were ethnic tensions, with different ethnic and regional groups calling for greater autonomy, leading various commentators to predict the breakup of Nigeria. For Obasanjo, keeping the country united became a major priority. Only on select occasions would he turn to the military to quell unrest, preferring not to have to mobilise the army unless state governors requested it. In his words, \"we must utilise military force only when all else has failed. That is my own principle and philosophy.\" He saw greater value in forgiveness, amnesty, and reconciliation to achieve harmony than in retributive criminal justice of perpetrators. Under Obasanjo's presidency, the levels of violence and disorder in Nigeria declined.\nA major hub of secessionist sentiment was in the Niger Delta region, where indigenous groups wanted to retain a far greater proportion of the proceeds from the area's lucrative oil reserves. In July 1999, Obasanjo sent the National Assembly a bill to create a Niger Delta Development Commission to formulate and implement a plan for dealing with the region, something he hoped would quell violence there. Amid much debate, the Commission was finally launched in December 2000. In November 1999 he also sent two army battalions into the Niger Delta region to apprehend the Asawana Boys, an Ijaw group who had captured and killed police officers in Odi, Bayelsa State. The military destroyed most of the town; the government claimed that 43 had been killed, but a local NGO put the number of civilian deaths at 2,483. Obasanjo described the destruction as \"avoidable\" and \"regrettable\" and visited Odi in March 2001; he refused to condemn the army, apologise for the destruction, pay compensation or rebuild the town, although the Niger Delta Development Commission did the latter. \nIn 2000, Obasanjo banned the Oodua Peoples Congress (OPC), a Yoruba nationalist group involved in violence against other ethnicities, and ordered the arrest of its leaders. In September 2001, violence between indigenous Christians and northern Muslim traders in Plateau State resulted in around 500 deaths before the army moved in and regained control. Obasanjo then visited and urged reconciliation. In October 2001, Muslim demonstrators in Kano killed around 200 Igbo in response to Nigeria's support for the U.S. bombing of Afghanistan. Obasanjo then visited to urge reconciliation but was booed by residents. Also in October, soldiers had been sent to calm tensions between the Jukun and Tiv communities along the borders between Benue and Taraba states; a Tiv militia then captured and killed them in Zaki-Biam. Obasanjo ordered the army in, where they rounded up and killed as many as 250 to 300 local men. Obasanjo visited the area in 2002 and apologised for the excessive use of force.\nIn January 2002, Obasanjo ordered the mobile police to break-up the Bakossi Boys, a vigilante group active primarily in Abia and Anambra states which was responsible for an estimated two thousand killings. He had hesitated doing so before due to the popular support that the group had accrued through fighting criminal gangs, but felt able to move against them after their popularity waned. That same month, an ammunition dump at the Ijeka barracks near Lagos exploded, potentially resulting in as many as a thousand deaths. Obasanjo visited immediately. Violent unrest had also continued in Lagos, and in February 2002, troops were sent into the city to restore stability. In April 2002, Obasanjo proposed legislation that would allow for the proscription of ethnic-based groups if they were deemed to promote violence, but the National Executive rejected this as an overreach of presidential power.\nSome public officials like the Speaker of the House of Representatives and President of the Senate were involved in conflicts with the President, who battled many impeachment attempts from both houses. Obasanjo managed to survive impeachment and was renominated.\nPost-presidency (2007\u2013present).\nPolitics.\nHe became chairman of the PDP Board of Trustees, with control over nominations for governmental positions and even policy and strategy. As one Western diplomat said, \"He intends to sit in the passenger seat giving advice and ready to grab the wheel if Nigeria goes off course.\" He voluntarily resigned as the chairman board of trustees of the PDP in April 2012. Afterwards, he withdrew from political activities with PDP.\nIn March 2008, Obasanjo was \"supposedly\" indicted by a committee of the Nigerian parliament for awarding $2.2bn-worth of energy contracts during his eight-year rule, without due process. The report of this probe was never accepted by the whole Nigerian parliament due to manipulation of the entire process by the leadership of the power probe committee. It is not on any official record that Chief Obasanjo was indicted.\nIn May 2014, Obasanjo wrote to President Goodluck Jonathan requesting that he should mediate on behalf of the Nigerian government for the release of the Chibok girls held by the Boko Haram militants.\nOn 16 February 2015, he quit the ruling party and directed a PDP ward leader to tear his membership card during a press conference. He was later to be known as the navigator of the newly formed opposition party, the APC.\nOn 24 January 2018, he wrote serving President Muhammadu Buhari highlighting his areas of weakness and advising him not to run for office in 2019. To date all his letters to incumbent presidents have preceded their downfall.\nOn 31 January 2018, his political movement called \"Coalition for Nigeria Movement\" (CNM) was launched in Abuja. On 10 May 2018, the movement adopts a political party, African Democratic Congress (ADC), to realise its dream of a new Nigeria.\nOn 20 November 2018, he officially announced his return to the main opposition party, Peoples Democratic Party, PDP during a book launch \u201cMy Transition Hours,\u201d written by former President Goodluck Jonathan.\nOn the 22nd of January 2022, he declared that he has retired from partisan politics, he stated this after receiving National delegates of the People's Democratic Party [PDP] in his residence in Ota, Ogun State, Nigeria\nDiplomacy.\nObasanjo was appointed Special Envoy by UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon to the war-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo. He held separate meetings with DRC President Joseph Kabila and rebel leader Laurent Nkunda.\nDuring the Zimbabwean election of July 2013, Obasanjo headed a delegation of African Union election observers.\nFurther education.\nIn December 2017, Obasanjo defended his Ph.D thesis at the National Open University of Nigeria (NOUN). He now holds a Ph.D in Theology. That was about two years after he completed his master's degree in the same course.\nPolitical ideology.\nIdeologically, Obasanjo was a Nigerian nationalist. He was committed to a form of Nigerian patriotism and the belief that Nigeria should be retained as a single nation-state, rather than being broken up along ethnic lines. In 2001, he stated that his long-term goal was \"the nullification of all forms of identification except Nigerian citizenship\". He argued that dismantling Nigeria along ethnic lines would result in the ethnic cleansing and violence that had been seen during the Yugoslav Wars of the 1990s. Ilife argued that Obasanjo's Nigerian nationalism was impacted both by his detachment from the Yoruba elite and by his time in the army, where he worked alongside soldiers from a broad range of ethnic backgrounds. \nIliffe noted that an emphasis on consensus politics was \"a guiding principle\" throughout Obasanjo's career. While in power during the 1970s, Obasanjo expressed criticism of \"institutionalized opposition\" to the government. In his view this was \"profoundly incongruent with most African political culture and practice.\" Instead of constantly opposing the government, he believed that opposition parties should instead offer constructive criticism, and that politicians should pursue a search for consensus rather than engaging in constant competition. He thought that political competition had a destabilising effect that was particularly dangerous for a developing country such as Nigeria, and that stability should be preserved.\nFrustrated with what he regarded as the failures of representative democratic rule during the early 1980s, Obasanjo began expressing support for a one-party state in Nigeria. He nevertheless insisted that this one-party state must facilitate general public participation in governance, respect human rights, and protect freedom of expression. Later in the 1980s he warned against the proposed two-party state which Babangida was putting forward, believing that while Babangida envisioned a centre-left and centre-right party competing against each other, it would inevitably develop into one party representing the Christian south and the other representing the Muslim north. He instead argued that there should be no limit on the number of political parties that could be formed, although suggested that if this could not occur then Nigeria should become a one-party state. Amid the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s and the subsequent move towards multi-party politics across Africa, Obasanjo again became supportive of multi-party systems.\nIliffe noted that as a politician, Obasanjo displayed an \"open-minded pragmatism\". A tactic employed by Obasanjo at various points was to deliberately polarise an issue so as to rally support for his perspective.\nIliffe thought that although Obasanjo had been too young to play a major role in the anti-colonialist struggle for Nigerian independence from British rule, he was \"marked for ever\" by the \"optimism and dedication\" of the independence movement.\nIn office, Obasanjo's task was to ensure that Nigeria functioned both politically and economically. Over the course of his political career, Obasanjo moved from the belief in the advantages of state involvement in heavy industry, which was common in the 1970s, to a commitment to market liberalism that had become dominant in the 1990s. Iliffe thought that throughout his career, Obasanjo had always displayed an \"ambivalence\" about the level of state involvement in the economy. His general attitude was that poverty was caused by idleness. While campaigning for the 1999 presidential election, Obasanjo called himself a \"market-oriented social democrat\" although was vague on his proposed economic strategy. During his presidency, his government brought together figures who were committed to free markets, who favoured more protectionist economic strategies, and those sympathetic to socialism. Obasanjo was contemptuous of ideological arguments about capitalism and socialism. The decisions he took were usually based on political considerations rather than on legal or constitutional principles, something which was a source of concern for some of his critics. Erfler thought that during his first term in office, Obasanjo was a \"cautious reformer\".\nPersonal life.\nObasanjo lived a polygamous lifestyle. Obasanjo married his first wife, Oluremi Akinlawon, in London in 1963; she gave birth to his first child, Iyabo, in 1967. Iyabo had a close relationship with her father. Oluremi was unhappy that Obasanjo maintained relationships with other women and alleged that he beat her. They divorced in the mid 1970s. That decade, Obasanjo began a common-law relationship with NTA reporter Gold Oruh who bore him two children. He married his second wife, Stella Abebe, in 1976, having met her on a visit to London. He married Stella in 1976, and she bore him three children. Obasanjo's other partners include businesswoman Lynda Soares who was murdered by car thieves in 1986. On 23 October 2005, the President lost his wife, Stella Obasanjo, First Lady of Nigeria the day after she had an abdominoplasty in Spain. In 2009, the doctor, known only as 'AM', was sentenced to one year in jail for negligence in Spain and ordered to pay restitution to her son of about $176,000. He was largely private about his relationships with these women. Some of his children were resentful that he gave them no special privileges and treated their mothers poorly.\nEthnically, Obasanjo is Yoruba, a cultural identification he reflected in his speech and choice of clothing. However, he always foregrounded his Nigerian identity above his Yoruba one, repeatedly stating that \"I am a Nigerian who happens to be a Yoruba man. I am not a Yoruba man who happens to be a Nigerian.\"\nThroughout his life he expressed a preference for rural over urban life. He has been a lifelong teetotaller. He has been characterised as having a sense of discipline and duty, and emphasised what he saw as the importance of leadership. He was meticulous at planning, and Iliffe called him an \"instinctively cautious man\". Obasanjo always emphasised the importance of deferring to seniority, a value he had learned in childhood.\nIliffe described Obasanjo as a man with \"great physical and intellectual energy\" who \"exercised power with skill and ruthlessness, sometimes unscrupulously but seldom cruelly\". Erfler similarly stated that, although Obasanjo could appear \"boorish and dull\", he had a \"sharply perceptive mind\" and the capacity to be \"tough and ruthless\". He had, according to Iliffe, a \"remarkable capacity for work\". He was cautious with money, living modestly and seeking financial security by investing in property. He is softly-spoken.\nIn his sixties, Obasanjo would regularly work 18 to 20 hour days, getting very little sleep. He would start each day with prayers. Obasanjo suffers from diabetes and high blood-pressure. He enjoyed playing squash.\nObasanjo's writings after his imprisonment reflected his commitment to Biblical literalism. He called the Darwinian theory of evolution a \"debasing, devaluing and dehumanising\" idea. After his release from prison his writings placed far less emphasis on traditional culture as a guide to morality, calling on fellow Nigerians to reject much of their pre-Christian \"way of life.\" Iliffe noted that Obasanjo's born-again Christianity was \"strikingly orthodox\" and was aligned with mainline Baptist teaching. He rejected the prosperity gospel that was taught by some Pentecostalists in Nigeria. Providentialism also became a key part of his worldview after his imprisonment.\nIn addition to a variety of other chieftaincy titles, Chief Obasanjo is the holder of the title of the Olori Omo Ilu of Ibogun-Olaogun. A number of other members of his family hold or have held chieftaincies as well.\nReception and legacy.\nJohn Iliffe described Obasanjo as \"the outstanding member of the second generation of independent African leaders who dedicated themselves to the consolidation of their postcolonial states\". He thought that there were four major achievements of Obasanjo's presidency: that he partially contained the domestic turmoil permeating Nigeria, that he kept control of the military, that he helped to form the African Union, and that he liquidated the country's external debt. \nIn December 1999, his approval rating was at 84%; by 2001 it was at 72%; and by September 2003 it had fallen to 39%.\nObasanjo was repeatedly accused of corruption throughout his career, although maintained that his dealings were honest.\nObasanjo's critics believed that after his imprisonment in the 1990s, he increasingly perceived himself as a messianic figure, having lost his humility and become increasingly committed to the belief that it was his God-commanded destiny to rule Nigeria. Obasanjo's critics believed that he had been corrupted by power and that, particularly during his second term in office, he became driven by the idea of indefinitely retaining power for himself.\nDuring his first term as head of state he earned some enmity from fellow Yoruba who believed that he should have done more to advance the interests of his own ethnic group in government.\nAfter his imprisonment, Obasanjo claimed that criticism only served to confirm \"the rightness of my cause\" and demonstrated his critics' \"depravity in a fallen and perverted world.\"\n \n "}

He was widely credited with shifting the one-party state into a competitive two-party state. He advocated the movement of conservatives from the Democratic Party \u2013 which they deemed too liberal \u2013 to the Republican Party. The Helms-controlled National Congressional Club's state-of-the-art direct mail operation raised millions of dollars for Helms and other conservative candidates, allowing Helms to outspend his opponents in most of his campaigns. Helms was the most stridently conservative politician of the post-1960s era, especially in opposition to federal intervention into what he considered state affairs (including legislating integration via the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and enforcing suffrage through the Voting Rights Act of 1965).\nAs chairman of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he demanded a staunchly anti-communist foreign policy that would reward America's friends abroad, and punish its enemies. His relations with the State Department were often acrimonious, and he blocked numerous presidential appointees.\nIn domestic affairs, Helms promoted industrial development in the South, seeking low taxes and few labor unions so as to attract Northern and international corporations to relocate to North Carolina. On social issues, Helms was conservative. He was a master obstructionist who relished his nickname, \"Senator No\". He combined cultural, social and economic conservatism, which often helped his legislation win wide public support. He fought what he considered to be liberalism by opposing civil rights, disability rights, feminism, gay rights, affirmative action, access to abortions, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), and the National Endowment for the Arts. Helms brought an \"aggressiveness\" to his conservatism, as in his rhetoric against homosexuality. \"The Almanac of American Politics\" once wrote that \"no American politician is more controversial, beloved in some quarters and hated in others, than Jesse Helms\".\nChildhood and education (1921\u20131940).\nHelms was born in 1921 in Monroe, North Carolina, where his father, nicknamed \"Big Jesse\", served as both fire chief and chief of police; his mother, Ethel Mae Helms, was a homemaker. Helms was of English ancestry on both sides. Helms described Monroe as a community surrounded by farmland and with a population of about three thousand where \"you knew just about everybody and just about everybody knew you.\" The Helms family was poor during the Great Depression, resulting in each of the children working from an early age. Helms acquired his first job sweeping floors at \"The Monroe Enquirer\" at age 9. The family attended services each Sunday at First Baptist, Helms later saying he would never forget being served chickens raised in the family's backyard by his mother, following their weekly services. He recalled initially being bothered by their chickens becoming their food, but abandoned this view to allow himself to concentrate on his mother's cooking. Helms recalled that his family rarely spoke about politics, reasoning that the political climate did not call for discussions as most of the people the family were acquainted with were members of the Democratic Party.\nLink described Helms's father as having a domineering influence on the child's development, describing the pair as being similar in having the traits of being extrovert, effusive, and enjoying the company of others while both favored constancy, loyalty, and respect for order. The elder Helms asserted to Jesse that ambition was good and accomplishments and achievements would come his way through following a strict work ethic. Years later, Helms retained fond memories of his father's involvement with his youth: \"I shall forever have wonderful memories of a caring, loving father who took the time to listen and to explain things to his wide-eyed son.\" In high school, Helms was voted \"Most Obnoxious\" in his senior yearbook.\nHelms briefly attended Wingate Junior College, now Wingate University, near Monroe, before leaving for Wake Forest College. He left Wingate after a year to begin a career as a journalist, working for the next eleven years as a newspaper and radio reporter, first as a sportswriter and news reporter for Raleigh's \"The News &amp; Observer\", and also as assistant city editor for \"The Raleigh Times\". Helms retained a positive view of Wingate into his later years, saying the school was filled with individuals that treated him with kindness and that he had made it an objective to repay the institution for what it had done for him. While attending Wake Forest, Helms left work early and ran a few blocks to catch a train every morning to ensure he was on time to his classes. Helms stated that his goal in attending was never to get a diploma but instead form the skills needed for forms of employment he was seeking at a time when he aspired to become a journalist.\nMarriage and family.\nHelms met Dorothy \"Dot\" Coble, editor of the society page at \"The News &amp; Observer\", and they married in 1942. Helms's first interest in politics came from conversations with his conservative father-in-law. In 1945, his and Dot's first child Jane was born.\nEarly career (1940\u20131972).\nHelms's first full-time job after college was as a sports reporter with \"The Raleigh Times\". During World War II, Helms served stateside as a recruiter in the United States Navy.\nAfter the war, he pursued his twin interests of journalism and Democratic Party politics. Helms became the city news editor of \"The Raleigh Times.\" He later became a radio and television newscaster and commentator for \"WRAL-TV\", where he hired Armistead Maupin as a reporter.\nEntry into politics.\nIn 1950, Helms played a critical role as campaign publicity director for Willis Smith in the U.S. Senate campaign against a prominent liberal, Frank Porter Graham. Smith (a conservative Democratic lawyer and former president of the American Bar Association) portrayed Graham, who supported school desegregation, as a \"dupe of communists\" and a proponent of the \"mingling of the races\". Smith's fliers said, \"Wake Up, White People\", in the campaign for the virtually all-white primaries. Blacks were still mostly disfranchised in the state, because its 1900 constitutional amendment had been passed by white Democrats with restrictive voter registration and electoral provisions that effectively and severely reduced their role in electoral politics.\nSmith won and hired Helms as his administrative assistant in Washington. In 1952, Helms worked on the presidential campaign of Georgia Senator Richard Russell, Jr. After Russell dropped out of the presidential race, Helms returned to working for Smith. When Smith died in 1953, Helms returned to Raleigh.\nFrom 1953 to 1960, Helms was executive director of the North Carolina Bankers Association. He and his wife set up their home on Caswell Street in the Hayes Barton Historic District, where he lived the rest of his life.\nIn 1957, Helms as a Democrat won his first election for a Raleigh City Council seat. He served two terms and earned a reputation as a conservative gadfly who \"fought against everything from putting a median strip on Downtown Boulevard to an urban renewal project\". Helms disliked his tenure on the council, feeling all the other members acted as a private club and that Mayor William G. Enloe was a \"steamroller\". In 1960, Helms worked on the unsuccessful primary gubernatorial campaign of I. Beverly Lake, Sr., who ran on a platform of racial segregation. Lake lost to Terry Sanford, who ran as a racial moderate willing to implement the federal policy of school integration. Helms felt forced busing and forced racial integration caused animosity on both sides and \"proved to be unwise\".\nCapitol Broadcasting Company.\nIn 1960, Helms joined the Raleigh-based Capitol Broadcasting Company (CBC) as the executive vice-president, vice chairman of the board, and assistant chief executive officer. His daily CBC editorials on WRAL-TV, given at the end of each night's local news broadcast in Raleigh, made Helms famous as a conservative commentator throughout eastern North Carolina.\nHelms's editorials featured folksy anecdotes interwoven with conservative views against \"the civil rights movement, the liberal news media, and anti-war churches\", among many targets. He referred to \"The News and Observer\", his former employer, as the \"Nuisance and Disturber\" for its promotion of liberal views and support for African-American civil rights activities. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which had a reputation for liberalism, was also a frequent target of Helms's criticism. He is said to have referred to the university as \"The University of Negroes and Communists\" despite a lack of evidence, and suggested a wall be erected around the campus to prevent the university's liberal views from \"infecting\" the rest of the state. Helms said the civil rights movement was infested by Communists and \"moral degenerates\". He described the federal program of Medicaid as a \"step over into the swampy field of socialized medicine\".\nCommenting on the 1963 protests and March on Washington during the Civil Rights Movement, Helms stated, \"The negro cannot count forever on the kind of restraint that's thus far left him free to clog the streets, disrupt traffic, and interfere with other men's rights.\" He later wrote, \"Crime rates and irresponsibility among Negroes are facts of life which must be faced.\"\nHe was at Capitol Broadcasting Company until he filed for the Senate race in 1972.\nSenate campaign of 1972.\nHelms announced his candidacy for a seat in the United States Senate in 1972. His Republican primary campaign was managed by Thomas F. Ellis, who would later be instrumental in Ronald Reagan's 1976 campaign and also become the chair of the National Congressional Club. Helms took the Republican primary, winning 92,496 votes, or 60.1%, in a three-candidate field. Meanwhile, Democrats retired the ailing Senator B. Everett Jordan, who lost his primary to Congressman Nick Galifianakis. The latter represented the \"new politics\" of voters who included the young, African Americans voting since federal legislation removed discriminatory restrictions, and anti-establishment activists, who were based in and around the urban Research Triangle and Piedmont Triad. Although Galifianakis was a \"liberal\" by North Carolina standards, he opposed busing to achieve integration in schools.\nPolls put Galifianakis well ahead until late in the campaign, but Helms, facing all but certain defeat, hired a professional campaign manager, F. Clifton White, giving him dictatorial control over campaign strategy. While Galifianakis avoided mention of his party's presidential candidate, the liberal George McGovern, Helms employed the slogans \"McGovernGalifianakis \u2013 one and the same\", \"Vote for Jesse. Nixon Needs Him\" and \"Jesse: He's One of Us\", an implicit play suggesting his opponent's Greek heritage made him somehow less \"American\". Helms won the support of numerous Democrats, especially in the conservative eastern part of the state. Galifianakis tried to woo Republicans by noting that Helms had earlier criticized Nixon as being too left-wing.\nIn a taste of things to come, money poured into the race. Helms spent a record $654,000, much of it going toward carefully crafted television commercials portraying him as a soft-spoken mainstream conservative. In the final six weeks of the campaign, Helms outspent Galifianakis three-to-one. Though the year was marked by Democratic gains in the Senate, Helms won 54 percent of the vote to Galifianakis's 46 percent. He was elected as the first Republican senator from the state since 1903, before senators were directly elected, and when the Republican Party stood for a different tradition. Helms was helped by Richard Nixon's gigantic landslide victory in that year's presidential election; Nixon carried North Carolina by 40 points.\nFirst Senate term (1973\u201379).\nEntering the Senate.\nHelms quickly became a \"star\" of the conservative movement, and was particularly vociferous on the issue of abortion. In 1974, in the wake of the US Supreme Court's decision in \"Roe v. Wade\", Helms introduced a constitutional amendment that would have prohibited abortion in all circumstances, by conferring due process rights upon every fetus. However, the Senate hearing into the proposed amendments heard that neither Helms', nor James L. Buckley's similar amendment, would achieve their stated goal, and shelved them for the session. Both Helms and Buckley proposed amendments again in 1975, with Helms's amendment allowing states leeway in their implementation of an enshrined constitutional \"right to life\" from the \"moment of fertilization\".\nHelms was also a prominent advocate of free enterprise and favored cutting the budget. He was a strong advocate of a global return to the gold standard, which he would push at numerous points throughout his Senate career; in October 1977, Helms proposed a successful amendment that allowed United States citizens to sign contracts linked to gold, overturning a 44-year ban on gold-indexed contracts, reflecting fears of inflation. Helms supported the tobacco industry, which contributed more than 6% of the state's GSP until the 1990s (the highest in the country); he argued that federal price support programs should be maintained, as they did not constitute a subsidy but insurance. Helms offered an amendment that would have denied food stamps to strikers when the Senate approved increasing federal contributions to food stamp and school lunch programs in May 1974.\nIn 1973, the United States Congress passed the Helms Amendment to the Foreign Assistance Act. It states that, \"no foreign assistance funds may be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.\"\nIn January 1973, along with Democrats James Abourezk and Floyd Haskell, Helms was one of three senators to vote against the confirmation of Peter J. Brennan as United States Secretary of Labor.\nIn May 1974, when the Senate approved the establishment of no\u2010fault automobile insurance plans in every state, it rejected an amendment by Helms exempting states that were opposed to no\u2010fault insurance.\nForeign policy.\nFrom the start, Helms identified as a prominent anti-communist. He proposed an act in 1974 that authorized the President to grant honorary citizenship to Soviet dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. He remained close to Solzhenitsyn's cause, and linked his fight to that of freedom throughout the world. In 1975, as North Vietnamese forces approached Saigon, Helms was foremost among those urging the US to evacuate all Vietnamese demanding this, which he believed could be \"two million or more within seven days\". When the Senate Armed Services Committee voted to suppress a report critical of the US's strategic position in the arms race, Helms read the entire report out, requiring it to be published in full in the \"Congressional Record\".\nHelms was not at first a strong supporter of Israel; for instance, in 1973 he proposed a resolution demanding Israel return the West Bank to Jordan, and, in 1975, demanding that the Palestinian Arabs receive a \"just settlement of their grievances\". In 1977, Helms was the sole senator to vote against prohibiting American companies from joining the Arab League boycott of Israel, but that was primarily because the bill also relaxed discrimination against Communist countries. In 1982, Helms called for the US to break diplomatic relations with Israel during the 1982 Lebanon War. He favored prohibiting foreign aid to countries that had recently detonated nuclear weapons: this was aimed squarely at India, but it also affected Israel should it conduct a nuclear test. He worked to support the supply of arms to the United States' Arab allies under presidents Carter and Reagan, until his views on Israel shifted significantly in 1984.\nHelms and Bob Dole offered an amendment in 1973 that would have delayed cutting off funding for bombing in Cambodia if the President informed Congress that North Vietnam was not making an accounting \"to the best of its ability\" of US servicemen missing in Southeast Asia. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 56 to 25.\nNixon resignation.\nHelms delivered a Senate speech blaming liberal media for distorting Watergate and questioned if President Nixon had a constitutional right to be considered innocent until proven guilty following the April 1973 revelation of details relating to the scandal and Nixon administration aides resigning. He advocated against illegal activities being condoned with concurrent \"half-truth and allegations\" being reported by the media. Helms had four separate meetings with President Nixon in April and May 1973 where he attempted to cheer up the president and called for the White House to challenge its critics even as fellow Republicans from North Carolina criticized Nixon. Helms opposed the creation of the Senate Select Committee to Investigate Campaign Practices in the summer of 1973, even as it was chaired by fellow North Carolina Senator Sam Ervin, arguing that it was a ploy by Democrats to discredit and oust Nixon.\nIn August 1974, \"Newsweek\" published a list by the White House including Helms as one of thirty-six senators that the administration believed would support President Nixon in the event of his impeachment and being brought to trial by the Senate. The article stated that some supporters were not fully convinced and this would further peril the administration as 34 were needed to prevent conviction. Nixon resigned days later and kept contact with Helms during his post-presidency, calling Helms to either chat or offer advice.\n1976 presidential election.\nHelms supported Ronald Reagan for the presidential nomination in 1976, even before Reagan had announced his candidacy. His contribution was crucial in the North Carolina primary victory that paved the way for Reagan's presidential election in 1980. The support of Helms, alongside Raleigh-based campaign operative Thomas F. Ellis, was instrumental in Reagan's winning the North Carolina primary and later presenting a major challenge to incumbent President Gerald Ford at the 1976 Republican National Convention. According to author Craig Shirley, the two men deserve credit \"for breathing life into the dying Reagan campaign\". Going into the primary, Reagan had lost all the primaries, including in New Hampshire, where he had been favored, and was two million dollars in debt, with a growing number of Republican leaders calling for his exit. The Ford campaign was predicting a victory in North Carolina, but assessed Reagan's strength in the state simply: Helms's support. While Ford had the backing of Governor James Holshouser, the grassroots movement formed in North Carolina by Ellis and backed by Helms delivered an upset victory by 53% to 47%. The momentum generated in North Carolina carried Ronald Reagan to landslide primary wins in Texas, California, and other critical states, evening the contest between Reagan and Ford, and forcing undeclared delegates to choose at the 1976 convention.\nLater, Helms was not pleased by the announcement that Reagan, if nominated, would ask the 1976 Republican National Convention to make moderate Pennsylvania Senator Richard Schweiker his running mate for the general election, but kept his objections to himself at the time. According to Helms, after Reagan told him of the decision, Helms noted the hour because, \"I wanted to record for posterity the exact time I received the shock of my life.\" Helms and Strom Thurmond tried to make Reagan drop Schweiker for a conservative, perhaps either James Buckley or his brother William F. Buckley, Jr., and rumors surfaced that Helms might run for vice president himself, but Schweiker was kept. In the end, Reagan lost narrowly to Ford at the convention, while Helms received only token support for the Vice Presidential nomination, albeit enough to place him second, far behind Ford's choice of Bob Dole. The Convention adopted a broadly conservative platform, and the conservative faction came out acting like the winners; except Jesse Helms.\nHelms vowed to campaign actively for Ford across the South, regarding the conservative platform adopted at the convention to be a \"mandate\" on which Ford was pledging to run. However, he targeted Henry Kissinger after the latter issued a statement calling Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn a \"threat to world peace\", and Helms demanded that Kissinger embrace the platform or resign immediately. Helms continued to back Reagan, and the two remained close friends and political allies throughout Reagan's political career, although sometimes critical of each other. Despite Reagan's defeat at the convention, the intervention of Helms and Ellis arguably led to the most important conservative primary victory in the history of the Republican Party. This victory enabled Reagan to contest the 1976 Republican presidential nomination, and to win the next nomination at the 1980 Republican National Convention and ultimately the presidency of the United States.\nAccording to Craig Shirley,\nHad Reagan lost North Carolina, despite his public pronouncements, his revolutionary challenge to Ford, along with his political career, would have ended unceremoniously. He would have made a gracious exit speech, cut a deal with the Ford forces to eliminate his campaign debt, made a minor speech at the Kansas City Convention later that year, and returned to his ranch in Santa Barbara. He would probably have only reemerged to make speeches and cut radio commercials to supplement his income. And Reagan would have faded into political oblivion.\nTorrijos\u2013Carter treaties.\nHelms was a long-time opponent of transferring possession of the Panama Canal to Panama, calling its construction an \"historic American achievement\". He warned that it would fall into the hands of Omar Torrijos's \"communist friends\". The issue of transfer of the canal was debated in the 1976 presidential race, wherein then-President Ford suspended negotiations over the transfer of sovereignty to assuage conservative opposition. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter reopened negotiations, appointing Sol Linowitz as co-negotiator without Senate confirmation, and Helms and Strom Thurmond led the opposition to the transfer. Helms claimed that Linowitz's involvement with Marine Midland constituted a conflict of interests, arguing that it constituted a bailout of American banking interests. He filed two federal suits, demanding prior congressional approval of any treaty and then consent by both houses of Congress. Helms also rallied Reagan, telling him that negotiation over Panama would be a \"second Schweiker\" as far as his conservative base was concerned.\nWhen Carter announced, on August 10, 1977, the conclusion of the treaties, Helms declared it a constitutional crisis, cited the need for the support of United States' allies in Latin America, accused the U.S. of submitting to Panamanian blackmail, and complained that the decision threatened national security in the event of war in Europe. Helms threatened to obstruct Senate business, proposing 200 amendments to the revision of the United States criminal code, knowing that most Americans opposed the treaties and would punish congressmen who voted for them if the ratification vote came in the run-up to the election. Helms announced the results of an opinion poll showing 78% public opposition. However, Helms's and Thurmond's leadership of the opposition made it politically easier for Carter, causing them to be replaced by the soft-spoken Paul Laxalt.\n1978 re-election campaign.\nHelms began campaigning for re-election in February 1977, giving himself 15 months by the time of the primaries. While he faced no primary opponent, the Democrats nominated Commissioner of Insurance John Ingram, who came from behind in the first round of the primary to win in the run-off. Ingram was known as an eccentric populist and used low-budget campaigning, just as he had in winning the primary. He campaigned almost exclusively on the issue of insurance rates and against \"fat cats and special interests\", in which he included Helms. Helms was one of three senators given a 100% rating by the conservative Americans for Constitutional Action for 1977, and was ranked fourth-most conservative by others. The Democratic National Committee targeted Helms, as did President Carter, who visited North Carolina twice on Ingram's behalf.\nIn June 1978, along with Strom Thurmond, Helms was one of two senators named by an environmental group as part of a congressional \"Dirty Dozen\" that the group believed should be defeated in their re-election efforts due to their stances on environmental issues; membership on the list was based \"primarily on 14 Senate and 19 House votes, including amendments to air and water pollution control laws, strip\u2010mining controls, auto emissions and water projects\".\nOver the long campaign, Helms raised $7.5 million, more than twice as much as the second most-expensive nationwide (John Tower's in Texas), thanks to Richard Viguerie's and Alex Castellanos's pioneering direct mail strategies. It was estimated that at least $3 million of Helms's contributions were spent on fund-raising. Helms easily outspent Ingram several times over, as the latter spent $150,000. Due to a punctured lumbar disc, Helms was forced to suspend campaigning for six weeks in September and October. In a low-turnout election, Helms received 619,151 votes (54.5 percent) to Ingram's 516,663 (45.5 percent). Celebrating his victory, Helms told his supporters that it was a \"victory for the conservative and the free enterprise cause throughout America\", adding, \"I'm Senator No and I'm glad to be here!\"\nSecond Senate term (1979\u20131985).\nNew Senate term.\nOn January 3, 1979, the first day of the new Congress, Helms introduced a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion, on which he led the conservative Senators. Senator Helms was one of several Republican senators who in 1981 called into the White House to express his discontent over the nomination of Sandra Day O'Connor to the US Supreme Court; their opposition hinged over the issue of O'Connor's presumed unwillingness to overturn the \"Roe v. Wade\" ruling. Helms was also the Senate conservatives' leader on school prayer. An amendment proposed by Helms allowing voluntary prayer was passed by the Senate, but died in the House committee. To that act, Helms also proposed an amendment banning sex education without written parental consent. In 1979, Helms and Democrat Patrick Leahy supported a federal Taxpayer Bill of Rights.\nHe joined the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, being one of four men critical of Carter who were new to the committee. Leader of the pro-Taiwan congressional lobby, Helms demanded that the People's Republic of China reject the use of force against the Republic of China, but, much to his shock, the Carter administration did not ask them to rule it out.\nHelms also criticized the government over Zimbabwe Rhodesia, leading support for the Internal Settlement government under Abel Muzorewa, and campaigned along with Samuel Hayakawa for the immediate lifting of sanctions on Muzorewa's government. Helms complained that it was inconsistent to lift sanctions on Uganda immediately after Idi Amin's departure, but not Zimbabwe Rhodesia after Ian Smith's. Helms hosted Muzorewa when he visited Washington and met with Carter in July 1979. He sent two aides to the Lancaster House Conference because he did not \"trust the State Department on this issue\", thereby provoking British diplomatic complaints. His aide John Carbaugh was accused of encouraging Smith to \"hang on\" and take a harder line, implying that there was enough support in the US Senate to lift sanctions without a settlement. Helms introduced legislation that demanded immediate lifting of the sanctions; as negotiations progressed, Helms complied more with the administration's line, although Senator Ted Kennedy accused Carter of conceding the construction of a new aircraft carrier in return for Helms's acquiescence on Zimbabwe Rhodesia, which both parties denied. Helms's support for lifting sanctions on Zimbabwe Rhodesia may have been grounded in North Carolina's tobacco traders, who would have been the main group benefiting from unilaterally lifting sanctions on tobacco-exporting Zimbabwe Rhodesia.\n1980 presidential election.\nIn 1979, Helms was touted as a potential contender for the Republican nomination for the 1980 presidential election, but had poor voter recognition, and he lagged far behind the front-runners. He was the only candidate to file for the New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary. Going into 1980, he was suggested as a potential running mate for Reagan, and said he'd accept if he could \"be his own man\". He was one of three conservative candidates running for the nomination. However, his ideological agreement with Reagan risked losing moderates' votes, particularly due to the independent candidacy of Rep. John B. Anderson, and the Reagan camp was split: eventually designating George H. W. Bush as his preferred candidate. At the convention, Helms toyed with the idea of running for vice-president despite Reagan's choice, but let it go in exchange for Bush's endorsing the party platform and allowing Helms to address the convention. As expected, Helms was drafted by conservatives anyway, and won 54 votes, coming second. Helms was the \"spiritual leader of the conservative convention\", and led the movement that successfully reversed the Republican Party's 36-year platform support for an Equal Rights Amendment.\nIn the fall of 1980, Helms proposed another bill denying the Supreme Court jurisdiction over school prayer, but this found little support in committee. It was strongly opposed by mainline Protestant churches, and its counterpart was defeated in the House. Senators Helms and James A. McClure blocked Ted Kennedy's comprehensive criminal code that did not relax federal firearms restrictions, inserted capital punishment procedures, and reinstated current statutory law on pornography, prostitution, and drug possession. Following from his success at reintroducing gold-indexed contracts in 1977, in October 1980, Helms proposed a return to the gold standard, and successfully passed an amendment setting up a commission to look into gold-backed currency. After the presidential election, Helms and Strom Thurmond sponsored a Senate amendment to a Department of Justice appropriations bill denying the department the power to participate in busing, due to objections over federal involvement, but, although passed by Congress, was vetoed by a lame duck Carter. Helms pledged to introduce an even stronger anti-busing bill as soon as Reagan took office.\nRepublicans take the Senate.\nIn the 1980 Senate election, the Republicans unexpectedly won a majority, their first in twenty-six years, including John Porter East, a social conservative and a Helms prot\u00e9g\u00e9 soon dubbed \"Helms on Wheels\", winning the other North Carolina seat. Howard Baker was set to become Majority Leader, but conservatives, angered by Baker's support for the Panama treaty, SALT II, and the Equal Rights Amendment, had sought to replace him with Helms until Reagan gave Baker his backing. Although, it was thought they'd put Helms in charge of the Foreign Relations Committee instead of the liberal Charles H. Percy, he instead became chairman of the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee in the new Congress.\nThe first six months of 1981 were consumed by numerous Foreign Relations Committee confirmation hearings, which were held up by Helms, who believed many of the appointees too liberal or too tainted by association with Kissinger, and not dedicated enough to his definition of the \"Reagan program\": support for South Africa, Taiwan, and Latin American right-wing regimes (as opposed to Black Africa and \"Red\" China). These nominations included Alexander Haig, Chester Crocker, John J. Louis, Jr., and Lawrence Eagleburger, all of whom were confirmed regardless, while all of Helms's candidates were rejected. Helms also, unsuccessfully, opposed the nominations of Caspar Weinberger, Donald Regan, and Frank Carlucci. However, he did score a notable coup two years later when he led a small group of conservatives to block the nomination of Robert T. Grey for nine months, and thus causing the firing of Eugene V. Rostow.\nFood stamp program.\nAn opponent of the Food Stamp Program, Helms had already voted to reduce its scope, and was determined to follow this through as Agriculture Committee chairman. At one point, he proposed a 40% cut in their funding. Instead, Helms supported the replacement of food stamps with workfare. He then proposed that food stamp benefits be dropped by $11.50 per month per child for each youngster enrolled in the school lunch program. He maintained that \"free lunches\" duplicate food stamps. The outcry against his proposal was so strong that he was compelled to back down. Helms also challenged fraud in the food stamp program. He said that the public had \"grown legitimately resentful about the abuses which they themselves have observed\".\nAs a freshman lawmaker in 1973, Helms tried to reverse the 1968 congressional vote which had permitted workers on strike to qualify for food stamps. Though he failed to gain reversal, his position drew the support of future Minority and Majority Leader Howard Baker of Tennessee and twelve Senate Democrats. Helms's position was upheld in 1988, when the United States Supreme Court decreed 5\u20133 that a law denying food stamps to strikers was constitutional unless the worker otherwise qualified for food stamps before going on strike. Justice Byron White said that the government must maintain neutrality in labor dispute and not subsidize strikers.\nAs the Agriculture Committee chairman, Helms proposed repeal of the 1977 amendment which had deleted the purchase requirement for food stamps. With that position he ran afoul of fellow Republican Bob Dole, who claimed that the purchase requirement had contributed to fraud and administrative difficulties in the program. Helms cited a Congressional Budget Office report which showed that 75 percent of the increase in stamp usage had occurred since the purchase requirement was dropped. When Helms's ally, Steve Symms of Idaho, proposed to reinstitute the purchase requirement, the motion was defeated, 33\u201366.\nThe Helms bloc also failed to secure other limits to the program, including a motion to delete alcohol and drug residential treatment patients from benefits. House and Senate conferees dropped a Helms-backed provision requiring families disqualified from the program to repay double the amount of any benefits received improperly. House Democratic Whip Tom Foley of Washington insisted that such a penalty would violate the Fifth Amendment rights to due process. Instead families repay the actual amount of improperly obtained benefits.\nEconomic policies.\nHelms supported the gold standard through his role as the Agriculture Committee chairman, which exercises wide powers over commodity markets. During the budget crisis of 1981, Helms restored $200 million for school lunches by instead cutting foreign aid, and against increases in grain and milk price support, despite the importance of the dairy industry to North Carolina. He warned repeatedly against costly farm subsidies as chairman. However, in 1983, he used his position to lobby to use the country's strategic dairy and wheat stocks to subsidize food exports as part of a trade war with the European Union. Helms heavily opposed cutting food aid to Poland after martial law was declared, and called for the end of grain exports to (and arms limitation talks with) the Soviet Union instead.\nIn 1982, Helms authored a bill to introduce a federal flat tax of 10% with a personal allowance of $2,000. He voted against the 1983 budget: the only conservative Senator to have done so, and was a leading voice for a balanced budget amendment. With Charlie Rose, he proposed a bill that would limit tobacco price supports, but would allow the transfer of subsidy credits from non-farmers to farmers. He co-sponsored the bi-partisan move in 1982 to extend drug patent duration. Helms continued to pose obstacles to Reagan's budget plans. At the end of the 97th Congress, Helms led a filibuster against Reagan's increase of federal gasoline tax by 5-cents per gallon: mirroring his opposition to Governor Jim Hunt's 3-cent increase in the North Carolina gasoline tax, but alienating the White House from Helms.\nSocial issues.\nAlthough Helms recognized budget concerns and nominations as predominant, he rejected calls by Baker to move debate on social issues to 1982, with conservatives seeking to discuss abortion, school prayer, the minimum wage, and the \"fair housing\" policy. With the new Congress, Helms and Robert K. Dornan again proposed an amendment banning abortion in all circumstances, and also proposed a bill defining fetuses as human beings, thereby taking it out of the hands of the federal courts, along with Illinois Republican Henry Hyde and Kentucky Democrat Romano Mazzoli. More successfully, Helms passed an amendment banning federal funds from being used for abortion unless the woman's life is in danger. His support was key to the nomination of C. Everett Koop as Surgeon General, by proposing lifting the age limit that would otherwise have ruled out Koop. He proposed an amendment taking school prayer out of the remit of the Supreme Court, which was criticized for being unconstitutional; despite Reagan's endorsement, the bill was eventually rejected, after twenty months of dispute and numerous filibusters, in September 1982, by 51\u201348. Helms and Strom Thurmond sponsored another amendment to prevent the Department of Justice filing suits in defence of federal busing, which he contended wasted taxpayer money without improving education; this was filibustered by Lowell Weicker for eight months, but passed in March 1982. However, Democratic Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill blocked the measure from being considered by the House of Representatives.\nIn 1981, Helms started secret negotiations to end an 11-year impasse and pave the way for desegregation of historically white and historically black colleges in North Carolina. In response to a rival anti-discrimination bill in 1982, he proposed a bill outlawing granting tax-free status to schools that discriminated racially, but allowing schools that discriminate on the grounds of religion to avoid taxes. When the Voting Rights Act came up for amendment in 1982, Helms and Thurmond criticized it for bias against the South, arguing that it made Carolinians \"second-class citizens\" by treating their states differently, and proposed an amendment that extended its terms to the whole country, which they knew would bury it. However, it was extended anyway, despite Helms's filibuster, which he promised to lead \"until the cows come home\". In 1983, Helms hired Claude Allen, an African American, as his press secretary. Despite his publicly aired belief that he was one of the best-liked senators amongst black staff in Congress, it was pointed out that he did not have any African-American staff of his own, prompting the hiring of the twenty-two-year-old, who had switched parties when he was press secretary to Bill Cobey in the previous year's campaign.\nIn 1983, Helms led the 16-day filibuster in the Senate opposing the proposed establishment of Martin Luther King Day as a federal holiday. Helms and others claimed, \"another federal holiday would be costly for the economy.\" Although the Congressional Budget Office cited a cost of $18 million, Helms claimed it would cost $12 billion a year. Helms \"distributed a 300-page packet claiming that the civil rights leader was a political radical who adopted \"action-oriented Marxism\" and detailing Dr. King's supposed treachery\" in which he accused King of \"appear[ing] to have welcomed collaboration with Communists\", Stanley Levison and Jack O'Dell. Helms ended the filibuster in exchange for a new tobacco bill. President Reagan signed the bill on October 19, 1983. Helms then demanded that FBI surveillance tapes allegedly detailing philandering on King's part be released, although Reagan and the courts refused. The conservatives attempted to rename the day \"National Equality Day\" or \"National Civil Rights Day\", but failed, and the bill was passed. Writing in \"The Washington Post\" several years later, David Broder attributed Helms opposition to the MLK holiday to racism on Helms's part.\nLatin America.\nUpon the Republican takeover of the Senate, Helms became chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs, promising to \"review all our policies on Latin America\", of which he had been severely critical under Carter. He immediately focused on escalating aid to the Salvadoran government in its civil war, and particularly preventing Nicaraguan and Cuban support for guerrillas in El Salvador. Within hours, the subcommittee approved military aid to El Salvador, and later led the push to cut aid to Nicaragua. Helms was assisted in pursuing the foreign policy realignment by John Carbaugh, whose influence the \"New York Times\" reported \"[rivalled] many of [the Senate's] more visible elected members\".\nIn El Salvador, Helms had close ties with the right-wing Salvadoran Nationalist Republican Alliance and its leader and death squad founder Roberto D'Aubuisson. Helms opposed the appointment of Thomas R. Pickering as Ambassador to El Salvador. Helms alleged that the CIA had interfered in the Salvadoran election March and May 1984, in favor of the incumbent centre-left Jos\u00e9 Napole\u00f3n Duarte instead of D'Aubuisson, claiming that Pickering had \"used the cloak of diplomacy to strangle freedom in the night\". A CIA operative testifying to the Senate Intelligence Committee was alleged by Helms to have admitted rigging the election, but senators that attended have stated that, whilst the CIA operative admitted involvement, they did not make such an admission. Helms disclosed details of CIA financial support for Duarte, earning a rebuke from Barry Goldwater, but Helms replied that his information came from sources in El Salvador, not the Senate committee.\nIn 1982, Helms was the only senator who opposed a Senate resolution endorsing a pro-British policy during the Falklands War, citing the Monroe Doctrine, although he did manage to weaken the resolution's language. Nonetheless, Helms was a supporter of the Chilean dictator General Augusto Pinochet, who supported the United Kingdom in the Falklands conflict. Helms was steadfastly opposed to the Castro regime in Cuba, and spent much of his time campaigning against the lifting of sanctions. In 1980, he opposed a treaty with Cuba on sea boundary delimitation unless it included withdrawal of the Soviet brigade stationed on the island. The following year, he proposed legislation establishing Radio Free Cuba, which would later become known as Radio Mart\u00ed.\n1984 re-election campaign.\nHalfway through Reagan's term, Helms was talked about as a prospective presidential candidate in 1984 in case Reagan chose to stand down after his first term. There was also speculation that Helms would run for the Governorship, being vacated by Jim Hunt. However, the President stood for re-election, and Helms ran once more for his Senate seat\u2014facing Governor Hunt\u2014and becoming the top target amongst the incumbent Senate Republicans.\nUnlike in 1978, Helms faced an opponent in the primary, George Wimbish, but won with 90.6% of the vote, while Hunt received 77% in his. During the general election campaign, Hunt accused Helms of having the most \"anti-Israel record of any member of the U.S. Senate\". Helms pledged during the campaign that he would retain his chairmanship of the Agriculture committee.\nIn the most expensive Senate campaign up to that time, Helms narrowly defeated Hunt, taking 1,156,768 (51.7%) to Hunt's 1,070,488 (47.8%).\nThird Senate term (1985\u20131991).\nIn 1989, Helms hired James Meredith, most famous as the first African American ever admitted to the University of Mississippi, as a domestic policy adviser to his Senate office staff. Meredith noted that Helms was the only member of the Senate to respond to his offer.\nIn 1989, Helms successfully lobbied for an amendment to the Americans with Disabilities Act, legislation protecting disability rights that exempted pedophilia, schizophrenia, and kleptomania from the conditions against which discrimination was barred. Even though the Helms amendment was kept in the final ADA bill that passed Congress in 1990, Helms twice voted against the bill.\nForeign policy.\nAlthough Helms was returned to office, and became the senior Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana became its chair, after Helms and Lugar cut a deal to keep liberals out of top committee posts. Despite pressure to claim the Foreign Relations chair, Helms kept the Agriculture chair, as he had pledged in his campaign.\nA \"purge\" of the State Department by George P. Shultz in early 1985, replacing conservatives with moderates, was heavily opposed by the Helms-led conservatives. They unsuccessfully attempted to block the appointment of Rozanne L. Ridgway, Richard Burt, and Edwin G. Corr as ambassadors, arguing that Shultz was appointing diplomats that were not loyal to President Reagan's philosophy, particularly in Latin America. In August, Helms threatened to lead a filibuster against a bill imposing sanctions on South Africa, delaying it until after summer recess.\nIn early 1986, Panamanian dissident Winston Spadafora visited Helms and requested that the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere Affairs hold hearings on Panama. Ignoring Elliott Abrams' request for a softer line towards Panama, Helms\u2014a long-time critic of Noriega\u2014agreed, and the hearings uncovered the large degree of leeway that the U.S. government, and particularly the Central Intelligence Agency, had been giving to Noriega. After the Drug Enforcement Administration encountered opposition from Oliver North in investigating Noriega's role in drug trafficking, Helms teamed up with John Kerry to introduce an amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act demanding that the CIA investigate the Panama Defense Forces' potential involvement. In 1988, after Noriega was indicted on charges including drug trafficking, a former Panamanian consul general and chief of political intelligence testified to the subcommittee, detailing Panama's compiling of evidence on its political opponents in the United States, including Senators Helms and Ted Kennedy, with the assistance of the CIA and National Security Council. Helms proposed that the government suspend the Carter-Torrijos treaties unless Noriega were extradited within thirty days.\nIn July 1986, after Rodrigo Rojas DeNegri was burned alive during a street demonstration against the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet in Chile, Helms stated that DeNegri and his companion Carmen Quintana Arancibia were \"Communist terrorists\" that had earlier been sighted setting fire to a barricade. Helms also criticized United States Ambassador to Chile Harry G. Barnes Jr. for attending DeNegri's funeral, saying Barnes \"planted the American flag in the midst of a Communist activity\" and President Reagan would have sent him home were he there. The following month, the Justice Department disclosed information to Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that linked Helms and a sensitive intelligence matter of the Chile government. Helms responded to the disclosure by telling reporters that the Justice Department \"want to intimidate me and harass me, and it's not going to work\" and said that both the Justice Department and himself were aware he had \"violated no rules of classification\". In a letter to Attorney General Edwin Meese, Helms made a request of the Justice Department to investigate if he or members of his staff had been spied on during the Chile visit and called the charges against him \"frivolous and false indictment\".\nHelms became interested in the Vietnam War POW/MIA issue, and in October 1990 his committee staff chief and longest-serving aide, James P. Lucier, prepared a report stating that it was probable there were live American prisoners still being held in Vietnam and that the George H. W. Bush administration was complicit in hiding the facts. The report also alleged that the Soviet Union had held American prisoners after the end of World War II and more may have been transferred there during the Korean War and during the Vietnam War. (Lucier also believed that survivors of the 1983 shoot-down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 were being held prisoner by the Soviets.) Helms stated that the \"deeper story\" was a possible \"deliberate effort by certain people in the government to disregard all information or reports about living MIA-POWs\". This was followed up in May 1991 by a minority report of the Foreign Relations Committee, released by Helms and titled \"An Examination of US Policy Toward POW/MIAs\", which made similar claims and concluded that \"any evidence that suggested an MIA might be alive was uniformly and arbitrarily rejected ...\" The issuing of the report caused other Republicans on the committee to become angry, and charges were made that the report contained errors, innuendo, and unsubstantiated rumors. This and other personnel matters led to Helms firing Lucier and eight other staff members in January 1992. Helms subsequently distanced himself from the POW/MIA issue. (The aides claimed vindication later in 1992 when Russian President Boris Yeltsin said that the Soviet Union had kept some U.S. prisoners in the early 1950s.)\nHIV legislation.\nIn 1987, Helms added an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations Act, which directed the president to use executive authority to add HIV infection to the list of excludable diseases that prevent both travel and immigration to the United States. The action was opposed by the U.S. Public Health Service. Congress restored the executive authority to remove HIV from the list of excludable conditions in the 1990 Immigration Reform Act, and in January 1991, Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan announced he would delete HIV from the list of excludable conditions. A letter-writing campaign headed by Helms ultimately convinced President Bush not to lift the ban, and left the United States the only industrialized nation in the world to prohibit travel based on HIV status. The travel ban was also responsible for the cancellation of the 1992 International AIDS Conference in Boston. On January 5, 2010, the 22-year-old ban was lifted after having been signed by President Barack Obama on October 30, 2009.\n\"The New York Times\" stated that Helms was \"bitterly opposed\" to federal financing for research and treatment of AIDS, which he believed was God's punishment for homosexuals. He introduced an amendment to a 1987 spending bill that prohibited the use of federal tax dollars for any AIDS educational materials that would \"promote or encourage, directly or indirectly, homosexual activities\".\nOpposing the Kennedy-Hatch AIDS bill in 1988, Helms stated, \"There is not one single case of AIDS in this country that cannot be traced in origin to sodomy\". When Ryan White died in 1990, his mother went to Congress to speak to politicians on behalf of people with AIDS. She spoke to 23 representatives; Helms refused to speak to Jeanne White, even when she was alone with him in an elevator. Despite opposition by Helms, the Ryan White Care Act passed in 1990.\nIn 1988, Helms convinced congress to implement a ban on federal funding for needle exchange programs, arguing that spending federal money on such programs was tantamount to \"federal endorsement of drug abuse\".\n1990 re-election campaign.\nPrimary.\nHelms ran for re-election in a nationally publicized and rancorous campaign against the former mayor of Charlotte, Harvey Gantt, in his \"bid to become the nation's only black Senator\" and \"the first black elected to the Senate from the South since Reconstruction\". In the Republican primary, Helms had two opponents, George Wimbish (as in 1984) and another; Helms won with 84.3% of the vote.\nCampaign.\nDuring the campaign the North Carolina GOP and others mailed over 125,000 notices (almost exclusively to black voters) telling them that they were not eligible to vote and warned that if they went to the polls they could be prosecuted for voter fraud. At the behest of several civil rights groups and the Democratic National Party, the US Department of Justice sued the Helms campaign, the NC GOP, four lobbying firms and two individual lobbyists. Thomas Farr, campaign manager for Helms, disavowed any knowledge of the dirty tricks, which was shown to be false when his hand written notes were discovered. The affected parties acknowledged and agreed to the Justice Departments' ruling and were forced to desist from any other such activities.\nIn a close race, Helms also aired a late-running television commercial titled \"Hands\" that showed a white man's hands crumpling up a rejection notice from a company that gave the job to a \"less qualified minority\"; some critics claimed the ad utilized subtextual racist themes. The advertisement was produced by Alex Castellanos, whom Helms would employ until his company was dropped in April 1996 after running an unusually hard-hitting ad.\nAnother Helms television commercial accused Gantt of running a \"secret campaign\" in homosexual communities and of being committed to \"mandatory gay rights laws\" including \"requiring local schools to hire gay teachers\".\nOutcome.\nHelms won the election with 1,087,331 votes (52.5 percent) to Gantt's 981,573 (47.4 percent). In his victory statement, Helms noted the unhappiness of some media outlets over his victory, paraphrasing a line from \"Casey at the Bat\": \"There's no joy in Mudville tonight. The mighty ultra-liberal establishment, and the liberal politicians and editors and commentators and columnists have struck out.\"\nFourth Senate term (1991\u20131997).\nIn the early 1990s, Helms was a vocal opponent of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\nIn August 1991, Helms became one of six Republicans on the Select Senate Committee on POW-MIA Affairs that would investigate the number of Americans still missing in the aftermath of the Vietnam War following renewed interest.\nKeating Five investigation.\nOn August 5, 1991, Helms made public a special counsel report calling for California Senator Alan Cranston to be censured by the Senate on charges of reprehensible conduct. The document had been delivered to members of the Senate Ethics Committee the previous month. Helms stated that his move came from the belief that the release would cause the panel to act faster, additionally citing the panel members with being at odds on how much of the report should be released as a reason for not closing an inquiry into Charles H. Keating Jr. and his role in the savings and loan scandal of the late 1980s.\nThe Senate Ethics Committee subsequently voted to investigate Helms for releasing the confidential document. Helms issued a statement saying in part that it was \"a fascinating suggestion that I may have somehow violated some unspecified 'rule' when I released, over the weekend, my own signed report regarding the Keating Five investigation\". Helms welcomed the investigation into himself, along with one into the handling of the Keating Five case (five senators who received financial contributions from Keating Jr.) by the Senate Ethics Committee, calling the panel's investigation \"long, arduous and expensive\" and noting a potential public investigation \"may disclose that the committee labored and brought forth a mouse\".\nNational Endowment for the Arts.\nIn 1989, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded grants for a retrospective of Robert Mapplethorpe photographs, some of which containing homosexual themes, in addition to a museum in Winston-Salem, North Carolina supporting an exhibition that featured an image by Andres Serrano of a crucifix suspended in urine. These images caused an uproar and marked the National Endowment for the Arts becoming \"a favorite target for Mr. Helms and other conservative senators who have objected to the work of some of the artists who have received Government grants.\" In September 1989, Helms met with John E. Frohnmayer, President Bush's appointee for Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts. While both declined releasing details on the contents of the meeting, Helms was reported to have made it clear that he considered his opposition to the N.E.A. grants on certain imagery essential to his political capital and that the battle over what was considered appropriate for federal government funding had just begun.\nIn September 1991, Helms charged the National Endowment for the Arts with financing art that would turn \"the stomach of any normal person\" while proposing an amendment to an appropriations bill forbidding the usage of the grants for the N.E.A. in promoting material that would be deemed as depicting \"sexual or excretory activities or organs\" in an \"offensive way\". On September 20, the Senate voted 68 to 28 in favor of the amendment. The same night, Helms withdrew another amendment that changed the financing formula of the N.E.A. to funneling over half of its grant money through states as opposed to the Washington headquarters and would see a reduction in the New York fiscal year appropriation from its 26 million to just over 7 million.\nRemarks re Moseley Braun and Clinton.\nIn a widely publicized incident on July 22, 1993, Carol Moseley Braun, the first black woman in the Senate and the only black Senator at the time, reported that Helms deliberately sought to offend her by singing \"Dixie\" in her presence. After Moseley Braun persuaded the Senate to vote against Helms's amendment to extend the patent of the United Daughters of the Confederacy insignia, which included the Confederate flag, Mosely Braun claims that Helms ran into her in an elevator. Helms turned to Senator Orrin Hatch and said, \"Watch me make her cry. I'm going to make her cry. I'm going to sing 'Dixie' until she cries.\" He then proceeded to sing the song about \"the good life\" during slavery to Moseley Braun. In 1999, Helms unsuccessfully attempted to block Moseley Braun's nomination to be United States Ambassador to New Zealand.\nIn 1994, Helms created a sensation when he told broadcasters Rowland Evans and Robert Novak that Clinton was \"not up\" to the tasks of being commander-in-chief, and suggested two days later, on the anniversary of John F. Kennedy's assassination, \"Mr. Clinton better watch out if he comes down here. He'd better have a bodyguard.\" Helms said Clinton was unpopular and that he had not meant it as a threat. Clinton addressed the comments when asked about them by a reporter at a press conference the following day: \"I think the remarks were unwise and inappropriate. The President oversees the foreign policy of the United States. And the Republicans will decide in whom they will repose their trust and confidence; that's a decision for them to make, not for me.\"\nDuring this term, Helms was one of three senators to vote against the confirmation of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court.\nRepublican majority.\nRepublicans regained control of Congress after the 1994 elections and Helms finally became the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He was the first North Carolinian to chair the committee since Nathaniel Macon, a descendant of Martha Washington, in the first quarter of the 19th century. In that role, Helms pushed for reform of the UN and blocked payment of the United States' dues. Helms secured sufficient reforms that a colleague, future President Joe Biden of Delaware said that \"As only Nixon could go to China, only Helms could fix the U.N.\"\nHelms passed few laws of his own in part because of this bridge-burning style. Hedrick Smith's \"The Power Game\" depicts several senators specifically blocking Helms's goals as a result of his intransigence, but nonetheless portrays Helms as a \"devastatingly effective power broker\". Helms vehemently opposed granting most favored nation status to China, citing human rights concerns.\nHelms tried to block the refunding of the Ryan White Care Act in 1995, saying that those with AIDS were responsible for the disease, because they had contracted it because of their \"deliberate, disgusting, revolting conduct\", and that the reason AIDS existed in the first place was because it was \"God's punishment for homosexuals\". Helms also claimed that more federal dollars were spent on AIDS than heart disease or cancer, despite this not being borne out by the Public Health Service statistics.\nHelms\u2013Burton Act.\nSoon after becoming the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in February 1995, Helms announced that he wished to strengthen the spirit of the 1992 Torricelli Act with new legislation. Its companion sponsored through the House by Dan Burton of Indiana, it would strengthen the embargo against Cuba: further codifying the embargo, instructing United States diplomats to vote in favor of sanctions on Cuba, stripping the President of the option of ending the embargo by executive order until Fidel and Ra\u00fal Castro leave power and a prescribed course of transition is followed. The bill also, controversially explicitly overruling the Act of State Doctrine, allowed foreign companies to be sued in American courts if, in dealings with the regime of Fidel Castro, they acquired assets formerly owned by Americans.\nPassing the House comfortably, the Senate was far more cautious, under pressure from the Clinton administration. The debate was filibustered, with a motion of cloture falling four votes short. Helms reintroduced the bill without Titles III and IV, which detailed the penalties on investors, and it passed by 74 to 24 on October 19, 1995. A conference committee was scheduled to convene, but did not until February 28, 1996, by which time external events had taken over. On February 24, Cuba shot down two small Brothers to the Rescue planes piloted by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans. When the conference committee met, the tougher House version, with all four titles, won out on most substantive points. It was passed by the Senate 74\u201322 and the House 336\u201386, and President Clinton signed the Helms-Burton Act into law on March 12, 1996. For years after its passing, Helms criticized the corporate interests that sought to lift the sanctions on Cuba, writing an article in 1999 for \"Foreign Affairs\", at whose publisher, the Council on Foreign Relations, also drew Helms's ire for its softer approach to Cuba.\n1996 re-election campaign.\nIn 1996, Helms drew 1,345,833 (52.6 percent) to Gantt's 1,173,875 (45.9 percent). Helms supported his former Senate colleague Bob Dole for president, while Gantt endorsed Bill Clinton. Although Helms is generally credited with being the most successful Republican politician in North Carolina history, his largest proportion of the vote in any of his five elections was 54.5 percent. In North Carolina, Helms was a polarizing figure, and he freely admitted that many people in the state strongly disliked him: \"[The Democrats] could nominate Mortimer Snerd and he'd automatically get 45 percent of the vote.\" Helms was particularly popular among older, conservative constituents, and was considered one of the last \"Old South\" politicians to have served in the Senate. However, he also considered himself a voice of conservative youth, whom he hailed in the dedication of his autobiography.\nFifth Senate term (1997\u20132003).\nWeld ambassadorial nomination.\nThe summer of 1997 saw Helms engage in a protracted, high-profile battle to block the nomination of William Weld, Republican Governor of Massachusetts, as Ambassador to Mexico: refusing to hold a committee meeting to schedule a confirmation hearing. Although he did not make a formal statement of his reason, Helms did criticize Weld's support for medical marijuana, which Senate conservatives saw as incompatible with Mexico's key role in the War on Drugs. Weld attacked Helms's politics, saying, \"I am not Senator Helms's kind of Republican. I do not pass his litmus test on social policy. Nor do I want to.\" This opened Helms to counter on Weld's positions on abortion, gay rights, and other issues on which he had a liberal position. Other factors, such as Weld's noncommittal position on Helms's chairmanship during his 1996 Senate campaign and Weld's wife's donation to the Gantt campaign, made the nomination personal and less cooperative. Held up in the committee by Helms, despite Weld resigning his governorship to concentrate on the nomination and a petition signed by most senators, his nomination died.\nCuba.\nIn January 1998, Helms endorsed a legislative proposal by the Cuban-American National Foundation to provide 100 million worth of food and medicine so long as Havana could promise the assistance would not be allocated to government stores or officials of the Communist Party. In the same statement, Helms said Pope John Paul II's visit to Cuba had \"created a historic opportunity for bold action\" in the country. On May 15, Helms announced a proposal of 100 million aid package for Cuba that would provide food and medical assistance to the Cuban people by the Roman Catholic Church and politically independent relief organizations. Helms stated the proposal would hurt Castro's regime if he either accepted or rejected it and the proposal was endorsed by more than twenty senators from both parties. In his memoir, Helms stated the only reason Castro was able to maintain leadership in Cuba was the direct result of the Clinton administration not making his removal an objective of its foreign policy. He asserted the administration should have worked to develop strategies to undermine Castro and instead spent years \"wasting precious time and energy on a senseless debate over whether to lift the Cuban embargo unilaterally\".\nHelms saw the Bush administration as \"understanding of the nature\" of Castro and his crimes and stated his hope that an American president would eventually be able to visit Cuba at a time when the latter country and the United States could welcome each other as friends and trading partners.\nIn May 2001, Helms cosponsored legislation with Connecticut Democrat Joe Lieberman granting 100 million in aid to both government critics and independent workers in Cuba during the period of the following four years and said the aim of the bill was to provide financial assistance to domestic opponents of the Cuban government so that they could continue their work. The legislation was \"the first major legislative proposal by hard-line critics\" since the Helms-Burton Act and Helms promoted its enactment in a statement by saying it would see the United States government \"move beyond merely isolating the Castro regime\" which could be undermined \"by finding bold, proactive and creative programs to help those working for change on the island\". In July, President Bush announced his intent to waive a portion of the Helms-Burton Act authorizing lawsuits against businesses operating in Cuba for six months in the national interest of the US and to aid administration efforts to \"expedite the transition to democracy in Cuba\". Helms released a statement defending Bush, saying \"it would be wise to consider the other salutary initiatives that the president is putting into force\" before criticizing the decision and credited Bush with \"taking a very tough line which is certain to make Fidel Castro squirm\".\nFinal Senate years.\nIn January 1997, during the confirmation hearings for Secretary of State nominee Madeleine Albright, Helms stated President Clinton's first term had left adversaries of the United States in doubt of their resolve and that \"a lot of Americans\" were praying she would issue in a change during her tenure. Two months later, after being confirmed, Albright traveled with Helms to his boyhood home and the Jesse Helms Center for discussions on the treaty to ban chemical arms, Helms afterward saying the pair would not have any issues if they continued being able to cooperate but stressed that the treaty would not assist with protecting Americans. In a March 1998 letter to Albright, Helms stated his opposition \"to the creation of a permanent U.N. criminal court\" and the United Nations becoming \"a sovereign entity\", Helms spokesman Marc Thiessen confirming concerns of the senator \"that a permanent tribunal will turn into a petty claims court that will spend its time taking up complaints about the United States\" and thereby serve the function of the General Assembly.\nIn September 1997, amid the Senate voting to repeal a 50 billion tax break for the tobacco industry, Helms joined Mitch McConnell and Lauch Faircloth in being one of three senators to vote against the amendment.\nIn January 1998, President Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky became public. Helms found the revelation \"damning\", having little patience for sexual transgressions and said anyone that would advocate President Clinton's \"should be excused, already announced their total lack of character\". In remarks the following month, Helms stated the scandal had left him saddened for the United States and President Clinton's daughter Chelsea. Helms exercised caution on the impeachment issue, refraining from announcing his vote until right before Clinton's Senate trial in January of the following year. \"The Washington Post\" noted Helms as the only one of the nine senators who had by then served a quarter century to vote in favor of Lewinsky making an appearance before the chamber. In his memoir, Helms stated that his vote against Clinton was not personal and that he understood \"the fallibility of every human, and the power of Grace\", but that he was unwilling to deny the Constitution not allowing \"gradients of wrongdoing\" since Clinton was proven to have lied under oath.\nIn March 1998, after the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to add Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Helms predicted the resolution would pass overwhelmingly in the full chamber and said the vote was a testament to \"confidence in the democracies of Eastern Europe\".\nIn May 1998, while delivering remarks to Therma, Inc. employees, President Clinton listed Helms as one of the senators who had aided the intent of Partnership for Peace.\nWhile the United States cast one of four votes against the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, adopted by a 120 to 4 vote in July 1998, President Clinton signed the Statute for the United States. However, Helms was strident in his opposition and let it be known that any attempt to have the Senate ratify the Statute would be \"dead on arrival\" at the Foreign Relations Committee. He also introduced the American Service-Members' Protection Act, adopted by Congress in 2002 \"to protect United States military personnel and other elected and appointed officials of the United States government against criminal prosecution by an international criminal court to which the United States is not party\".\nIn June 1999, after President Clinton nominated Richard Holbrooke for United States Ambassador to the United Nations, the Clinton administration expressed concerns with Helms's silence on whether he would allow a vote on Holbrooke's nomination. In a June 5 statement, Helms announced the date of the four hearings and that Holbrooke would be questioned regarding his career, specifically his mediating role in negotiations of the Bosnia accords with President of Yugoslavia Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107. Helms added that he could not \"recall another Cabinet-level nomination sent to this committee with so much ethical baggage attached to it\". During the confirmation hearings, Helms stated that Holbrooke had violated the law repeatedly. In response, Holbrooke apologized and admitted to his \"misconceptions\" regarding ethics, Helms afterward expressing optimism toward the nomination as a result of Holbrooke's remorse. Three months later, after President Clinton nominating former Senator Carol Moseley-Braun for United States Ambassador to New Zealand, Helms released a statement saying the \"nomination comes to the Senate with an ethical cloud hanging over Ms. Moseley-Braun\" and questioned if her record had even been examined by the Clinton administration. An article published around the same time as the statement by \"Roll Call\" indicated Helms would prevent the nomination unless Moseley-Braun \"amends for past slights\" such as her opposition to the renewal of the emblem for the Daughters of the Confederacy. Helms subsequently demanded documents relating to Moseley-Braun's ethical charges and delayed confirmation hearings until receiving them. On November 9, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted to endorse Moseley-Braun 17 to 1, Helms being the lone vote against the nomination. When the Senate voted to confirm Moseley-Braun, Helms was joined by Peter Fitzgerald, who defeated Moseley-Braun in her re-election bid, in being the only two senators to vote against her.\nIn 2000, Bono sought out Jesse Helms to discuss increasing American aid to Africa. In Africa, AIDS is a disease that is primarily transmitted heterosexually, and Helms sympathized with Bono's description of \"the pain it is bringing to infants and children and their families\". Helms insisted that Bono involve the international community and private sector, so that relief efforts would not be paid for by \"just Americans\". Helms coauthored a bill authorizing $600 million for international AIDS relief efforts. In 2002, Helms announced that he was ashamed to have done so little during his Senate career to fight the worldwide spread of AIDS, and pledged to do more during his last few months in the Senate. Helms spoke with special appreciation of the efforts of Janet Museveni, first lady of Uganda, for her efforts to stop the spread of AIDS through a campaign based on \"biblical values and sexual purity\". Helms also was a proponent in trying to dissolve the United States Agency for International Development.\nIn January 2001, Helms stated he would support an increase in international assistance on the condition that all future aid from the United States be provided to the needy by private charities and religious groups as opposed to a government agency, and endorsed abolishing the United States Agency for International Development and concurrently transferring its 7 billion in annual aid to another foundation which would give grants to private relief groups.\nIn March 2002, Helms and Democrat Joe Biden, in their positions as the ranking members of their parties on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, submitted a letter to the Bush administration demanding the Senate receive any nuclear arms reductions with Russia as a formal treaty.\nRetirement.\nBecause of recurring health problems, including bone disorders, prostate cancer and heart disease, Helms did not seek re-election in 2002. His Senate seat was won by Republican Elizabeth Dole.\nPost-Senate life (2003\u20132008).\nIn 2004, he spoke out for the election of Republican U.S. Representative Richard Burr, who, like Elizabeth Dole two years earlier, defeated Democrat Erskine Bowles to win the other North Carolina Senate seat. In September 2005, Random House published his memoir \"Here's Where I Stand\". In his memoirs, he likened abortion to the Holocaust and the September 11 terrorist attacks stating, \"I will never be silent about the death of those who cannot speak for themselves.\" Helms had also been recruited by pop star Bono for charity work.\nIn 1994, after turning down requests for his papers to be left to an Ivy League university, he designated Wingate University as the repository of the official papers and historical items from his Senate career, where the Jesse Helms Center is based to promote his legacy. In 2005, Liberty University opened the Jesse Helms School of Government with Helms present at the dedication.\nDeath.\nHelms's health remained poor after he retired from the Senate in 2003. In April 2006, news reports disclosed that Helms had multi-infarct dementia, which leads to failing memory and diminished cognitive function, as well as a number of physical difficulties. He was later moved into a convalescent center near his home. Helms died of vascular dementia during the early morning hours of July 4, 2008, at the age of 86. He is buried in Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nSocial and political views.\nViews on race.\nJesse Helms was accused of racism throughout his career. Two years before Helms's 2003 retirement from the Senate, David Broder of \"The Washington Post\" wrote a column headlined \"Jesse Helms, White Racist\", analyzing Helms's public record on race, a record he felt many other reporters were side-stepping. He said that Helms was willing to inflame racial resentment against African-Americans for political gain and dubbed Helms \"the last prominent unabashed white racist politician in this country\".\nEarly in his career, as news director for WRAL radio, Helms supported Willis Smith in the 1950 Democratic primary for the U.S. Senate, against Frank Porter Graham, in a campaign that used racial issues in a divisive way, in order to draw conservative white voters to the polls. Portraying Graham as favoring interracial marriages, the campaign circulated placards with the heading, \"White people, wake up before it is too late\"; and a handbill that showed Graham's wife dancing with a black man. When Smith won, Helms went to Washington as his administrative assistant.\nHelms opposed busing, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act. Helms called the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"the single most dangerous piece of legislation ever introduced in the Congress\", and sponsored legislation to either extend it to the entire country or scrap it altogether. In 1982, he voted against the extension of the Voting Rights Act.\nHelms reminded voters that he tried, with a 16-day filibuster, to stop the Senate from approving a federal holiday to honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., although he had fewer reservations about establishing a North Carolina state holiday for King. He has been accused of being a segregationist by some political observers and scholars, such as \"USA Today\"'s DeWayne Wickham who wrote that Helms \"subtly carried the torch of white supremacy\" from Ben Tillman. Helms never stated that segregation was morally wrong and expressed the belief that integration would have been achieved voluntarily but that it was forced by \"outside agitators who had their own agendas\".\nIn 1996, the Department of Justice admonished Helms's 1990 campaign for mailing 125,000 postcards to households in predominantly African-American precincts warning them (incorrectly) that they could go to jail if they had not updated their addresses on the electoral register since moving.\nBesides opposing civil rights and affirmative action legislation, Helms, for ideological reasons, blocked many black judges from being considered for the federal bench, and black appointees to positions of prominence in the Federal Government. In one instance, he blocked attempts by President Bill Clinton over a period of years to appoint a black judge on the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Only when Helms's own judicial choices were threatened with blocking did attorney Roger Gregory of Richmond, Virginia get confirmed.\nViews on homosexuality.\nHelms had a negative view of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people and LGBT rights in the United States. Helms called homosexuals \"weak, morally sick wretches\" and tried to cut funding for the National Endowment for the Arts for supporting the \"gay-oriented artwork of photographer Robert Mapplethorpe\". In 1993, when then-president Bill Clinton wanted to appoint 'out' lesbian Roberta Achtenberg to assistant secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, Helms held up the confirmation \"because she's a damn lesbian\", adding \"she's not your garden-variety lesbian. She's a militant-activist-mean lesbian\". Helms also stated \"I'm not going to put a lesbian in a position like that. If you want to call me a bigot, fine.\" When Clinton urged that gays be allowed to serve openly in the armed forces, Helms said the president \"better have a bodyguard\" if he visited North Carolina. His views on gay and lesbian citizens were depicted in the 1998 documentary film \"Dear Jesse\".\nHelms initially fought against increasing federal financing for HIV/AIDS research and treatment, saying the disease resulted from \"unnatural\" and \"disgusting\" homosexual behavior. In his final year in the Senate, he strongly supported AIDS measures in Africa, where heterosexual transmission of the disease is most common, and continued to hold the belief that the \"homosexual lifestyle\" is the cause of the spread of the epidemic in America.\nDuring his 1990 campaign against Harvey Gantt, Helms ran television commercials accusing Mr. Gantt of running a \"secret campaign\" in homosexual communities and of being committed to \"mandatory gay rights laws\" including \"requiring local schools to hire gay teachers\".\nIn 1993, when he voted against confirming Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court, he cited her support for the \"homosexual agenda\" as one of his reasons for doing so.\nIn his 2017 memoir, \"\", gay author Armistead Maupin recalls that Helms described homosexuality as an \"abomination\" when he was working for him as a young man. Maupin adds that he later gave an interview about his first novel on the same TV station, and said, \"I worked here when Jesse Helms was here. Now he's in Washington, ranting about militant homosexuals, and I'm out running around being one.\"\nPersonal life.\nFamily.\nJesse and Dot had two daughters, Jane and Nancy, and adopted a nine-year-old orphan with cerebral palsy named Charles after reading in a newspaper that Charles wanted a mother and father for Christmas. The couple had seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild. One of his grandchildren, Jennifer Knox, later became a judge in Wake County, North Carolina.\nReligious views.\nHelms was well known for his strong Christian religious views. He played a leading role in the development of the Christian right, and was a founding member of the Moral Majority in 1979. Although a Southern Baptist from his upbringing in a strictly literalist, but hawkishly secularist, environment, when in Raleigh, Helms worshipped at the moderate Hayes-Barton Baptist Church, where he had served as a deacon and Sunday school teacher before his election to the Senate.\nHelms was close to fellow North Carolinian Billy Graham (whom he considered a personal hero), as well as Charles Stanley, Pat Robertson, and Jerry Falwell, whose Liberty University dedicated its Jesse Helms School of Government to Helms. Helms helped found Camp Willow Run, an interdenominational Christian summer camp, sitting on its board of directors until his death, and was a Grand Orator of the Masonic Grand Lodge of North Carolina.\nEquating leftism and atheism, Helms argued that the downfall of the U.S. was due to loss of Christian faith, and often stated, \"I think God is giving this country one more chance to save itself\". He believed that the morality of capitalism was assured in the Bible, through the Parable of the Talents. He believed, writing in \"When Free Men Shall Stand\", that \"such utopian slogans as Peace with Honor, Minimum Wage, Racial Equality, Women's Liberation, National Health Insurance, Civil Liberty\" are ploys by which to divide humanity \"as sons of God\".\nAwards.\nHelms held honorary degrees from several religious universities including Bob Jones University, Campbell University, Grove City College, and his alma mater, Wingate University."}
{"title": "Andrew_Johnson", "label": "Politician", "text": "Andrew Johnson (December 29, 1808July 31, 1875) was the 17th president of the United States, serving from 1865 to 1869. He assumed the presidency as he was vice president at the time of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln. Johnson was a Democrat who ran with Lincoln on the National Union ticket, coming to office as the Civil War concluded. He favored quick restoration of the seceded states to the Union without protection for the former slaves. This led to conflict with the Republican-dominated Congress, culminating in his impeachment by the House of Representatives in 1868. He was acquitted in the Senate by one vote.\nJohnson was born into poverty and never attended school. He was apprenticed as a tailor and worked in several frontier towns before settling in Greeneville, Tennessee. He served as alderman and mayor there before being elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1835. After briefly serving in the Tennessee Senate, Johnson was elected to the House of Representatives in 1843, where he served five two-year terms. He became governor of Tennessee for four years, and was elected by the legislature to the Senate in 1857. In his congressional service, he sought passage of the Homestead Bill which was enacted soon after he left his Senate seat in 1862. Southern slave states seceded to form the Confederate States of America, including Tennessee, but Johnson remained firmly with the Union. He was the only sitting senator from a Confederate state who did not resign his seat upon learning of his state's secession. In 1862, Lincoln appointed him as Military Governor of Tennessee after most of it had been retaken. In 1864, Johnson was a logical choice as running mate for Lincoln, who wished to send a message of national unity in his re-election campaign; and became vice president after a victorious election in 1864.\nJohnson implemented his own form of Presidential Reconstruction, a series of proclamations directing the seceded states to hold conventions and elections to reform their civil governments. Southern states returned many of their old leaders and passed Black Codes to deprive the freedmen of many civil liberties, but Congressional Republicans refused to seat legislators from those states and advanced legislation to overrule the Southern actions. Johnson vetoed their bills, and Congressional Republicans overrode him, setting a pattern for the remainder of his presidency. Johnson opposed the Fourteenth Amendment which gave citizenship to former slaves. In 1866, he went on an unprecedented national tour promoting his executive policies, seeking to break Republican opposition. As the conflict grew between the branches of government, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act restricting Johnson's ability to fire Cabinet officials. He persisted in trying to dismiss Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, but ended up being impeached by the House of Representatives and narrowly avoided conviction in the Senate. He did not win the 1868 Democratic presidential nomination and left office the following year.\nJohnson returned to Tennessee after his presidency and gained some vindication when he was elected to the Senate in 1875, making him the only former president to serve in the Senate. He died five months into his term. Johnson's strong opposition to federally guaranteed rights for black Americans is widely criticized; he is regarded by many historians as one of the worst presidents in American history.\nEarly life and career.\nChildhood.\nAndrew Johnson was born in Raleigh, North Carolina, on December 29, 1808, to Jacob Johnson (1778\u20131812) and Mary (\"Polly\") McDonough (1783\u20131856), a laundress. He was of English, Scots-Irish, and Irish ancestry. He had a brother William, four years his senior, and an older sister Elizabeth, who died in childhood. Johnson's birth in a two-room shack was a political asset in the mid-19th century, and he would frequently remind voters of his humble origins. Jacob Johnson was a poor man, as had been his father, William Johnson, but he became town constable of Raleigh before marrying and starting a family. Both Jacob and Mary were illiterate, and had worked as tavern servants, while Johnson never attended school and grew up in poverty. Jacob died of an apparent heart attack while ringing the town bell, shortly after rescuing three drowning men, when his son Andrew was three. Polly Johnson worked as a washerwoman and became the sole support of her family. Her occupation was then looked down on, as it often took her into other homes unaccompanied. Since Andrew did not resemble either of his siblings, there are rumors that he may have been fathered by another man. Polly Johnson eventually remarried to a man named Turner Doughtry, who was as poor as she was.\nJohnson's mother apprenticed her son William to a tailor, James Selby. Andrew also became an apprentice in Selby's shop at age ten and was legally bound to serve until his 21st birthday. Johnson lived with his mother for part of his service, and one of Selby's employees taught him rudimentary literacy skills. His education was augmented by citizens who would come to Selby's shop to read to the tailors as they worked. Even before he became an apprentice, Johnson came to listen. The readings caused a lifelong love of learning, and one of his biographers, Annette Gordon-Reed, suggests that Johnson, later a gifted public speaker, learned the art as he threaded needles and cut cloth.\nJohnson was not happy at James Selby's, and after about five years, both he and his brother ran away. Selby responded by placing a reward for their return: \"Ten Dollars Reward. Ran away from the subscriber, two apprentice boys, legally bound, named William and Andrew Johnson\u00a0... [payment] to any person who will deliver said apprentices to me in Raleigh, or I will give the above reward for Andrew Johnson alone.\" The brothers went to Carthage, North Carolina, where Andrew Johnson worked as a tailor for several months. Fearing he would be arrested and returned to Raleigh, Johnson moved to Laurens, South Carolina. He found work quickly, met his first love, Mary Wood, and made her a quilt as a gift. However, she rejected his marriage proposal. He returned to Raleigh, hoping to buy out his apprenticeship, but could not come to terms with Selby. Unable to stay in Raleigh, where he risked being apprehended for abandoning Selby, he decided to move west.\nMove to Tennessee.\nJohnson left North Carolina for Tennessee, traveling mostly on foot. After a brief period in Knoxville, he moved to Mooresville, Alabama. He then worked as a tailor in Columbia, Tennessee, but was called back to Raleigh by his mother and stepfather, who saw limited opportunities there and who wished to emigrate west. Johnson and his party traveled through the Blue Ridge Mountains to Greeneville, Tennessee. Andrew Johnson fell in love with the town at first sight, and when he became prosperous purchased the land where he had first camped and planted a tree in commemoration.\nIn Greeneville, Johnson established a successful tailoring business in the front of his home. In 1827, at the age of 18, he married 16-year-old Eliza McCardle, the daughter of a local shoemaker. The pair were married by Justice of the Peace Mordecai Lincoln, first cousin of Thomas Lincoln, whose son would become president. The Johnsons were married for almost 50 years and had five children: Martha (1828), Charles (1830), Mary (1832), Robert (1834), and Andrew Jr. (1852). Though she suffered from tuberculosis, Eliza supported her husband's endeavors. She taught him mathematics skills and tutored him to improve his writing. Shy and retiring by nature, Eliza Johnson usually remained in Greeneville during Johnson's political rise. She was not often seen during her husband's presidency; their daughter Martha usually served as official hostess.\nJohnson's tailoring business prospered during the early years of the marriage, enabling him to hire help and giving him the funds to invest profitably in real estate. He later boasted of his talents as a tailor, \"my work never ripped or gave way\". He was a voracious reader. Books about famous orators aroused his interest in political dialogue, and he had private debates on the issues of the day with customers who held opposing views. He also took part in debates at Greeneville College.\nJohnson's slaves.\nIn 1843, Johnson purchased his first slave, Dolly, who was 14 years old at the time. Soon after, he purchased Dolly's half-brother Sam. Dolly had three children\u2014Liz, Florence and William. In 1857, Andrew Johnson purchased Henry, who was 13 at the time and would later accompany the Johnson family to the White House. Sam Johnson and his wife Margaret had nine children. Sam became a commissioner of the Freedmen's Bureau and was known for being a proud man who negotiated the nature of his work with the Johnson family. Notably, he received some monetary compensation for his labors and negotiated with Andrew Johnson to receive a tract of land which Andrew Johnson gave him for free in 1867. Ultimately, Johnson owned at least ten slaves.\nAndrew Johnson freed his slaves on August 8, 1863; they remained with him as paid servants. A year later, Johnson, as military governor of Tennessee, proclaimed the freedom of Tennessee's slaves. Sam and Margaret, Johnson's former slaves, lived in his tailor shop while he was president, without rent. As a sign of appreciation for proclaiming freedom, Andrew Johnson was given a watch by newly emancipated people in Tennessee inscribed with \"\u2026for his Untiring Energy in the Cause of Freedom\".\nPolitical rise.\nTennessee politician.\nJohnson helped organize a mechanics' (working men's) ticket in the 1829 Greeneville municipal election. He was elected town alderman, along with his friends Blackston McDannel and Mordecai Lincoln. Following the 1831 Nat Turner slave rebellion, a state convention was called to pass a new constitution, including provisions to disenfranchise free people of color. The convention also wanted to reform real estate tax rates, and provide ways of funding improvements to Tennessee's infrastructure. The constitution was submitted for a public vote, and Johnson spoke widely for its adoption; the successful campaign provided him with statewide exposure. On January 4, 1834, his fellow aldermen elected him mayor of Greeneville.\nIn 1835, Johnson made a bid for election to the \"floater\" seat which Greene County shared with neighboring Washington County in the Tennessee House of Representatives. According to his biographer, Hans L. Trefousse, Johnson \"demolished\" the opposition in debate and won the election with almost a two to one margin. During his Greeneville days, Johnson joined the Tennessee Militia as a member of the 90th Regiment. He attained the rank of colonel, though while an enrolled member, Johnson was fined for an unknown offense. Afterwards, he was often addressed or referred to by his rank.\nIn his first term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not consistently vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and fellow Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system in a state of flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while his constituents hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for reelection in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.\nIn 1840, Johnson was selected as a presidential elector for Tennessee, giving him more statewide publicity. Although Democratic President Martin Van Buren was defeated by former Ohio senator William Henry Harrison, Johnson was instrumental in keeping Tennessee and Greene County in the Democratic column. He was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1841, where he served a two-year term. He had achieved financial success in his tailoring business, but sold it to concentrate on politics. He had also acquired additional real estate, including a larger home and a farm (where his mother and stepfather took residence), and among his assets numbered eight or nine slaves.\nUnited States Representative (1843\u20131853).\nHaving served in both houses of the state legislature, Johnson saw election to Congress as the next step in his political career. He engaged in a number of political maneuvers to gain Democratic support, including the displacement of the Whig postmaster in Greeneville, and defeated Jonesborough lawyer John A. Aiken by 5,495 votes to 4,892. In Washington, he joined a new Democratic majority in the House of Representatives. Johnson advocated for the interests of the poor, maintained an anti-abolitionist stance, argued for only limited spending by the government and opposed protective tariffs. With Eliza remaining in Greeneville, Congressman Johnson shunned social functions in favor of study in the Library of Congress. Although a fellow Tennessee Democrat, James K. Polk, was elected president in 1844, and Johnson had campaigned for him, the two men had difficult relations, and President Polk refused some of his patronage suggestions.\nJohnson believed, as did many Southern Democrats, that the Constitution protected private property, including slaves, and thus prohibited the federal and state governments from abolishing slavery. He won a second term in 1845 against William G. Brownlow, presenting himself as the defender of the poor against the aristocracy. In his second term, Johnson supported the Polk administration's decision to fight the Mexican War, seen by some Northerners as an attempt to gain territory to expand slavery westward, and opposed the Wilmot Proviso, a proposal to ban slavery in any territory gained from Mexico. He introduced for the first time his Homestead Bill, to grant to people willing to settle the land and gain title to it. This issue was especially important to Johnson because of his own humble beginnings.\nIn the presidential election of 1848, the Democrats split over the slavery issue, and abolitionists formed the Free Soil Party, with former president Van Buren as their nominee. Johnson supported the Democratic candidate, former Michigan senator Lewis Cass. With the party split, Whig nominee General Zachary Taylor was easily victorious, and carried Tennessee. Johnson's relations with Polk remained poor; the President recorded of his final New Year's reception in 1849 that\nJohnson, due to national interest in new railroad construction and in response to the need for better transportation in his own district, also supported government assistance for the East Tennessee and Virginia Railroad.\nIn his campaign for a fourth term, Johnson concentrated on three issues: slavery, homesteads and judicial elections. He defeated his opponent, Nathaniel G. Taylor, in August 1849, with a greater margin of victory than in previous campaigns. When the House convened in December, the party division caused by the Free Soil Party precluded the formation of the majority needed to elect a Speaker. Johnson proposed adoption of a rule allowing election of a Speaker by a plurality; some weeks later others took up a similar proposal, and Democrat Howell Cobb was elected.\nOnce the Speaker election had concluded and Congress was ready to conduct legislative business, the issue of slavery took center stage. Northerners sought to admit California, a free state, to the Union. Kentucky's Henry Clay introduced in the Senate a series of resolutions, the Compromise of 1850, to admit California and pass legislation sought by each side. Johnson voted for all the provisions except for the abolition of slavery in the nation's capital. He pressed resolutions for constitutional amendments to provide for popular election of senators (then elected by state legislatures) and of the president (chosen by the Electoral College), and limiting the tenure of federal judges to 12 years. These were all defeated.\nA group of Democrats nominated Landon Carter Haynes to oppose Johnson as he sought a fifth term; the Whigs were so pleased with the internecine battle among the Democrats in the general election that they did not nominate a candidate of their own. The campaign included fierce debates: Johnson's main issue was the passage of the Homestead Bill; Haynes contended it would facilitate abolition. Johnson won the election by more than 1600 votes. Though he was not enamored of the party's presidential nominee in 1852, former New Hampshire senator Franklin Pierce, Johnson campaigned for him. Pierce was elected, but he failed to carry Tennessee. In 1852, Johnson managed to get the House to pass his Homestead Bill, but it failed in the Senate. The Whigs had gained control of the Tennessee legislature, and, under the leadership of Gustavus Henry, redrew the boundaries of Johnson's First District to make it a safe seat for their party. The \"Nashville Union\" termed this \"Henry-mandering\"; lamented Johnson, \"I have no political future.\"\nGovernor of Tennessee (1853\u20131857).\nIf Johnson considered retiring from politics upon deciding not to seek reelection, he soon changed his mind. His political friends began to maneuver to get him the nomination for governor. The Democratic convention unanimously named him, though some party members were not happy at his selection. The Whigs had won the past two gubernatorial elections, and still controlled the legislature. That party nominated Henry, making the \"Henry-mandering\" of the First District an immediate issue. The two men debated in county seats the length of Tennessee before the meetings were called off two weeks before the August 1853 election due to illness in Henry's family. Johnson won the election by 63,413 votes to 61,163; some votes for him were cast in return for his promise to support Whig Nathaniel Taylor for his old seat in Congress.\nTennessee's governor had little power: Johnson could propose legislation but not veto it, and most appointments were made by the Whig-controlled legislature. Nevertheless, the office was a \"bully pulpit\" that allowed him to publicize himself and his political views. He succeeded in getting the appointments he wanted in return for his endorsement of John Bell, a Whig, for one of the state's U.S. Senate seats. In his first biennial speech, Johnson urged simplification of the state judicial system, abolition of the Bank of Tennessee, and establishment of an agency to provide uniformity in weights and measures; the last was passed. Johnson was critical of the Tennessee common school system and suggested funding be increased via taxes, either statewide or county by county\u2014a mixture of the two was passed. Reforms carried out during Johnson's time as governor included the foundation of the State's public library (making books available to all) and its first public school system, and the initiation of regular state fairs to benefit craftsmen and farmers.\nAlthough the Whig Party was on its final decline nationally, it remained strong in Tennessee, and the outlook for Democrats there in 1855 was poor. Feeling that reelection as governor was necessary to give him a chance at the higher offices he sought, Johnson agreed to make the run. Meredith P. Gentry received the Whig nomination. A series of more than a dozen vitriolic debates ensued. The issues in the campaign were slavery, the prohibition of alcohol, and the nativist positions of the Know Nothing Party. Johnson favored the first, but opposed the others. Gentry was more equivocal on the alcohol question, and had gained the support of the Know Nothings, a group Johnson portrayed as a secret society. Johnson was unexpectedly victorious, albeit with a narrower margin than in 1853.\nWhen the presidential election of 1856 approached, Johnson hoped to be nominated; some Tennessee county conventions designated him a \"favorite son\". His position that the best interests of the Union were served by slavery in some areas made him a practical compromise candidate for president. He was never a major contender; the nomination fell to former Pennsylvania senator James Buchanan. Though he was not impressed by either, Johnson campaigned for Buchanan and his running mate, John C. Breckinridge, who were elected.\nJohnson decided not to seek a third term as governor, with an eye towards election to the U.S. Senate. In 1857, while returning from Washington, his train derailed, causing serious damage to his right arm. This injury would trouble him in the years to come.\nUnited States Senator.\nHomestead Bill advocate.\nThe victors in the 1857 state legislative campaign would, once they convened in October, elect a United States Senator. Former Whig governor William B. Campbell wrote to his uncle, \"The great anxiety of the Whigs is to elect a majority in the legislature so as to defeat Andrew Johnson for senator. Should the Democrats have the majority, he will certainly be their choice, and there is no man living to whom the Americans and Whigs have as much antipathy as Johnson.\" The governor spoke widely in the campaign, and his party won the gubernatorial race and control of the legislature. Johnson's final address as governor gave him the chance to influence his electors, and he made proposals popular among Democrats. Two days later the legislature elected him to the Senate. The opposition was appalled, with the Richmond \"Whig\" newspaper referring to him as \"the vilest radical and most unscrupulous demagogue in the Union\".\nJohnson gained high office due to his proven record as a man popular among the small farmers and self-employed tradesmen who made up much of Tennessee's electorate. He called them the \"plebeians\"; he was less popular among the planters and lawyers who led the state Democratic Party, but none could match him as a vote-getter. After his death, one Tennessee voter wrote of him, \"Johnson was always the same to everyone\u00a0... the honors heaped upon him did not make him forget to be kind to the humblest citizen.\" Always seen in impeccably tailored clothing, he cut an impressive figure, and had the stamina to endure lengthy campaigns with daily travel over bad roads leading to another speech or debate. Mostly denied the party's machinery, he relied on a network of friends, advisers, and contacts. One friend, Hugh Douglas, stated in a letter to him, \"you have been in the way of our would be great men for a long time. At heart many of us never wanted you to be Governor only none of the rest of us Could have been elected at the time and we only wanted to use you. Then we did not want you to go to the Senate but \"the people would send you\".\"\nThe new senator took his seat when Congress convened in December 1857 (the term of his predecessor, James C. Jones, had expired in March). He came to Washington as usual without his wife and family; Eliza would visit Washington only once during Johnson's first time as senator, in 1860. Johnson immediately set about introducing the Homestead Bill in the Senate, but as most senators who supported it were Northern (many associated with the newly founded Republican Party), the matter became caught up in suspicions over the slavery issue. Southern senators felt that those who took advantage of the provisions of the Homestead Bill were more likely to be Northern non-slaveholders. The issue of slavery had been complicated by the Supreme Court's ruling earlier in the year in \"Dred Scott v. Sandford\" that slavery could not be prohibited in the territories. Johnson, a slaveholding senator from a Southern state, made a major speech in the Senate the following May in an attempt to convince his colleagues that the Homestead Bill and slavery were not incompatible. Nevertheless, Southern opposition was key to defeating the legislation, 30\u201322. In 1859, it failed on a procedural vote when Vice President Breckinridge broke a tie against the bill, and in 1860, a watered-down version passed both houses, only to be vetoed by Buchanan at the urging of Southerners. Johnson continued his opposition to spending, chairing a committee to control it.\nHe argued against funding to build infrastructure in Washington, D.C., stating that it was unfair to expect state citizens to pay for the city's streets, even if it was the seat of government. He opposed spending money for troops to put down the revolt by the Mormons in Utah Territory, arguing for temporary volunteers as the United States should not have a standing army.\nSecession crisis.\nIn October 1859, abolitionist John Brown and sympathizers raided the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry, Virginia (today West Virginia). Tensions in Washington between pro- and anti-slavery forces increased greatly. Johnson gave a major speech in the Senate in December, decrying Northerners who would endanger the Union by seeking to outlaw slavery. The Tennessee senator stated that \"all men are created equal\" from the Declaration of Independence did not apply to African Americans, since the Constitution of Illinois contained that phrase\u2014and that document barred voting by African Americans. Johnson, by this time, was a wealthy man who owned 14 slaves.\nJohnson hoped that he would be a compromise candidate for the presidential nomination as the Democratic Party tore itself apart over the slavery question. Busy with the Homestead Bill during the 1860 Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, he sent two of his sons and his chief political adviser to represent his interests in the backroom deal-making. The convention deadlocked, with no candidate able to gain the required two-thirds vote, but the sides were too far apart to consider Johnson as a compromise. The party split, with Northerners backing Illinois Senator Stephen Douglas while Southerners, including Johnson, supported Vice President Breckinridge for president. With former Tennessee senator John Bell running a fourth-party candidacy and further dividing the vote, the Republican Party elected its first president, former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln. The election of Lincoln, known to be against the spread of slavery, was unacceptable to many in the South. Although secession from the Union had not been an issue in the campaign, talk of it began in the Southern states.\nJohnson took to the Senate floor after the election, giving a speech well received in the North, \"I will not give up this government\u00a0... No; I intend to stand by it\u00a0... and I invite every man who is a patriot to\u00a0... rally around the altar of our common country\u00a0... and swear by our God, and all that is sacred and holy, that the Constitution shall be saved, and the Union preserved.\" As Southern senators announced they would resign if their states seceded, he reminded Mississippi Senator Jefferson Davis that if Southerners would only hold to their seats, the Democrats would control the Senate, and could defend the South's interests against any infringement by Lincoln. Gordon-Reed points out that while Johnson's belief in an indissoluble Union was sincere, he had alienated Southern leaders, including Davis, who would soon be the president of the Confederate States of America, formed by the seceding states. If the Tennessean had backed the Confederacy, he would have had small influence in its government.\nJohnson returned home when his state took up the issue of secession. His successor as governor, Isham G. Harris, and the legislature organized a referendum on whether to have a constitutional convention to authorize secession; when that failed, they put the question of leaving the Union to a popular vote. Despite threats on Johnson's life, and actual assaults, he campaigned against both questions, sometimes speaking with a gun on the lectern before him. Although Johnson's eastern region of Tennessee was largely against secession, the second referendum passed, and in June 1861, Tennessee joined the Confederacy. Believing he would be killed if he stayed, Johnson fled through the Cumberland Gap, where his party was in fact shot at. He left his wife and family in Greeneville.\nAs the only member from a seceded state to remain in the Senate and the most prominent Southern Unionist, Johnson had Lincoln's ear in the early months of the war. With most of Tennessee in Confederate hands, Johnson spent congressional recesses in Kentucky and Ohio, trying in vain to convince any Union commander who would listen to conduct an operation into East Tennessee.\nMilitary Governor of Tennessee.\nJohnson's first tenure in the Senate came to a conclusion in March 1862 when Lincoln appointed him military governor of Tennessee. Much of the central and western portions of that seceded state had been recovered. Although some argued that civil government should simply resume once the Confederates were defeated in an area, Lincoln chose to use his power as commander in chief to appoint military governors over Union-controlled Southern regions. The Senate quickly confirmed Johnson's nomination along with the rank of brigadier general. In response, the Confederates confiscated his land and his slaves, and turned his home into a military hospital. Later in 1862, after his departure from the Senate and in the absence of most Southern legislators, the Homestead Bill was finally enacted. Along with legislation for land-grant colleges and for the transcontinental railroad, the Homestead Bill has been credited with opening the American West to settlement.\nAs military governor, Johnson sought to eliminate rebel influence in the state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and the ebb and flow of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family to pass through the lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as well as he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until General William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.\nWhen Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation in January 1863, declaring freedom for all slaves in Confederate-held areas, he exempted Tennessee at Johnson's request. The proclamation increased the debate over what should become of the slaves after the war, as not all Unionists supported abolition. Johnson finally decided that slavery had to end. He wrote, \"If the institution of slavery\u00a0... seeks to overthrow it [the Government], then the Government has a clear right to destroy it\". He reluctantly supported efforts to enlist former slaves into the Union Army, feeling that African Americans should perform menial tasks to release white Americans to do the fighting. Nevertheless, he succeeded in recruiting 20,000 black soldiers to serve the Union.\nVice Presidency (1865).\nIn 1860, Lincoln's running mate had been Senator Hannibal Hamlin of Maine. Although Hamlin had served competently, was in good health, and was willing to run again, Johnson emerged as running mate for Lincoln's reelection bid in 1864.\nLincoln considered several War Democrats for the ticket in 1864, and sent an agent to sound out General Benjamin Butler as a possible running mate. In May 1864, the president dispatched General Daniel Sickles to Nashville on a fact-finding mission. Although Sickles denied that he was there either to investigate or interview the military governor, Johnson biographer Hans L. Trefousse believes that Sickles's trip was connected to Johnson's subsequent nomination for vice president. According to historian Albert Castel in his account of Johnson's presidency, Lincoln was impressed by Johnson's administration of Tennessee. Gordon-Reed points out that while the Lincoln-Hamlin ticket might have been considered geographically balanced in 1860, \"having Johnson, the \"southern\" War Democrat, on the ticket sent the right message about the folly of secession and the continuing capacity for union within the country.\" Another factor was the desire of Secretary of State William Seward to frustrate the vice-presidential candidacy of fellow New Yorker and former senator Daniel S. Dickinson, a War Democrat, as Seward would probably have had to yield his place if another New Yorker became vice president. Johnson, once he was told by reporters the likely purpose of Sickles' visit, was active on his own behalf, delivering speeches and having his political friends work behind the scenes to boost his candidacy.\nTo sound a theme of unity in 1864, Lincoln ran under the banner of the National Union Party, rather than that of the Republicans. At the party's convention in Baltimore in June, Lincoln was easily nominated, although there had been some talk of replacing him with a Cabinet officer or one of the more successful generals. After the convention backed Lincoln, former Secretary of War Simon Cameron offered a resolution to nominate Hamlin, but it was defeated. Johnson was nominated for vice president by C.M. Allen of Indiana with an Iowa delegate as seconder. On the first ballot, Johnson led with 200 votes to 150 for Hamlin and 108 for Dickinson. On the second ballot, Kentucky switched to vote for Johnson, beginning a stampede. Johnson was named on the second ballot with 491 votes to Hamlin's 17 and eight for Dickinson; the nomination was made unanimous. Lincoln expressed pleasure at the result, \"Andy Johnson, I think, is a good man.\" When word reached Nashville, a crowd assembled and the military governor obliged with a speech contending his selection as a Southerner meant that the rebel states had not actually left the Union.\nAlthough it was unusual at the time for a national candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while reestablishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear that they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.\nNow Vice President-elect, Johnson was eager to complete the work of reestablishing civilian government in Tennessee, although the timetable for the election of a new governor did not allow it to take place until after Inauguration Day, March 4. He hoped to remain in Nashville to complete his task, but was told by Lincoln's advisers that he could not stay, but would be sworn in with Lincoln. In these months, Union troops finished the retaking of eastern Tennessee, including Greeneville. Just before his departure, the voters of Tennessee ratified a new constitution, which abolished slavery, on February 22, 1865. One of Johnson's final acts as military governor was to certify the results.\nJohnson traveled to Washington to be sworn into office, although according to Gordon-Reed, \"in light of what happened on March 4, 1865, it might have been better if Johnson had stayed in Nashville.\" Johnson may have been ill; Castel cited typhoid fever, though Gordon-Reed notes that there is no independent evidence for that diagnosis. On the evening of March 3, Johnson attended a party in his honor at which he drank heavily. Hung over the following morning at the Capitol, he asked Vice President Hamlin for some whiskey. Hamlin produced a bottle, and Johnson took two stiff drinks, stating \"I need all the strength for the occasion I can have.\" In the Senate Chamber, Johnson delivered a rambling address as Lincoln, the Congress, and dignitaries looked on. Almost incoherent at times, he finally meandered to a halt, whereupon Hamlin hastily swore him in as vice president. Lincoln, who had watched sadly during the debacle, then went to his own swearing-in outside the Capitol, and delivered his acclaimed Second Inaugural Address.\nIn the weeks after the inauguration, Johnson only presided over the Senate briefly, and hid from public ridicule at the Maryland home of a friend, Francis Preston Blair. When he did return to Washington, it was with the intent of leaving for Tennessee to reestablish his family in Greeneville. Instead, he remained after word came that General Ulysses S. Grant had captured the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, presaging the end of the war. Lincoln stated, in response to criticism of Johnson's behavior, that \"I have known Andy Johnson for many years; he made a bad slip the other day, but you need not be scared; Andy ain't a drunkard.\"\nPresidency (1865\u20131869).\nAccession.\nOn the afternoon of April 14, 1865, Lincoln and Johnson met for the first time since the inauguration. Trefousse states that Johnson wanted to \"induce Lincoln not to be too lenient with traitors\"; Gordon-Reed agrees.\nThat night, President Lincoln was shot and mortally wounded by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer. The shooting of the President was part of a conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln, Johnson, and Seward the same night. Seward barely survived his wounds, while Johnson escaped attack as his would-be assassin, George Atzerodt, got drunk instead of killing the vice president. Leonard J. Farwell, a fellow boarder at the Kirkwood House, awoke Johnson with news of Lincoln's shooting at Ford's Theatre. Johnson rushed to the President's deathbed, where he remained a short time, on his return promising, \"They shall suffer for this. They shall suffer for this.\" Lincoln died at 7:22\u00a0am the next morning; Johnson's swearing-in occurred between 10 and 11\u00a0am with Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase presiding in the presence of most of the Cabinet. Johnson's demeanor was described by the newspapers as \"solemn and dignified\". Some Cabinet members had last seen Johnson, apparently drunk, at the inauguration. At noon, Johnson conducted his first Cabinet meeting in the Treasury Secretary's office, and asked all members to remain in their positions.\nThe events of the assassination resulted in speculation, then and subsequently, concerning Johnson and what the conspirators might have intended for him. In the vain hope of having his life spared after his capture, Atzerodt spoke much about the conspiracy, but did not say anything to indicate that the plotted assassination of Johnson was merely a ruse. Conspiracy theorists point to the fact that on the day of the assassination, Booth came to the Kirkwood House and left one of his cards with Johnson's private secretary, William A. Browning. The message on it was: \"Don't wish to disturb you. Are you at home? J. Wilkes Booth.\"\nJohnson presided with dignity over Lincoln's funeral ceremonies in Washington, before his predecessor's body was sent home to Springfield, Illinois, for interment. Shortly after Lincoln's death, Union General William T. Sherman reported he had, without consulting Washington, reached an armistice agreement with Confederate General Joseph E. Johnston for the surrender of Confederate forces in North Carolina in exchange for the existing state government remaining in power, with private property rights (slaves) to be respected. This did not even grant freedom to those in slavery. This was not acceptable to Johnson or the Cabinet, who sent word for Sherman to secure the surrender without making political deals, which he did. Further, Johnson placed a $100,000 bounty (equivalent to $ in ) on Confederate President Davis, then a fugitive, which gave Johnson the reputation of a man who would be tough on the South. More controversially, he permitted the execution of Mary Surratt for her part in Lincoln's assassination. Surratt was executed with three others, including Atzerodt, on July 7, 1865.\nReconstruction.\nBackground.\nUpon taking office, Johnson faced the question of what to do with the former Confederacy. President Lincoln had authorized loyalist governments in Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Tennessee as the Union came to control large parts of those states and advocated a ten percent plan that would allow elections after ten percent of the voters in any state took an oath of future loyalty to the Union. Congress considered this too lenient; its own plan, requiring a majority of voters to take the loyalty oath, passed both houses in 1864, but Lincoln pocket vetoed it.\nJohnson had three goals in Reconstruction. He sought a speedy restoration of the states, on the grounds that they had never truly left the Union, and thus should again be recognized once loyal citizens formed a government. To Johnson, African-American suffrage was a delay and a distraction; it had always been a state responsibility to decide who should vote. Second, political power in the Southern states should pass from the planter class to his beloved \"plebeians\". Johnson feared that the freedmen, many of whom were still economically bound to their former masters, might vote at their direction. Johnson's third priority was election in his own right in 1868, a feat no one who had succeeded a deceased president had managed to accomplish, attempting to secure a Democratic anti-Congressional Reconstruction coalition in the South.\nThe Republicans had formed a number of factions. The Radical Republicans sought voting and other civil rights for African Americans. They believed that the freedmen could be induced to vote Republican in gratitude for emancipation, and that black votes could keep the Republicans in power and Southern Democrats, including former rebels, out of influence. They believed that top Confederates should be punished. The Moderate Republicans sought to keep the Democrats out of power at a national level, and prevent former rebels from resuming power. They were not as enthusiastic about the idea of African-American suffrage as their Radical colleagues, either because of their own local political concerns, or because they believed that the freedman would be likely to cast his vote badly. Northern Democrats favored the unconditional restoration of the Southern states. They did not support African-American suffrage, which might threaten Democratic control in the South.\nPresidential Reconstruction.\nJohnson was initially left to devise a Reconstruction policy without legislative intervention, as Congress was not due to meet again until December 1865. Radical Republicans told the President that the Southern states were economically in a state of chaos and urged him to use his leverage to insist on rights for freedmen as a condition of restoration to the Union. But Johnson, with the support of other officials including Seward, insisted that the franchise was a state, not a federal matter. The Cabinet was divided on the issue.\nJohnson's first Reconstruction actions were two proclamations, with the unanimous backing of his Cabinet, on May 29. One recognized the Virginia government led by provisional Governor Francis Pierpont. The second provided amnesty for all ex-rebels except those holding property valued at $20,000 or more; it also appointed a temporary governor for North Carolina and authorized elections. Neither of these proclamations included provisions regarding black suffrage or freedmen's rights. The President ordered constitutional conventions in other former rebel states.\nAs Southern states began the process of forming governments, Johnson's policies received considerable public support in the North, which he took as unconditional backing for quick reinstatement of the South. While he received such support from the white South, he underestimated the determination of Northerners to ensure that the war had not been fought for nothing. It was important, in Northern public opinion, that the South acknowledge its defeat, that slavery be ended, and that the lot of African Americans be improved. Voting rights were less important\u2014after all, only a handful of Northern states (mostly in New England) gave African-American men the right to vote on the same basis as whites, and in late 1865, Connecticut, Wisconsin, and Minnesota voted down African-American suffrage proposals by large margins. Northern public opinion tolerated Johnson's inaction on black suffrage as an experiment, to be allowed if it quickened Southern acceptance of defeat. Instead, white Southerners felt emboldened. A number of Southern states passed Black Codes, binding African-American laborers to farms on annual contracts they could not quit, and allowing law enforcement at whim to arrest them for vagrancy and rent out their labor. Most Southerners elected to Congress were former Confederates, with the most prominent being Georgia Senator-designate and former Confederate vice president Alexander Stephens. Congress assembled in early December 1865; Johnson's conciliatory annual message to them was well received. Nevertheless, Congress refused to seat the Southern legislators and established a committee to recommend appropriate Reconstruction legislation.\nNortherners were outraged at the idea of unrepentant Confederate leaders, such as Stephens, rejoining the federal government at a time when emotional wounds from the war remained raw. They saw the Black Codes placing African Americans in a position barely above slavery. Republicans also feared that restoration of the Southern states would return the Democrats to power. In addition, according to David O. Stewart in his book on Johnson's impeachment, \"the violence and poverty that oppressed the South would galvanize the opposition to Johnson\".\nBreak with the Republicans: 1866.\nCongress was reluctant to confront the President, and initially only sought to fine-tune Johnson's policies towards the South. According to Trefousse, \"If there was a time when Johnson could have come to an agreement with the moderates of the Republican Party, it was the period following the return of Congress\". The President was unhappy about the provocative actions of the Southern states, and about the continued control by the antebellum elite there, but made no statement publicly, believing that Southerners had a right to act as they did, even if it was unwise to do so. By late January 1866, he was convinced that winning a showdown with the Radical Republicans was necessary to his political plans \u2013 both for the success of Reconstruction and for reelection in 1868. He would have preferred that the conflict arise over the legislative efforts to enfranchise African Americans in the District of Columbia, a proposal that had been defeated overwhelmingly in an all-white referendum. A bill to accomplish this passed the House of Representatives, but to Johnson's disappointment, stalled in the Senate before he could veto it.\nIllinois Senator Lyman Trumbull, leader of the Moderate Republicans and Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, was anxious to reach an understanding with the President. He ushered through Congress a bill extending the Freedmen's Bureau beyond its scheduled abolition in 1867, and the first Civil Rights Bill, to grant citizenship to the freedmen. Trumbull met several times with Johnson and was convinced the President would sign the measures (Johnson rarely contradicted visitors, often fooling those who met with him into thinking he was in accord). In fact, the President opposed both bills as infringements on state sovereignty. Additionally, both of Trumbull's bills were unpopular among white Southerners, whom Johnson hoped to include in his new party. Johnson vetoed the Freedman's Bureau bill on February 18, 1866, to the delight of white Southerners and the puzzled anger of Republican legislators. He considered himself vindicated when a move to override his veto failed in the Senate the following day. Johnson believed that the Radicals would now be isolated and defeated and that the moderate Republicans would form behind him; he did not understand that Moderates also wanted to see African Americans treated fairly.\nOn February 22, 1866, Washington's Birthday, Johnson gave an impromptu speech to supporters who had marched to the White House and called for an address in honor of the first president. In his hour-long speech, he instead referred to himself over 200 times. More damagingly, he also spoke of \"men\u00a0... still opposed to the Union\" to whom he could not extend the hand of friendship he gave to the South. When called upon by the crowd to say who they were, Johnson named Pennsylvania Congressman Thaddeus Stevens, Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, and abolitionist Wendell Phillips, and accused them of plotting his assassination. Republicans viewed the address as a declaration of war, while one Democratic ally estimated Johnson's speech cost the party 200,000 votes in the 1866 congressional midterm elections.\nAlthough strongly urged by moderates to sign the Civil Rights Act of 1866, Johnson broke decisively with them by vetoing it on March 27. In his veto message, he objected to the measure because it conferred citizenship on the freedmen at a time when 11 out of 36 states were unrepresented in the Congress, and that it discriminated in favor of African Americans and against whites. Within three weeks, Congress had overridden his veto, the first time that had been done on a major bill in American history. The veto, often seen as a key mistake of Johnson's presidency, convinced moderates there was no hope of working with him. Historian Eric Foner, in his volume on Reconstruction, views it as \"the most disastrous miscalculation of his political career\". According to Stewart, the veto was \"for many his defining blunder, setting a tone of perpetual confrontation with Congress that prevailed for the rest of his presidency\".\nCongress also proposed the Fourteenth Amendment to the states. Written by Trumbull and others, it was sent for ratification by state legislatures in a process in which the president plays no part, though Johnson opposed it. The amendment was designed to put the key provisions of the Civil Rights Act into the Constitution, but also went further. The amendment extended citizenship to every person born in the United States (except Indians on reservations), penalized states that did not give the vote to freedmen, and most importantly, created new federal civil rights that could be protected by federal courts. It also guaranteed that the federal debt would be paid and forbade repayment of Confederate war debts. Further, it disqualified many former Confederates from office, although the disability could be removed \u2014 by Congress, not the president. Both houses passed the Freedmen's Bureau Act a second time, and again the President vetoed it; this time, the veto was overridden. By the summer of 1866, when Congress finally adjourned, Johnson's method of restoring states to the Union by executive fiat, without safeguards for the freedmen, was in deep trouble. His home state of Tennessee ratified the Fourteenth Amendment despite the President's opposition. When Tennessee did so, Congress immediately seated its proposed delegation, embarrassing Johnson.\nEfforts to compromise failed, and a political war ensued between the united Republicans on one side, and on the other, Johnson and his Northern and Southern allies in the Democratic Party. He called a convention of the National Union Party. Republicans had returned to using their previous identifier; Johnson intended to use the discarded name to unite his supporters and gain election to a full term, in 1868. The battleground was the election of 1866; Southern states were not allowed to vote. Johnson campaigned vigorously, undertaking a public speaking tour, known as the \"Swing Around the Circle\". The trip, including speeches in Chicago, St. Louis, Indianapolis, and Columbus, proved politically disastrous, with the President making controversial comparisons between himself and Christ, and engaging in arguments with hecklers. These exchanges were attacked as beneath the dignity of the presidency. The Republicans won by a landslide, increasing their two-thirds majority in Congress, and made plans to control Reconstruction. Johnson blamed the Democrats for giving only lukewarm support to the National Union movement.\nRadical Reconstruction.\nEven with the Republican victory in November 1866, Johnson considered himself in a strong position. The Fourteenth Amendment had been ratified by none of the Southern or border states except Tennessee, and had been rejected in Kentucky, Delaware, and Maryland. As the amendment required ratification by three-quarters of the states to become part of the Constitution, he believed the deadlock would be broken in his favor, leading to his election in 1868. Once it reconvened in December 1866, an energized Congress began passing legislation, often over a presidential veto; this included the District of Columbia voting bill. Congress admitted Nebraska to the Union over a veto, and the Republicans gained two senators and a state that promptly ratified the amendment. Johnson's veto of a bill for statehood for Colorado Territory was sustained; enough senators agreed that a district with a population of 30,000 was not yet worthy of statehood to win the day.\nIn January 1867, Congressman Stevens introduced legislation to dissolve the Southern state governments and reconstitute them into five military districts, under martial law. The states would begin again by holding constitutional conventions. African Americans could vote for or become delegates; former Confederates could not. In the legislative process, Congress added to the bill that restoration to the Union would follow the state's ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment, and completion of the process of adding it to the Constitution. Johnson and the Southerners attempted a compromise, whereby the South would agree to a modified version of the amendment without the disqualification of former Confederates, and for limited black suffrage. The Republicans insisted on the full language of the amendment, and the deal fell through. Although Johnson could have pocket vetoed the First Reconstruction Act as it was presented to him less than ten days before the end of the Thirty-Ninth Congress, he chose to veto it directly on March 2, 1867; Congress overruled him the same day. Also on March 2, Congress passed the Tenure of Office Act over the President's veto, in response to statements during the Swing Around the Circle that he planned to fire Cabinet secretaries who did not agree with him. This bill, requiring Senate approval for the firing of Cabinet members during the tenure of the president who appointed them and for one month afterwards, was immediately controversial, with some senators doubting that it was constitutional or that its terms applied to Johnson, whose key Cabinet officers were Lincoln holdovers.\nImpeachment.\nSecretary of War Edwin Stanton was an able and hard-working man, but difficult to deal with. Johnson both admired and was exasperated by his War Secretary, who, in combination with General of the Army Grant, worked to undermine the president's Southern policy from within his own administration. Johnson considered firing Stanton, but respected him for his wartime service as secretary. Stanton, for his part, feared allowing Johnson to appoint his successor and refused to resign, despite his public disagreements with his president.\nThe new Congress met for a few weeks in March 1867, then adjourned, leaving the House Committee on the Judiciary behind, charged with reporting back to the full House whether there were grounds for Johnson to be impeached. This committee duly met, examined the President's bank accounts, and summoned members of the Cabinet to testify. When a federal court released former Confederate president Davis on bail on May 13 (he had been captured shortly after the war), the committee investigated whether the President had impeded the prosecution. It learned that Johnson was eager to have Davis tried. A bipartisan majority of the committee voted down impeachment charges; the committee adjourned on June 3.\nLater in June, Johnson and Stanton battled over the question of whether the military officers placed in command of the South could override the civil authorities. The President had Attorney General Henry Stanbery issue an opinion backing his position that they could not. Johnson sought to pin down Stanton either as for, and thus endorsing Johnson's position, or against, showing himself to be opposed to his president and the rest of the Cabinet. Stanton evaded the point in meetings and written communications. When Congress reconvened in July, it passed a Reconstruction Act against Johnson's position, waited for his veto, overrode it, and went home. In addition to clarifying the powers of the generals, the legislation also deprived the President of control over the Army in the South. With Congress in recess until November, Johnson decided to fire Stanton and relieve one of the military commanders, General Philip Sheridan, who had dismissed the governor of Texas and installed a replacement with little popular support. Johnson was initially deterred by a strong objection from Grant, but on August 5, the President demanded Stanton's resignation; the secretary refused to quit with Congress out of session. Johnson then suspended him pending the next meeting of Congress as permitted under the Tenure of Office Act; Grant agreed to serve as temporary replacement while continuing to lead the Army.\nGrant, under protest, followed Johnson's order transferring Sheridan and another of the district commanders, Daniel Sickles, who had angered Johnson by firmly following Congress's plan. The President also issued a proclamation pardoning most Confederates, exempting those who held office under the Confederacy, or who had served in federal office before the war but had breached their oaths. Although Republicans expressed anger with his actions, the 1867 elections generally went Democratic. No seats in Congress were directly elected in the polling, but the Democrats took control of the Ohio General Assembly, allowing them to defeat for reelection one of Johnson's strongest opponents, Senator Benjamin Wade. Voters in Ohio, Connecticut, and Minnesota turned down propositions to grant African Americans the vote.\nThe adverse results momentarily put a stop to Republican calls to impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.\nJohnson notified Congress of Stanton's suspension and Grant's interim appointment. In January 1868, the Senate disapproved of his action, and reinstated Stanton, contending the President had violated the Tenure of Office Act. Grant stepped aside over Johnson's objection, causing a complete break between them. Johnson then dismissed Stanton and appointed Lorenzo Thomas to replace him. Stanton refused to leave his office, and on February 24, 1868, the House impeached the President for intentionally violating the Tenure of Office Act, by a vote of 128 to 47. The House subsequently adopted eleven articles of impeachment, for the most part alleging that he had violated the Tenure of Office Act, and had questioned the legitimacy of Congress.\nOn March 5, 1868, the impeachment trial began in the Senate and lasted almost three months; Congressmen George S. Boutwell, Benjamin Butler and Thaddeus Stevens acted as managers for the House, or prosecutors, and William M. Evarts, Benjamin R. Curtis and former Attorney General Stanbery were Johnson's counsel; Chief Justice Chase served as presiding judge.\nThe defense relied on the provision of the Tenure of Office Act that made it applicable only to appointees of the current administration. Since Lincoln had appointed Stanton, the defense maintained Johnson had not violated the act, and also argued that the President had the right to test the constitutionality of an act of Congress. Johnson's counsel insisted that he make no appearance at the trial, nor publicly comment about the proceedings, and except for a pair of interviews in April, he complied.\nJohnson maneuvered to gain an acquittal; for example, he pledged to Iowa Senator James W. Grimes that he would not interfere with Congress's Reconstruction efforts. Grimes reported to a group of Moderates, many of whom voted for acquittal, that he believed the President would keep his word. Johnson also promised to install the respected John Schofield as War Secretary. Kansas Senator Edmund G. Ross received assurances that the new, Radical-influenced constitutions ratified in South Carolina and Arkansas would be transmitted to the Congress without delay, an action which would give him and other senators political cover to vote for acquittal.\nOne reason senators were reluctant to remove the President was that his successor would have been Ohio Senator Wade, the president \"pro tempore\" of the Senate. Wade, a lame duck who left office in early 1869, was a Radical who supported such measures as women's suffrage, placing him beyond the pale politically in much of the nation. Additionally, a President Wade was seen as an obstacle to Grant's ambitions.\nWith the dealmaking, Johnson was confident of the result in advance of the verdict, and in the days leading up to the ballot, newspapers reported that Stevens and his Radicals had given up. On May 16, the Senate voted on the 11th article of impeachment, accusing Johnson of firing Stanton in violation of the Tenure of Office of Act once the Senate had overturned his suspension. Thirty-five senators voted \"guilty\" and 19 \"not guilty\", thus falling short by a single vote of the two-thirds majority required for conviction under the Constitution. Seven Republicans\u2014Senators Grimes, Ross, Trumbull, William Pitt Fessenden, Joseph S. Fowler, John B. Henderson, and Peter G. Van Winkle\u2014voted to acquit the President. With Stevens bitterly disappointed at the result, the Senate then adjourned for the Republican National Convention; Grant was nominated for president. The Senate returned on May 26 and voted on the second and third articles, with identical 35\u201319 results. Faced with those results, Johnson's opponents gave up and dismissed proceedings. Stanton \"relinquished\" his office on May 26, and the Senate subsequently confirmed Schofield. When Johnson renominated Stanbery to return to his position as Attorney General after his service as a defense manager, the Senate refused to confirm him.\nAllegations were made at the time and again later that bribery dictated the outcome of the trial. Even when it was in progress, Representative Butler began an investigation, held contentious hearings, and issued a report, unendorsed by any other congressman. Butler focused on a New York\u2013based \"Astor House Group\", supposedly led by political boss and editor Thurlow Weed. This organization was said to have raised large sums of money from whiskey interests through Cincinnati lawyer Charles Woolley to bribe senators to acquit Johnson. Butler went so far as to imprison Woolley in the Capitol building when he refused to answer questions, but failed to prove bribery.\nForeign policy.\nSoon after taking office as president, Johnson reached an accord with Secretary of State William H. Seward that there would be no change in foreign policy. In practice, this meant that Seward would continue to run things as he had under Lincoln. Seward and Lincoln had been rivals for the nomination in 1860; the victor hoped that Seward would succeed him as president in 1869. At the time of Johnson's accession, the French had intervened in Mexico, sending troops there. While many politicians had indulged in saber rattling over the Mexican matter, Seward preferred quiet diplomacy, warning the French through diplomatic channels that their presence in Mexico was unacceptable. Although the President preferred a more aggressive approach, Seward persuaded him to follow his lead. In April 1866, the French government informed Seward that its troops would be brought home in stages, to conclude by November 1867. On August 14, 1866, Johnson and his cabinet gave a reception for Queen Emma of Hawaii who was returning to Hawaii after her trip to Britain and Europe.\nSeward was an expansionist, and sought opportunities to gain territory for the United States. After the loss of the Crimean War in the 1850s, the Russian government saw its North American colony (today Alaska) as a financial liability, and feared losing control to Britain whose troops would easily swoop in and annex the territory from neighboring Canada in any future conflict. Negotiations between Russia and the U.S. over the sale of Alaska were halted due to the outbreak of the Civil War, but after the U.S. victory in the war, talks resumed. Russia instructed its minister in Washington, Baron Eduard de Stoeckl, to negotiate a sale. De Stoeckl did so deftly, getting Seward to raise his offer from $5 million (coincidentally, the minimum that Russia had instructed de Stoeckl to accept) to $7 million, and then getting $200,000 added by raising various objections. This sum of $7.2 million is equivalent to $ in present-day terms. On March 30, 1867, de Stoeckl and Seward signed the treaty, working quickly as the Senate was about to adjourn. Johnson and Seward took the signed document to the President's Room in the Capitol, only to be told there was no time to deal with the matter before adjournment. The President summoned the Senate into session to meet on April 1; that body approved the treaty, 37\u20132. Emboldened by his success in Alaska, Seward sought acquisitions elsewhere. His only success was staking an American claim to uninhabited Wake Island in the Pacific, which would be officially claimed by the U.S. in 1898. He came close with the Danish West Indies as Denmark agreed to sell and the local population approved the transfer in a plebiscite, but the Senate never voted on the treaty and it expired.\nAnother treaty that fared badly was the Johnson-Clarendon convention, negotiated in settlement of the \"Alabama\" Claims, for damages to American shipping from British-built Confederate raiders. Negotiated by the United States Minister to Britain, former Maryland senator Reverdy Johnson, in late 1868, it was ignored by the Senate during the remainder of the President's term. The treaty was rejected after he left office, and the Grant administration later negotiated considerably better terms from Britain.\nAdministration and Cabinet.\nJudicial appointments.\nJohnson appointed nine Article III federal judges during his presidency, all to United States district courts; he did not appoint a justice to serve on the Supreme Court. In April 1866, he nominated Henry Stanbery to fill the vacancy left with the death of John Catron, but Congress eliminated the seat to prevent the appointment, and to ensure that he did not get to make any appointments eliminated the next vacancy as well, providing that the court would shrink by one justice when one next departed from office. Johnson appointed his Greeneville crony, Samuel Milligan, to the United States Court of Claims, where he served from 1868 until his death in 1874.\nReforms initiated.\nIn June 1866, Johnson signed the Southern Homestead Act into law, believing that the legislation would assist poor whites. Around 28,000 land claims were successfully patented, although few former slaves benefitted from the law, fraud was rampant, and much of the best land was off-limits, reserved for grants to veterans or railroads. In June 1868, Johnson signed an eight-hour law passed by Congress that established an eight-hour workday for laborers and mechanics employed by the Federal Government. Although Johnson told members of a Workingmen's party delegation in Baltimore that he could not directly commit himself to an eight-hour day, he nevertheless told the same delegation that he greatly favoured the \"shortest number of hours consistent with the interests of all\". According to Richard F. Selcer, however, the good intentions behind the law were \"immediately frustrated\" as wages were cut by 20%.\nCompletion of term.\nJohnson sought nomination by the 1868 Democratic National Convention in New York in July 1868. He remained very popular among Southern whites, and boosted that popularity by issuing, just before the convention, a pardon ending the possibility of criminal proceedings against any Confederate not already indicted, meaning that only Davis and a few others still might face trial. On the first ballot, Johnson was second to former Ohio representative George H. Pendleton, who had been his Democratic opponent for vice president in 1864. Johnson's support was mostly from the South, and fell away as the ballots passed. On the 22nd ballot, former New York governor Horatio Seymour was nominated, and the President received only four votes, all from Tennessee.\nThe conflict with Congress continued. Johnson sent Congress proposals for amendments to limit the president to a single six-year term and make the president and the Senate directly elected, and for term limits for judges. Congress took no action on them. When the President was slow to officially report ratifications of the Fourteenth Amendment by the new Southern legislatures, Congress passed a bill, again over his veto, requiring him to do so within ten days of receipt. He still delayed as much as he could, but was required, in July 1868, to report the ratifications making the amendment part of the Constitution.\nSeymour's operatives sought Johnson's support, but he long remained silent on the presidential campaign. It was not until October, with the vote already having taken place in some states, that he mentioned Seymour at all, and he never endorsed him. Nevertheless, Johnson regretted Grant's victory, in part because of their animus from the Stanton affair. In his annual message to Congress in December, Johnson urged the repeal of the Tenure of Office Act and told legislators that had they admitted their Southern colleagues in 1865, all would have been well. He celebrated his 60th birthday in late December with a party for several hundred children, though not including those of President-elect Grant, who did not allow his to go.\nOn Christmas Day 1868, Johnson issued a final amnesty, this one covering everyone, including Davis. He also issued, in his final months in office, pardons for crimes, including one for Dr. Samuel Mudd, controversially convicted of involvement in the Lincoln assassination (he had set Booth's broken leg) and imprisoned in on Florida's Dry Tortugas.\nOn March 3, the President hosted a large public reception at the White House on his final full day in office. Grant had made it known that he was unwilling to ride in the same carriage as Johnson, as was customary, and Johnson refused to go to the inauguration at all. Despite an effort by Seward to prompt a change of mind, he spent the morning of March 4 finishing last-minute business, and then shortly after noon rode from the White House to the home of a friend.\nPost-presidency (1869\u20131875).\nAfter leaving the presidency, Johnson remained for some weeks in Washington, then returned to Greeneville for the first time in eight years. He was honored with large public celebrations along the way, especially in Tennessee, where cities hostile to him during the war hung out welcome banners. He had arranged to purchase a large farm near Greeneville to live on after his presidency.\nSome expected Johnson to run for Governor of Tennessee or for the Senate again, while others thought that he would become a railroad executive. Johnson found Greeneville boring, and his private life was embittered by the suicide of his son Robert in 1869. Seeking vindication for himself, and revenge against his political enemies, he launched a Senate bid soon after returning home. Tennessee had gone Republican, but court rulings restoring the vote to some whites and the violence of the Ku Klux Klan suppressing the African-American vote, leading to a Democratic victory in the legislative elections in August 1869. Johnson was seen as a likely victor in the Senate election, although hated by Radical Republicans, and by some Democrats because of his wartime activities. Although he was at one point within a single vote of victory in the legislature's balloting, the Republicans eventually elected Henry Cooper over Johnson, 54\u201351. In 1872, there was a special election for an ; Johnson initially sought the Democratic nomination, but when he saw that it would go to former Confederate general Benjamin F. Cheatham, decided to run as an independent. The former president was defeated, finishing third, but the split in the Democratic Party defeated Cheatham in favor of an old Johnson Unionist ally, Horace Maynard.\nIn 1873, Johnson contracted cholera during an epidemic but recovered; that year he lost about $73,000 when the First National Bank of Washington went under, though he was eventually repaid much of the sum. \nReturn to the Senate.\nHe began looking towards the next Senate election to take place in the legislature in early 1875. Johnson began to woo the farmers' Grange movement; with his Jeffersonian leanings, he easily gained their support. He spoke throughout the state in his final campaign tour. Few African Americans outside the large towns were now able to vote as Reconstruction faded in Tennessee, setting a pattern that would be repeated in the other Southern states; the white domination would last almost a century. In the Tennessee legislative elections in August, the Democrats elected 92 legislators to the Republicans' eight, and Johnson went to Nashville for the legislative session. When the balloting for the Senate seat began on January 20, 1875, he led with 30 votes, but did not have the required majority as three former Confederate generals, one former colonel, and a former Democratic congressman split the vote with him. Johnson's opponents tried to agree on a single candidate who might gain majority support and defeat him, but failed, and he was elected on January 26 on the 54th ballot, with a margin of a single vote. Nashville erupted in rejoicing; remarked Johnson, \"Thank God for the vindication.\"\nJohnson's comeback garnered national attention, with the \"St. Louis Republican\" calling it \"the most magnificent personal triumph which the history of American politics can show\". At his swearing-in in the Senate on March 5, 1875, he was greeted with flowers, and sworn in alongside Hamlin (his predecessor as vice president) by incumbent Vice President Henry Wilson (who as senator had voted for Johnson's ouster). Many Republicans ignored Senator Johnson, though some, such as Ohio's John Sherman (who had voted for conviction), shook his hand. Johnson remains the only former president to serve in the Senate. He spoke only once in the short session, on March 22 lambasting President Grant for his use of federal troops in support of Louisiana's Reconstruction government. The former president asked, \"How far off is military despotism?\" and concluded his speech, \"may God bless this people and God save the Constitution\".\nDeath.\nJohnson returned home after the special session concluded. In late July 1875, convinced some of his opponents were defaming him in the Ohio gubernatorial race, he decided to travel there to give speeches. He began the trip on July 28, and broke the journey at his daughter Mary's farm near Elizabethton, where his daughter Martha was also staying. That evening he suffered a stroke, but refused medical treatment until the next day, when he did not improve and two doctors were sent for from Elizabethton. He seemed to respond to their ministrations, but suffered another stroke on the evening of July 30, and died early the following morning at the age of 66. President Grant had the \"painful duty\" of announcing the death of the only surviving past president. Northern newspapers, in their obituaries, tended to focus on Johnson's loyalty during the war, while Southern ones paid tribute to his actions as president. Johnson's funeral was held on August 3 in Greeneville. He was buried with his body wrapped in an American flag and a copy of the U.S. Constitution placed under his head, according to his wishes. The burial ground was dedicated as the Andrew Johnson National Cemetery in 1906, and with his home and tailor's shop, is part of the Andrew Johnson National Historic Site.\nHistorical reputation and legacy.\nAccording to Castel, \"historians [of Johnson's presidency] have tended to concentrate to the exclusion of practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event [Reconstruction]\". Through the remainder of the 19th century, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency. Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator James G. Blaine, depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the South in Reconstruction, but who was frustrated by Congress. According to historian Howard K. Beale in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction, \"Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth. Thus [Alabama congressman and historian] Hilary Herbert and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies, and Henry Wilson's history was a brief for the North.\"\nThe turn of the 20th century saw the first significant historical evaluations of Johnson. Leading the wave was Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James Ford Rhodes, who wrote of the former president:\nRhodes ascribed Johnson's faults to his personal weaknesses, and blamed him for the problems of the postbellum South. Other early 20th-century historians, such as John Burgess, future president Woodrow Wilson and William Dunning, all Southerners, concurred with Rhodes, believing Johnson flawed and politically inept, but concluding that he had tried to carry out Lincoln's plans for the South in good faith. Author and journalist Jay Tolson suggests that Wilson \"depict[ed Reconstruction] as a vindictive program that hurt even repentant southerners while benefiting northern opportunists, the so-called Carpetbaggers, and cynical white southerners, or Scalawags, who exploited alliances with blacks for political gain\".\nEven as Rhodes and his school wrote, another group of historians was setting out on the full rehabilitation of Johnson, using for the first time primary sources such as his papers, provided by his daughter Martha before her death in 1901, and the diaries of Johnson's Navy Secretary, Gideon Welles, first published in 1911. The resulting volumes, such as David Miller DeWitt's \"The Impeachment and Trial of President Andrew Johnson\" (1903), presented him far more favorably than they did those who had sought to oust him. In James Schouler's 1913 \"History of the Reconstruction Period\", the author accused Rhodes of being \"quite unfair to Johnson\", though agreeing that the former president had created many of his own problems through inept political moves. These works had an effect; although historians continued to view Johnson as having deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency, they saw his Reconstruction policies as fundamentally correct.\nCastel writes:\nBeale wondered in 1940, \"is it not time that we studied the history of Reconstruction without first assuming, at least subconsciously, that carpetbaggers and Southern white Republicans were wicked, that Negroes were illiterate incompetents, and that the whole white South owes a debt of gratitude to the restorers of 'white supremacy'?\" Despite these doubts, the favorable view of Johnson survived for a time. In 1942, Van Heflin portrayed the former president as a fighter for democracy in the Hollywood film \"Tennessee Johnson\". In 1948, a poll of his colleagues by historian Arthur M. Schlesinger deemed Johnson among the average presidents; in 1956, one by Clinton L. Rossiter named him as one of the near-great Chief Executives. Foner notes that at the time of these surveys, \"the Reconstruction era that followed the Civil War was regarded as a time of corruption and misgovernment caused by granting black men the right to vote\".\nEarlier historians, including Beale, believed that money drove events, and had seen Reconstruction as an economic struggle. They also accepted, for the most part, that reconciliation between North and South should have been the top priority of Reconstruction. In the 1950s, historians began to focus on the African-American experience as central to Reconstruction. They rejected completely any claim of black inferiority, which had marked many earlier historical works, and saw the developing civil rights movement as a second Reconstruction; some writers stated they hoped their work on the postbellum era would advance the cause of civil rights. These authors sympathized with the Radical Republicans for their desire to help the African American, and saw Johnson as callous towards the freedman. In a number of works from 1956 onwards by such historians as Fawn Brodie, the former president was depicted as a successful saboteur of efforts to better the freedman's lot. These volumes included major biographies of Stevens and Stanton. Reconstruction was increasingly seen as a noble effort to integrate the freed slaves into society.\nIn the early 21st century, Johnson is among those commonly mentioned as the worst presidents in U.S. history. According to historian Glenn W. Lafantasie, who believes Buchanan the worst president, \"Johnson is a particular favorite for the bottom of the pile because of his impeachment\u00a0... his complete mishandling of Reconstruction policy\u00a0... his bristling personality, and his enormous sense of self-importance.\" Tolson suggests that \"Johnson is now scorned for having resisted Radical Republican policies aimed at securing the rights and well-being of the newly emancipated African-Americans\". Gordon-Reed notes that Johnson, along with his contemporaries Pierce and Buchanan, is generally listed among the five worst presidents, but states, \"there have never been more difficult times in the life of this nation. The problems these men had to confront were enormous. It would have taken a succession of Lincolns to do them justice\".\nTrefousse considers Johnson's legacy to be \"the maintenance of white supremacy. His boost to Southern conservatives by undermining Reconstruction was his legacy to the nation, one that would trouble the country for generations to come\". Gordon-Reed states of Johnson:\nReferences.\nSources.\nPrimary sources"}
{"title": "Clement_Attlee", "label": "Politician", "text": "Clement Richard Attlee, 1st Earl Attlee, (3 January 18838 October 1967) was a British politician who served as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1945 to 1951 and Leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955. He was Deputy Prime Minister during the wartime coalition government under Winston Churchill, and served twice as Leader of the Opposition from 1935 to 1940 and from 1951 to 1955.\nAttlee was born into an upper-middle-class family, the son of a wealthy London solicitor. After attending the public school Haileybury College and the University of Oxford, he practised as a barrister. The volunteer work he carried out in London's East End exposed him to poverty and his political views shifted leftwards thereafter. He joined the Independent Labour Party, gave up his legal career, and began lecturing at the London School of Economics. His work was interrupted by service as an officer in the First World War. In 1919, he became mayor of Stepney and in 1922 was elected Member of Parliament for Limehouse. Attlee served in the first Labour minority government led by Ramsay MacDonald in 1924, and then joined the Cabinet during MacDonald's second minority (1929\u20131931). After retaining his seat in Labour's landslide defeat of 1931, he became the party's Deputy Leader. Elected Leader of the Labour Party in 1935, and at first advocating pacificism and opposing re-armament, he became a critic of Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler and Mussolini in the lead-up to the Second World War. Attlee took Labour into the wartime coalition government in 1940 and served under Winston Churchill, initially as Lord Privy Seal and then as Deputy Prime Minister from 1942.\nFollowing the end of World War II in Europe, the coalition was dissolved and Attlee led Labour to a landslide victory at the 1945 general election, forming the first Labour majority government. His government's Keynesian approach to economic management aimed to maintain full employment, a mixed economy and a greatly enlarged system of social services provided by the state. To this end, it undertook the nationalisation of public utilities and major industries, and implemented wide-ranging social reforms, including the passing of the National Insurance Act 1946 and National Assistance Act, the formation of the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, and the enlargement of public subsidies for council house building. His government also reformed trade union legislation, working practices and children's services; it created the National Parks system, passed the New Towns Act 1946 and established the town and country planning system.\nIn foreign policy, Attlee delegated to Ernest Bevin, but oversaw the partition of India (1947), the independence of Burma and Ceylon, and the dissolution of the British mandates of Palestine and Transjordan. He and Bevin encouraged the United States to take a vigorous role in the Cold War; unable to afford military intervention in Greece, he called on Washington to counter Communists there, establishing the Truman Doctrine. He supported the Marshall Plan to rebuild Western Europe with American money and, in 1949, promoted the NATO military alliance against the Soviet bloc. After leading Labour to a narrow victory at the 1950 general election, he sent British troops to fight in the Korean War.\nAttlee had inherited a country close to bankruptcy after the Second World War and beset by food, housing and resource shortages; despite his social reforms and economic programme, these problems persisted throughout his premiership, alongside recurrent currency crises and dependence on US aid. His party was narrowly defeated by the Conservatives in the 1951 general election, despite winning the most votes. He continued as Labour leader but retired after losing the 1955 election and was elevated to the House of Lords; he died in 1967. In public, he was modest and unassuming, but behind the scenes his depth of knowledge, quiet demeanour, objectivity and pragmatism proved decisive. Often rated as one of the greatest British prime ministers, Attlee's reputation among scholars has grown, thanks to his creation of the modern welfare state and involvement in building the coalition against Joseph Stalin in the Cold War. He remains the longest-serving Labour leader in British history.\nEarly life and education.\nAttlee was born on 3 January 1883 in Putney, Surrey (now part of London), into an upper middle-class family, the seventh of eight children. His father was Henry Attlee (1841\u20131908), a solicitor, and his mother was Ellen Bravery Watson (1847\u20131920), daughter of Thomas Simons Watson, secretary for the Art Union of London. His parents were \"committed Anglicans\" who read prayers and psalms each morning at breakfast.\nAttlee grew up in a two-storey villa with a large garden and tennis court, staffed by three servants and a gardener. His father, a political Liberal, had inherited family interests in milling and brewing, and became a senior partner in the law firm of Druces, also serving a term as president of the Law Society of England and Wales. In 1898 he purchased a estate in Thorpe-le-Soken, Essex. At the age of nine, Attlee was sent to board at Northaw Place, a boys' preparatory school in Hertfordshire. In 1896 he followed his brothers to Haileybury College, where he was a middling student. He was influenced by the Darwinist views of his housemaster Frederick Webb Headley, and in 1899 he published an attack on striking London cab-drivers in the school magazine, predicting they would soon have to \"beg for their fares\".\nIn 1901, Attlee went up to University College, Oxford, reading modern history. He and his brother Tom \"were given a generous stipend by their father and embraced the university lifestyle\u2014rowing, reading and socializing\". He was later described by a tutor as \"level-headed, industrious, dependable man with no brilliance of style\u00a0... but with excellent sound judgement\". At university he had little interest in politics or economics, later describing his views at this time as \"good old fashioned imperialist conservative\". He graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1904 with second-class honours.\nAttlee then trained as a barrister at the Inner Temple and was called to the bar in March 1906. He worked for a time at his father's law firm Druces and Attlee but did not enjoy the work, and had no particular ambition to succeed in the legal profession. He also played football for non-League club Fleet.\nAttlee's father died in 1908, leaving an estate valued for probate at \u00a375,394 (equivalent to \u00a3 in ).\nEarly career.\nIn 1906, he became a volunteer at Haileybury House, a charitable club for working-class boys in Stepney in the East End of London run by his old school, and from 1907 to 1909 he served as the club's manager. Until then, his political views had been more conservative. However, after his shock at the poverty and deprivation he saw while working with the slum children, he came to the view that private charity would never be sufficient to alleviate poverty and that only direct action and income redistribution by the state would have any serious effect. This sparked a process that caused him to convert to socialism. He subsequently joined the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1908 and became active in local politics. In 1909, he stood unsuccessfully at his first election, as an ILP candidate for Stepney Borough Council.\nHe also worked briefly as a secretary for Beatrice Webb in 1909, before becoming a secretary for Toynbee Hall. He worked for Webb's campaign of popularisation of the Minority Report as he was very active in Fabian socialist circles, in which he would go round visiting many political societies\u2014Liberal, Conservative and socialist\u2014to explain and popularise the ideas, as well as recruiting lecturers deemed suitable to work on the campaign. In 1911, he was employed by the UK Government as an \"official explainer\"\u2014touring the country to explain Chancellor of the Exchequer David Lloyd George's National Insurance Act. He spent the summer of that year touring Essex and Somerset on a bicycle, explaining the act at public meetings. A year later, he became a lecturer at the London School of Economics, teaching Social Science and Public Administration. \nMilitary service during the First World War.\nFollowing the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914, Attlee applied to join the British Army. Initially his application was turned down, as at the age of 31 he was seen as being too old; however, he was eventually commissioned as a temporary lieutenant in the 6th (Service) Battalion, South Lancashire Regiment, on 30 September 1914. On 9 February 1915 he was promoted to captain, and on 14 March was appointed battalion adjutant. The 6th South Lancashires were part of the 38th Brigade of the 13th (Western) Division, which served in the Gallipoli campaign in Turkey. Attlee's decision to fight caused a rift between him and his older brother Tom, who, as a conscientious objector, spent much of the war in prison.\nAfter a period spent fighting in Gallipoli, Attlee collapsed after falling ill with dysentery and was put on a ship bound for England to recover. When he woke up he wanted to get back to action as soon as possible, and asked to be let off the ship in Malta, where he stayed in hospital in order to recover. His hospitalisation coincided with the Battle of Sari Bair, which saw a large number of his comrades killed. Upon returning to action, he was informed that his company had been chosen to hold the final lines during the evacuation of Suvla. As such, he was the penultimate man to be evacuated from Suvla Bay, the last being General Stanley Maude.\nThe Gallipoli Campaign had been engineered by the First Lord of the Admiralty, Winston Churchill. Although it was unsuccessful, Attlee believed that it was a bold strategy which could have been successful if it had been better implemented on the ground. This led to an admiration for Churchill as a military strategist, something which would make their working relationship in later years productive.\nHe later served in the Mesopotamian Campaign in what is now Iraq, where in April 1916 he was badly wounded, being hit in the leg by shrapnel while storming an enemy trench during the Battle of Hanna. He was sent firstly to India, and then back to the UK to recover. On 18 December 1916 he was transferred to the Heavy Section of the Machine Gun Corps, and 1 March 1917 he was promoted to the temporary rank of major, leading him to be known as \"Major Attlee\" for much of the inter-war period. He would spend most of 1917 training soldiers at various locations in England. From 2 to 9 July 1917, he was the temporary commanding officer (CO) of the newly formed L (later 10th) Battalion, the Tank Corps at Bovington Camp, Dorset. From 9 July, he assumed command of 30th Company of the same battalion; however, he did not deploy to France with it in December 1917, as he was transferred back to the South Lancashire Regiment on 28 November.\nAfter fully recovering from his injuries, he was sent to France in June 1918 to serve on the Western Front for the final months of the war. After being discharged from the Army in January 1919, he returned to Stepney, and returned to his old job lecturing part-time at the London School of Economics.\nMarriage and children.\nAttlee met Violet Millar while on a long trip with friends to Italy in 1921. They fell in love and were soon engaged, marrying at Christ Church, Hampstead, on 10 January 1922. It would come to be a devoted marriage, with Attlee providing protection and Violet providing a home that was an escape for Attlee from political turmoil. She died in 1964. They had four children:\nEarly political career.\nLocal politics.\nAttlee returned to local politics in the immediate post-war period, becoming mayor of the Metropolitan Borough of Stepney, one of London's most deprived inner-city boroughs, in 1919. During his time as mayor, the council undertook action to tackle slum landlords who charged high rents but refused to spend money on keeping their property in habitable condition. The council served and enforced legal orders on homeowners to repair their property. It also appointed health visitors and sanitary inspectors, reducing the infant mortality rate, and took action to find work for returning unemployed ex-servicemen.\nIn 1920, while mayor, he wrote his first book, \"The Social Worker\", which set out many of the principles that informed his political philosophy and that were to underpin the actions of his government in later years. The book attacked the idea that looking after the poor could be left to voluntary action. He wrote on page 30:In a civilised community, although it may be composed of self-reliant individuals, there will be some persons who will be unable at some period of their lives to look after themselves, and the question of what is to happen to them may be solved in three ways \u2013 they may be neglected, they may be cared for by the organised community as of right, or they may be left to the goodwill of individuals in the community.\nand went on to say at page 75:Charity is only possible without loss of dignity between equals. A right established by law, such as that to an old age pension, is less galling than an allowance made by a rich man to a poor one, dependent on his view of the recipient's character, and terminable at his caprice.\nIn 1921, George Lansbury, the Labour mayor of the neighbouring borough of Poplar, and future Labour Party leader, launched the Poplar Rates Rebellion; a campaign of disobedience seeking to equalise the poor relief burden across all the London boroughs. Attlee, who was a personal friend of Lansbury, strongly supported this. However, Herbert Morrison, the Labour mayor of nearby Hackney, and one of the main figures in the London Labour Party, strongly denounced Lansbury and the rebellion. During this period, Attlee developed a lifelong dislike of Morrison.\nMember of Parliament.\nAt the 1922 general election, Attlee became the Member of Parliament (MP) for the constituency of Limehouse in Stepney. At the time, he admired Ramsay MacDonald and helped him get elected as Labour Party leader at the 1922 leadership election. He served as MacDonald's Parliamentary Private Secretary for the brief 1922 parliament. His first taste of ministerial office came in 1924, when he served as Under-Secretary of State for War in the short-lived first Labour government, led by MacDonald.\nAttlee opposed the 1926 General Strike, believing that strike action should not be used as a political weapon. However, when it happened, he did not attempt to undermine it. At the time of the strike, he was chairman of the Stepney Borough Electricity Committee. He negotiated a deal with the Electrical Trade Union so that they would continue to supply power to hospitals, but would end supplies to factories. One firm, Scammell and Nephew Ltd, took a civil action against Attlee and the other Labour members of the committee (although not against the Conservative members who had also supported this). The court found against Attlee and his fellow councillors and they were ordered to pay \u00a3300 damages. The decision was later reversed on appeal, but the financial problems caused by the episode almost forced Attlee out of politics.\nIn 1927, he was appointed a member of the multi-party Simon Commission, a royal commission set up to examine the possibility of granting self-rule to India. Due to the time he needed to devote to the commission, and contrary to a promise MacDonald made to Attlee to induce him to serve on the commission, he was not initially offered a ministerial post in the Second Labour Government, which entered office after the 1929 general election. Attlee's service on the Commission equipped him with a thorough exposure to India and many of its political leaders. By 1933 he argued that British rule was alien to India and was unable to make the social and economic reforms necessary for India's progress. He became the British leader most sympathetic to Indian independence (as a dominion), preparing him for his role in deciding on independence in 1947.\nIn May 1930, Labour MP Oswald Mosley left the party after its rejection of his proposals for solving the unemployment problem, and Attlee was given Mosley's post of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. In March 1931, he became Postmaster General, a post he held for five months until August, when the Labour government fell, after failing to agree on how to tackle the financial crisis of the Great Depression. That month MacDonald and a few of his allies formed a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals, leading them to be expelled from Labour. MacDonald offered Attlee a job in the National Government, but he turned down the offer and opted to stay loyal to the main Labour party.\nAfter Ramsay MacDonald formed the National Government, Labour was deeply divided. Attlee had long been close to MacDonald and now felt betrayed\u2014as did most Labour politicians. During the course of the second Labour government, Attlee had become increasingly disillusioned with MacDonald, whom he came to regard as vain and incompetent, and of whom he later wrote scathingly in his autobiography. He would write:\nIn the old days I had looked up to MacDonald as a great leader. He had a fine presence and great oratorical power. The unpopular line which he took during the First World War seemed to mark him as a man of character. Despite his mishandling of the Red Letter episode, I had not appreciated his defects until he took office a second time. I then realised his reluctance to take positive action and noted with dismay his increasing vanity and snobbery, while his habit of telling me, a junior Minister, the poor opinion he had of all his Cabinet colleagues made an unpleasant impression. I had not, however, expected that he would perpetrate the greatest betrayal in the political history of this country\u00a0... The shock to the Party was very great, especially to the loyal workers of the rank-and-file who had made great sacrifices for these men.\n1930s opposition.\nDeputy Leader.\nThe 1931 general election held later that year was a disaster for the Labour Party, which lost over 200 seats, returning only 52 MPs to Parliament. The vast majority of the party's senior figures, including the Leader Arthur Henderson, lost their seats. Attlee, however, narrowly retained his Limehouse seat, with his majority being slashed from 7,288 to just 551. He was one of only three Labour MPs who had experience of government to retain their seats, along with George Lansbury and Stafford Cripps. Accordingly, Lansbury was elected Leader unopposed with Attlee as his deputy.\nMost of the remaining Labour MPs after 1931 were elderly trade union officials who could not contribute much to debates, Lansbury was in his 70s, and Stafford Cripps another main figure of the Labour front bench who had entered Parliament in 1931, was inexperienced. As one of the most capable and experienced of the remaining Labour MPs, Attlee therefore shouldered a lot of the burden of providing an opposition to the National Government in the years 1931\u201335, during this time he had to extend his knowledge of subjects which he had not studied in any depth before, such as finance and foreign affairs in order to provide an effective opposition to the government.\nAttlee effectively served as acting leader for nine months from December 1933, after Lansbury fractured his thigh in an accident, which raised Attlee's public profile considerably. It was during this period, however, that personal financial problems almost forced Attlee to quit politics altogether. His wife had become ill, and at that time there was no separate salary for the Leader of the Opposition. On the verge of resigning from Parliament, he was persuaded to stay by Stafford Cripps, a wealthy socialist, who agreed to make a donation to party funds to pay him an additional salary until Lansbury could take over again.\nDuring 1932\u201333 Attlee flirted with, and then drew back from radicalism, influenced by Stafford Cripps who was then on the radical wing of the party, he was briefly a member of the Socialist League, which had been formed by former Independent Labour Party (ILP) members, who opposed the ILP's disaffiliation from the main Labour Party in 1932. At one point he agreed with the proposition put forward by Cripps that gradual reform was inadequate and that a socialist government would have to pass an emergency powers act, allowing it to rule by decree to overcome any opposition by vested interests until it was safe to restore democracy. He admired Oliver Cromwell's strong-armed rule and use of major generals to control England. After looking more closely at Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, and even his former colleague Oswald Mosley, leader of the new blackshirt fascist movement in Britain, Attlee retreated from his radicalism, and distanced himself from the League, and argued instead that the Labour Party must adhere to constitutional methods and stand forthright for democracy and against totalitarianism of either the left or right. He always supported the crown, and as Prime Minister was close to King George\u00a0VI.\nLeader of the Opposition.\nGeorge Lansbury, a committed pacifist, resigned as the Leader of the Labour Party at the 1935 Party Conference on 8 October, after delegates voted in favour of sanctions against Italy for its aggression against Abyssinia. Lansbury had strongly opposed the policy, and felt unable to continue leading the party. Taking advantage of the disarray in the Labour Party, the Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin announced on 19 October that a general election would be held on 14 November. With no time for a leadership contest, the party agreed that Attlee should serve as interim leader, on the understanding that a leadership election would be held after the general election. Attlee therefore led Labour through the 1935 election, which saw the party stage a partial comeback from its disastrous 1931 performance, winning 38 per cent of the vote, the highest share Labour had won up to that point, and gaining over one hundred seats.\nAttlee stood in the subsequent leadership election, held soon after, where he was opposed by Herbert Morrison, who had just re-entered parliament in the recent election, and Arthur Greenwood: Morrison was seen as the favourite, but was distrusted by many sections of the party, especially the left-wing. Arthur Greenwood meanwhile was a popular figure in the party; however, his leadership bid was severely hampered by his alcohol problem. Attlee was able to come across as a competent and unifying figure, particularly having already led the party through a general election. He went on to come first in both the first and second ballots, formally being elected Leader of the Labour Party on 3 December 1935.\nThroughout the 1920s and most of the 1930s, the Labour Party's official policy had been to oppose rearmament, instead supporting internationalism and collective security under the League of Nations. At the 1934 Labour Party Conference, Attlee declared that, \"We have absolutely abandoned any idea of nationalist loyalty. We are deliberately putting a world order before our loyalty to our own country. We say we want to see put on the statute book something which will make our people citizens of the world before they are citizens of this country\". During a debate on defence in Commons a year later, Attlee said \"We are told (in the White Paper) that there is danger against which we have to guard ourselves. We do not think you can do it by national defence. We think you can only do it by moving forward to a new world. A world of law, the abolition of national armaments with a world force and a world economic system. I shall be told that that is quite impossible\". Shortly after those comments, Adolf Hitler proclaimed that German rearmament offered no threat to world peace. Attlee responded the next day noting that Hitler's speech, although containing unfavourable references to the Soviet Union, created \"A chance to call a halt in the armaments race\u00a0... We do not think that our answer to Herr Hitler should be just rearmament. We are in an age of rearmaments, but we on this side cannot accept that position\".\nAttlee played little part in the events that would lead up to the abdication of Edward\u00a0VIII, as despite Baldwin's threat to step down if Edward attempted to remain on the throne after marrying Wallis Simpson, Labour were widely accepted not to be a viable alternative government due to the National Government's overwhelming majority in the Commons. Attlee, along with Liberal leader Archibald Sinclair, was eventually consulted with by Baldwin on 24 November 1936, and Attlee agreed with both Baldwin and Sinclair that Edward could not remain on the throne, firmly eliminating any prospect of any alternative government forming were Baldwin to resign.\nIn April 1936, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Neville Chamberlain, introduced a Budget which increased the amount spent on the armed forces. Attlee made a radio broadcast in opposition to it, saying:\nIn June 1936, the Conservative MP Duff Cooper called for an Anglo-French alliance against possible German aggression and called for all parties to support one. Attlee condemned this: \"We say that any suggestion of an alliance of this kind\u2014an alliance in which one country is bound to another, right or wrong, by some overwhelming necessity\u2014is contrary to the spirit of the League of Nations, is contrary to the Covenant, is contrary to Locarno is contrary to the obligations which this country has undertaken, and is contrary to the professed policy of this Government\". At the Labour Party conference at Edinburgh in October Attlee reiterated that \"There can be no question of our supporting the Government in its rearmament policy\".\nHowever, with the rising threat from Nazi Germany, and the ineffectiveness of the League of Nations, this policy eventually lost credibility. By 1937, Labour had jettisoned its pacifist position and came to support rearmament and oppose Neville Chamberlain's policy of appeasement.\nAt the end of 1937, Attlee and a party of three Labour MPs visited Spain and visited the British Battalion of the International Brigades fighting in the Spanish Civil War. One of the companies was named the \"Major Attlee Company\" in his honour. In the House of Commons, Attlee stated \"I cannot understand the delusion that if Franco wins with Italian and German aid, he will immediately become independent. I think it is a ridiculous proposition.\" Dalton, the Labour Party's spokesman on foreign policy, also thought that Franco would ally with Germany and Italy. However, Franco's subsequent behaviour proved it was not such a ridiculous proposition. As Dalton later acknowledged, Franco skilfully maintained Spanish neutrality, whereas Hitler would have occupied Spain if Franco had lost the Civil War.\nIn 1938, Attlee opposed the Munich Agreement, in which Chamberlain negotiated with Hitler to give Germany the German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland: We all feel relief that war has not come this time. Every one of us has been passing through days of anxiety; we cannot, however, feel that peace has been established, but that we have nothing but an armistice in a state of war. We have been unable to go in for care-free rejoicing. We have felt that we are in the midst of a tragedy. We have felt humiliation. This has not been a victory for reason and humanity. It has been a victory for brute force. At every stage of the proceedings there have been time limits laid down by the owner and ruler of armed force. The terms have not been terms negotiated; they have been terms laid down as ultimata. We have seen to-day a gallant, civilised and democratic people betrayed and handed over to a ruthless despotism. We have seen something more. We have seen the cause of democracy, which is, in our view, the cause of civilisation and humanity, receive a terrible defeat.\u00a0... The events of these last few days constitute one of the greatest diplomatic defeats that this country and France have ever sustained. There can be no doubt that it is a tremendous victory for Herr Hitler. Without firing a shot, by the mere display of military force, he has achieved a dominating position in Europe which Germany failed to win after four years of war. He has overturned the balance of power in Europe. He has destroyed the last fortress of democracy in Eastern Europe which stood in the way of his ambition. He has opened his way to the food, the oil and the resources which he requires in order to consolidate his military power, and he has successfully defeated and reduced to impotence the forces that might have stood against the rule of violence.\nand:\nThe cause [of the crisis which we have undergone] was not the existence of minorities in Czechoslovakia; it was not that the position of the Sudeten Germans had become intolerable. It was not the wonderful principle of self-determination. It was because Herr Hitler had decided that the time was ripe for another step forward in his design to dominate Europe.\u00a0... The minorities question is no new one. It existed before the [First World] War and it existed after the War, because the problem of Germans in Czechoslovakia succeeded that of the Czechs in German Austria, just as the problem of Germans in the Tyrol succeeded that of the Italians in Trieste, and short of a drastic and entire reshuffling of these populations there is no possible solution to the problem of minorities in Europe except toleration.\nHowever, the new Czechoslovakian state did not provide equal rights to the Slovaks and Sudeten Germans, with the historian Arnold J. Toynbee already having noted that \"for the Germans, Magyars and Poles, who account between them for more than one quarter of the whole population, the present regime in Czechoslovakia is not essentially different from the regimes in the surrounding countries\". Eden in the Munich debate acknowledged that there had been \"discrimination, even severe discrimination\" against the Sudeten Germans.\nIn 1937, Attlee wrote a book entitled \"The Labour Party in Perspective\" that sold fairly well in which he set out some of his views. He argued that there was no point in Labour compromising on its socialist principles in the belief that this would achieve electoral success. He wrote: \"I find that the proposition often reduces itself to this \u2013 that if the Labour Party would drop its socialism and adopt a Liberal platform, many Liberals would be pleased to support it. I have heard it said more than once that if Labour would only drop its policy of nationalisation everyone would be pleased, and it would soon obtain a majority. I am convinced it would be fatal for the Labour Party.\" He also wrote that there was no point in \"watering down Labour's socialist creed in order to attract new adherents who cannot accept the full socialist faith. On the contrary, I believe that it is only a clear and bold policy that will attract this support\".\nIn the late 1930s, Attlee sponsored a Jewish mother and her two children, enabling them to leave Germany in 1939 and move to the UK. On arriving in Britain, Attlee invited one of the children into his home in Stanmore, north-west London, where he stayed for several months.\nDeputy Prime Minister.\nAttlee remained as Leader of the Opposition when the Second World War broke out in September 1939. The ensuing disastrous Norwegian Campaign would result in a motion of no confidence in Neville Chamberlain. Although Chamberlain survived this, the reputation of his administration was so badly and publicly damaged that it became clear a coalition government would be necessary. Even if Attlee had personally been prepared to serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he would never have been able to carry Labour with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940, with Attlee joining the Cabinet as Lord Privy Seal on 12 May.\nAttlee and Churchill quickly agreed that the War Cabinet would consist of three Conservatives (initially Churchill, Chamberlain and Lord Halifax) and two Labour members (initially himself and Arthur Greenwood) and that Labour should have slightly more than one third of the posts in the coalition government. Attlee and Greenwood played a vital role in supporting Churchill during a series of War Cabinet debates over whether or not to negotiate peace terms with Hitler following the Fall of France in May 1940; both supported Churchill and gave him the majority he needed in the War Cabinet to continue Britain's resistance.\nOnly Attlee and Churchill remained in the War Cabinet from the formation of the Government of National Unity in May 1940 through to the election in May 1945. Attlee was initially the Lord Privy Seal, before becoming Britain's first ever Deputy Prime Minister in 1942, as well as becoming the Dominions Secretary and Lord President of the Council on 28 September 1943.\nAttlee himself played a generally low key but vital role in the wartime government, working behind the scenes and in committees to ensure the smooth operation of government. In the coalition government, three inter-connected committees effectively ran the country. Churchill chaired the first two, the War Cabinet and the Defence Committee, with Attlee deputising for him in these, and answering for the government in Parliament when Churchill was absent. Attlee himself instituted, and later chaired the third body, the Lord President's Committee, which was responsible for overseeing domestic affairs. As Churchill was most concerned with overseeing the war effort, this arrangement suited both men. Attlee himself had largely been responsible for creating these arrangements with Churchill's backing, streamlining the machinery of government and abolishing many committees. He also acted as a concilliator in the government, smoothing over tensions which frequently arose between Labour and Conservative Ministers.\nMany Labour activists were baffled by the top leadership role for a man they regarded as having little charisma; Beatrice Webb wrote in her diary in early 1940:\nHe looked and spoke like an insignificant elderly clerk, without distinction in the voice, manner or substance of his discourse. To realise that this little nonentity is the Parliamentary Leader of the Labour Party\u00a0... and presumably the future P.M. [Prime Minister] is pitiable\".\nPrime Minister.\n1945 election.\nFollowing the defeat of Nazi Germany and the end of the War in Europe in May 1945, Attlee and Churchill favoured the coalition government remaining in place until Japan had been defeated. However, Herbert Morrison made it clear that the Labour Party would not be willing to accept this, and Churchill was forced to tender his resignation as Prime Minister and call an immediate election.\nThe war had set in motion profound social changes within Britain, and had ultimately led to a widespread popular desire for social reform. This mood was epitomised in the Beveridge Report of 1942, by the Liberal economist William Beveridge. The \"Report\" assumed that the maintenance of full employment would be the aim of post-war governments, and that this would provide the basis for the welfare state. Immediately on its release, it sold hundreds of thousands of copies. All major parties committed themselves to fulfilling this aim, but most historians say that Attlee's Labour Party were seen by the electorate as the party most likely to follow it through.\nLabour campaigned on the theme of \"Let Us Face the Future\", positioning themselves as the party best placed to rebuild Britain following the war, and were widely viewed as having run a strong and positive campaign, while the Conservative campaign centred entirely around Churchill. Despite opinion polls indicating a strong Labour lead, opinion polls were then viewed as a novelty which had not proven their worth, and most commentators expected that Churchill's prestige and status as a \"war hero\" would ensure a comfortable Conservative victory. Before polling day, \"The Manchester Guardian\" surmised that \"the chances of Labour sweeping the country and obtaining a clear majority\u00a0... are pretty remote\". The \"News of the World\" predicted a working Conservative majority, while in Glasgow a pundit forecast the result as Conservatives 360, Labour 220, Others 60. Churchill, however, made some costly errors during the campaign. In particular, his suggestion during one radio broadcast that a future Labour Government would require \"some form of a gestapo\" to implement their policies was widely regarded as being in very bad taste, and massively backfired.\nWhen the results of the election were announced on 26 July, they came as a surprise to most, including Attlee himself. Labour had won power by a huge landslide, winning 47.7 per cent of the vote to the Conservatives' 36 per cent. This gave them 393 seats in the House of Commons, a working majority of 146. This was the first time in history that the Labour Party had won a majority in Parliament. When Attlee went to see King George\u00a0VI at Buckingham Palace to be appointed Prime Minister, the notoriously laconic Attlee and the famously tongue-tied King stood in silence; Attlee finally volunteered the remark, \"I've won the election\". The King replied \"I know. I heard it on the Six O'Clock News\".\nAs Prime Minister, Attlee appointed Hugh Dalton as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Ernest Bevin as Foreign Secretary, and Herbert Morrison as Deputy Prime Minister, with overall responsibility for nationalisation. Additionally, Stafford Cripps was made President of the Board of Trade, Aneurin Bevan became Minister of Health, and Ellen Wilkinson, the only woman to serve in Attlee's cabinet, was appointed Minister of Education. The Attlee government proved itself to be a radical, reforming government. From 1945 to 1948, over 200 public Acts of Parliament were passed, with eight major pieces of legislation placed on the statute book in 1946 alone.\nDomestic policy.\nFrancis (1995) argues there was consensus both in the Labour's national executive committee and at party conferences on a definition of socialism that stressed moral improvement as well as material improvement. The Attlee government was committed to rebuilding British society as an ethical commonwealth, using public ownership and controls to abolish extremes of wealth and poverty. Labour's ideology contrasted sharply with the contemporary Conservative Party's defence of individualism, inherited privileges, and income inequality. On 5 July 1948, Clement Attlee replied to a letter dated 22 June from James Murray and ten other MPs who raised concerns about West Indians who arrived on board the . As for the prime minister himself, he was not much focused on economic policy, letting others handle the issues.\nHealth.\nAttlee's Health Minister, Aneurin Bevan, fought hard against the general disapproval of the medical establishment, including the British Medical Association, by creating the National Health Service (NHS) in 1948. This was a publicly funded healthcare system, which offered treatment free of charge for all at the point of use. Reflecting pent-up demand that had long existed for medical services, the NHS treated some 8 and a half million dental patients and dispensed more than 5\u00a0million pairs of spectacles during its first year of operation.\nWelfare.\nThe government set about implementing the wartime plans of Liberal William Beveridge for the creation of a \"cradle to grave\" welfare state. It set in place an entirely new system of social security. Among the most important pieces of legislation was the National Insurance Act 1946, in which people in work were required to pay a flat rate of national insurance. In return, they (and the wives of male contributors) were eligible for a wide range of benefits, including pensions, sickness benefit, unemployment benefit, and funeral benefit. Various other pieces of legislation provided for child benefit and support for people with no other source of income. In 1949, unemployment, sickness and maternity benefits were exempted from tax.\nHousing.\nThe New Towns Act 1946 set up development corporations to construct new towns, while the Town and Country Planning Act 1947 instructed county councils to prepare development plans and also provided compulsory purchase powers. The Attlee government also extended the powers of local authorities to requisition houses and parts of houses, and made the acquisition of land less difficult than before. The Housing (Scotland) Act 1949 provided grants of 75 per cent (87.5 per cent in the Highlands and Islands) towards modernisation costs payable by Treasury to local authorities.\nIn 1949, local authorities were empowered to provide people suffering from poor health with public housing at subsidised rents.\nTo assist home ownership, the limit on the amount of money that people could borrow from their local authority to purchase or build a home was raised from \u00a3800 to \u00a31,500 in 1945, and to \u00a35,000 in 1949. Under the National Assistance Act 1948 local authorities had a duty \"to provide emergency temporary accommodation for families which become homeless through no fault of their own\".\nA large house-building programme was carried out with the intention of providing millions of people with high-quality homes. The Housing (Financial and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 increased Treasury subsidies for the construction of local authority housing in England and Wales. Four out of five houses constructed under Labour were council properties built to more generous specifications than before the Second World War, and subsidies kept down council rents. Altogether, these policies provided public-sector housing with its biggest-ever boost up until that point, while low-wage earners particularly benefited from these developments. Although the Attlee government failed to meet its targets, primarily due to economic constraints, over a million new homes were built between 1945 and 1951 (a significant achievement under the circumstances) which ensured that decent, affordable housing was available to many low-income families for the first time ever.\nWomen and children.\nA number of reforms were embarked upon to improve conditions for women and children. In 1946, universal family allowances were introduced to provide financial support to households for raising children. These benefits had been legislated for the previous year by Churchill's Family Allowances Act 1945, and was the first measure pushed through parliament by Attlee's government. Conservatives would later criticise Labour for having been \"too hasty\" in introducing family allowances.\nA Married Women (Restraint Upon Anticipation) Act was passed in 1949 \"to equalise, to render inoperative any restrictions upon anticipation or alienation attached to the enjoyment of property by a woman\", while the Married Women (Maintenance) Act 1949 was enacted with the intention of improving the adequacy and duration of financial benefits for married women.\nThe Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1950 amended the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885 to bring prostitutes within the law and safeguard them from abduction and abuse. The Criminal Justice Act 1948 restricted imprisonment for juveniles and brought improvements to the probation and remand centres systems, while the passage of the Justices of the Peace Act 1949 led to extensive reforms of magistrates' courts. The Attlee government also abolished the marriage bar in the Civil Service, thereby enabling married women to work in that institution.\nIn 1946 the government set up a National Institute of Houseworkers as a means of providing a social democratic variety of domestic service.\nBy late 1946, agreed standards of training were established, which was followed by the opening of a training headquarters and the opening of an additional nine training centres in Wales, Scotland, and then throughout Great Britain. The National Health Service Act 1946 indicated that domestic help should be provided for households where that help is required \"owing to the presence of any person who is ill, lying-in, an expectant mother, mentally defective, aged or a child not over compulsory school age\". 'Home help' therefore included the provision of home-helps for nursing and expectant mothers and for mothers with children under the age of five, and by 1952 some 20,000 women were engaged in this service.\nPlanning and development.\nDevelopment rights were nationalised while the government attempted to take all development profits for the State. Strong planning authorities were set up to control land use, and issued manuals of guidance which stressed the importance of safeguarding agricultural land. A chain of regional offices was set up within its planning ministry to provide a strong lead in regional development policies.\nComprehensive Development Areas (CDAs), a designation under the Town and Country Planning Act 1947, allowed local authorities to acquire property in the designated areas using powers of compulsory purchase in order to re-plan and develop urban areas suffering from urban blight or war damage.\nWorkers' rights.\nVarious measures were carried out to improve conditions in the workplace. Entitlement to sick leave was greatly extended, and sick pay schemes were introduced for local authority administrative, professional and technical workers in 1946 and for various categories of manual workers in 1948. Worker's compensation was also significantly improved.\nThe Fair Wages Resolution of 1946 required any contractor working on a public project to at least match the pay rates and other employment conditions set in the appropriate collective agreement. In 1946, purchase tax was removed completely from kitchen fittings and crockery, while the rate was reduced on various gardening items.\nThe Fire Services Act 1947 introduced a new pension scheme for fire-fighters, while the Electricity Act 1947 introduced better retirement benefits for workers in that industry. A Workers' Compensation (Supplementation) Act was passed in 1948 that introduced benefits for workers with certain asbestos-related diseases which had occurred before 1948. The Merchant Shipping Act 1948 and the Merchant Shipping (Safety Convention) Act 1949 were passed to improve conditions for seamen. The Shops Act 1950 consolidated previous legislation which provided that no one could be employed in a shop for more than six hours without having a break for at least 20 minutes. The legislation also required a lunch break of at least 45 minutes for anyone who worked between 11:30\u00a0am and 2:30\u00a0pm and a half-hour tea break for anyone working between 4\u00a0pm and 7\u00a0pm. The government also strengthened a Fair Wages Resolution, with a clause that required all employers getting government contracts to recognise the rights of their workers to join trade unions.\nThe Trade Disputes and Trade Unions Act 1927 was repealed, and the Dock Labour Scheme was introduced in 1947 to put an end to the casual system of hiring labour in the docks. This scheme gave registered dockers the legal right to minimum work and decent conditions. Through the National Dock Labour Board (on which trade unions and employers had equal representation) the unions acquired control over recruitment and dismissal. Registered dockers laid off by employers within the Scheme had the right either to be taken on by another, or to generous compensation. All dockers were registered under the Dock Labour Scheme, giving them a legal right to minimum work, holidays and sick pay.\nWages for members of the police force were significantly increased. The introduction of a Miner's Charter in 1946 instituted a five-day work week for miners and a standardised day wage structure, and in 1948 a Colliery Workers Supplementary Scheme was approved, providing supplementary allowances to disabled coal-workers and their dependants. In 1948, a pension scheme was set up to provide pension benefits for employees of the new NHS, as well as their dependants. Under the Coal Industry Nationalisation (Superannuation) Regulations 1950, a pension scheme for mineworkers was established. Improvements were also made in farmworkers' wages, and the Agricultural Wages Board in 1948 not only safeguarded wage levels, but also ensured that workers were provided with accommodation.\nA number of regulations aimed at safeguarding the health and safety of people at work were also introduced during Attlee's time in office. Regulations issued in February 1946 applied to factories involved with \"manufacturing briquettes or blocks of fuel consisting of coal, coal dust, coke or slurry with pitch as a binding substance\", and concerned \"dust and ventilation, washing facilities and clothing accommodation, medical supervision and examination, skin and eye protection and messrooms\".\nNationalisation.\nAttlee's government also carried out their manifesto commitment for nationalisation of basic industries and public utilities. The Bank of England and civil aviation were nationalised in 1946. Coal mining, the railways, road haulage, canals and Cable and Wireless were nationalised in 1947, and electricity and gas followed in 1948. The steel industry was nationalised in 1951. By 1951 about 20 per cent of the British economy had been taken into public ownership.\nNationalisation failed to provide workers with a greater say in the running of the industries in which they worked. It did, however, bring about significant material gains for workers in the form of higher wages, reduced working hours, and improvements in working conditions, especially in regards to safety. As historian Eric Shaw noted of the years following nationalisation, the electricity and gas supply companies became \"impressive models of public enterprise\" in terms of efficiency, and the National Coal Board was not only profitable, but working conditions for miners had significantly improved as well.\nWithin a few years of nationalisation, a number of progressive measures had been carried out which did much to improve conditions in the mines, including better pay, a five-day working week, a national safety scheme (with proper standards at all the collieries), a ban on boys under the age of 16 going underground, the introduction of training for newcomers before going down to the coalface, and the making of pithead baths into a standard facility.\nThe newly established National Coal Board offered sick pay and holiday pay to miners. As noted by Martin Francis:\nUnion leaders saw nationalisation as a means to pursue a more advantageous position within a framework of continued conflict, rather than as an opportunity to replace the old adversarial form of industrial relations. Moreover, most workers in nationalised industries exhibited an essentially instrumentalist attitude, favouring public ownership because it secured job security and improved wages rather than because it promised the creation of a new set of socialist relationships in the workplace.\nAgriculture.\nThe Attlee government placed strong emphasis on improving the quality of life in rural areas, benefiting both farmers and other consumers. Security of tenure for farmers was introduced, while consumers were protected by food subsidies and the redistributive effects of deficiency payments. Between 1945 and 1951, the quality of rural life was improved by improvements in gas, electricity, and water services, as well as in leisure and public amenities. In addition, the 1947 Transport Act improved provision of rural bus services, while the Agriculture Act 1947 established a more generous subsidy system for farmers. Legislation was also passed in 1947 and 1948 which established a permanent Agricultural Wages Board to fix minimum wages for agricultural workers.\nAttlee's government made it possible for farm workers to borrow up to 90 per cent of the cost of building their own houses, and received a subsidy of \u00a315 a year for 40 years towards that cost. Grants were also made to meet up to half the cost of supplying water to farm buildings and fields, the government met half the cost of bracken eradication and lime spreading, and grants were paid for bringing hill farming land into use that had previously been considered unfit for farming purposes.\nIn 1946, the National Agricultural Advisory Service was set up to supply agricultural advice and information. The Hill Farming Act 1946 introduced for upland areas a system of grants for buildings, land improvement, and infrastructural improvements such as roads and electrification. The act also continued a system of headage payments for hill sheep and cattle that had been introduced during the war. The Agricultural Holdings Act 1948 enabled (in effect) tenant farmers to have lifelong tenancies and made provision for compensation in the event of cessations of tenancies. In addition, the Livestock Rearing Act 1951 extended the provisions of the 1946 Hill Farming Act to the upland store cattle and sheep sector.\nAt a time of world food shortages, it was vital that farmers produced the maximum possible quantities. The government encouraged farmers via subsidies for modernisation, while the National Agricultural Advisory Service provided expertise and price guarantees. As a result of the Attlee government's initiatives in agriculture, there was a 20 per cent increase in output between 1947 and 1952, while Britain adopted one of the most mechanised and efficient farming industries in the world.\nEducation.\nThe Attlee government ensured provisions of the Education Act 1944 were fully implemented, with free secondary education becoming a right for the first time. Fees in state grammar schools were eliminated, while new, modern secondary schools were constructed.\nThe school leaving age was raised to 15 in 1947, an accomplishment helped brought into fruition by initiatives such as the HORSA (\"Huts Operation for Raising the School-leaving Age\") scheme and the S.F.O.R.S.A. (furniture) scheme. University scholarships were introduced to ensure that no one who was qualified \"should be deprived of a university education for financial reasons,\" while a large school building programme was organised. A rapid increase in the number of trained teachers took place, and the number of new school places was increased.\nIncreased Treasury funds were made available for education, particularly for upgrading school buildings suffering from years of neglect and war damage. Prefabricated classrooms were built and 928 new primary schools were constructed between 1945 and 1950. The provision of free school meals was expanded, and opportunities for university entrants were increased. State scholarships to universities were increased, and the government adopted a policy of supplementing university scholarships awards to a level sufficient to cover fees plus maintenance.\nMany thousands of ex-servicemen were assisted to go through college who could never have contemplated it before the war. Free milk was also made available to all schoolchildren for the first time. In addition, spending on technical education rose, and the number of nursery schools was increased. Salaries for teachers were also improved, and funds were allocated towards improving existing schools.\nIn 1947 the Arts Council of Great Britain was set up to encourage the arts.\nThe Ministry of Education was established under the 1944 Act, and free County Colleges were set up for the compulsory part-time instruction of teenagers between the ages of 15 and 18 who were not in full-time education. An Emergency Training Scheme was also introduced which turned out an extra 25,000 teachers in 1945\u20131951. In 1947, Regional Advisory Councils were set up to bring together industry and education to find out the needs of young workers \"and advise on the provision required, and to secure reasonable economy of provision\". That same year, thirteen Area Training Organisations were set up in England and one in Wales to coordinate teacher training.\nAttlee's government, however, failed to introduce the comprehensive education for which many socialists had hoped. This reform was eventually carried out by Harold Wilson's government. During its time in office, the Attlee government increased spending on education by over 50 per cent, from \u00a36.5\u00a0billion to \u00a310\u00a0billion.\nEconomy.\nThe most significant problem facing Attlee and his ministers remained the economy, as the war effort had left Britain nearly bankrupt. The war had cost Britain about a quarter of her national wealth. Overseas investments had been used up to pay for the war. The transition to a peacetime economy, and the maintaining of strategic military commitments abroad led to continuous and severe problems with the balance of trade. This resulted in strict rationing of food and other essential goods continuing in the post war period to force a reduction in consumption in an effort to limit imports, boost exports, and stabilise the Pound Sterling so that Britain could trade its way out of its financial state.\nThe abrupt end of the American Lend-Lease programme in August 1945 almost caused a crisis. Some relief was provided by the Anglo-American loan, negotiated in December 1945. The conditions attached to the loan included making the pound fully convertible to the US dollar. When this was introduced in July 1947, it led to a currency crisis and convertibility had to be suspended after just five weeks. The UK benefited from the American Marshall Aid program in 1948, and the economic situation improved significantly. Another balance of payments crisis in 1949 forced Chancellor of the Exchequer, Stafford Cripps, into devaluation of the pound.\nDespite these problems, one of the main achievements of Attlee's government was the maintenance of near full employment. The government maintained most of the wartime controls over the economy, including control over the allocation of materials and manpower, and unemployment rarely rose above 500,000, or 3 per cent of the total workforce. Labour shortages proved a more frequent problem. The inflation rate was also kept low during his term. The rate of unemployment rarely rose above 2 per cent during Attlee's time in office, whilst there was no hard-core of long-term unemployed. Both production and productivity rose as a result of new equipment, while the average working week was shortened.\nThe government was less successful in housing, which was the responsibility of Aneurin Bevan. The government had a target to build 400,000 new houses a year to replace those which had been destroyed in the war, but shortages of materials and manpower meant that less than half this number were built. Nevertheless, millions of people were rehoused as a result of the Attlee government's housing policies. Between August 1945 and December 1951, 1,016,349 new homes were completed in England, Scotland, and Wales.\nWhen the Attlee government was voted out of office in 1951, the economy had been improved compared to 1945. The period from 1946 to 1951 saw continuous full employment and steadily rising living standards, which increased by about 10 per cent each year. During that same period, the economy grew by 3 per cent a year, and by 1951 the UK had \"the best economic performance in Europe, while output per person was increasing faster than in the United States\". Careful planning after 1945 also ensured that demobilisation was carried out without having a negative impact upon economic recovery, and that unemployment stayed at very low levels. In addition, the number of motor cars on the roads rose from 3\u00a0million to 5\u00a0million from 1945 to 1951, and seaside holidays were taken by far more people than ever before. A Monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Inquiry and Control) Act was passed in 1948, which allowed for investigations of restrictive practices and monopolies.\nEnergy.\n1947 proved a particularly difficult year for the government; an exceptionally cold winter that year caused coal mines to freeze and cease production, creating widespread power cuts and food shortages. The Minister of Fuel and Power, Emanuel Shinwell was widely blamed for failing to ensure adequate coal stocks, and soon resigned from his post. The Conservatives capitalised on the crisis with the slogan 'Starve with Strachey and shiver with Shinwell' (referring to the Minister of Food John Strachey).\nThe crisis led to an unsuccessful plot by Hugh Dalton to replace Attlee as Prime Minister with Ernest Bevin. Later that year Stafford Cripps tried to persuade Attlee to stand aside for Bevin. These plots petered out after Bevin refused to cooperate. Later that year, Hugh Dalton resigned as Chancellor after inadvertently leaking details of the budget to a journalist. He was replaced by Cripps.\nForeign policy.\nEurope and the Cold War.\nIn foreign affairs, the Attlee government was concerned with four main issues; post-war Europe, the onset of the Cold War, the establishment of the United Nations, and decolonisation. The first two were closely related, and Attlee was assisted by Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin. Attlee also attended the later stages of the Potsdam Conference, where he negotiated with President Harry S. Truman and Joseph Stalin.\nIn the immediate aftermath of the war, the Government faced the challenge of managing relations with Britain's former war-time ally, Stalin and the Soviet Union. Ernest Bevin was a passionate anti-communist, based largely on his experience of fighting communist influence in the trade union movement. Bevin's initial approach to the USSR as Foreign Secretary was \"wary and suspicious, but not automatically hostile\". Attlee himself sought warm relations with Stalin. He put his trust in the United Nations, rejected notions that the Soviet Union was bent on world conquest, and warned that treating Moscow as an enemy would turn it into one. This put Attlee at sword's point with his foreign minister, the Foreign Office, and the military who all saw the Soviets as a growing threat to Britain's role in the Middle East. Suddenly in January 1947, Attlee reversed his position and agreed with Bevin on a hard-line anti-Soviet policy.\nIn an early \"good-will\" gesture that was later heavily criticised, the Attlee government allowed the Soviets to purchase, under the terms of a 1946 UK-USSR Trade Agreement, a total of 25 Rolls-Royce Nene jet engines in September 1947 and March 1948. The agreement included an agreement not to use them for military purposes. The price was fixed under a commercial contract; a total of 55 jet engines were sold to the USSR in 1947. However, the Cold War intensified during this period and the Soviets, who at the time were well behind the West in jet technology, reverse-engineered the Nene and installed their own version in the MiG-15 interceptor. This was used to good effect against US-UK forces in the subsequent Korean War, as well as in several later MiG models.\nAfter Stalin took political control of most of Eastern Europe, and began to subvert other governments in the Balkans, Attlee's and Bevin's worst fears of Soviet intentions were realised. The Attlee government then became instrumental in the creation of the successful NATO defence alliance to protect Western Europe against any Soviet expansion. In a crucial contribution to the economic stability of post-war Europe, Attlee's Cabinet was instrumental in promoting the American Marshall Plan for the economic recovery of Europe. He called it, one of the \"most bold, enlightened and good-natured acts in the history of nations\".\nA group of Labour MPs, organised under the banner of \"Keep Left\" urged the government to steer a middle way between the two emerging superpowers, and advocated the creation of a \"third force\" of European powers to stand between the US and USSR. However, deteriorating relations between Britain and the USSR, as well as Britain's economic reliance on America following the Marshall Plan, steered policy towards supporting the US. In January 1947, fear of both Soviet and American nuclear intentions led to a secret meeting of the Cabinet, where the decision was made to press ahead with the development of Britain's independent nuclear deterrent, an issue which later caused a split in the Labour Party. Britain's first successful nuclear test, however, did not occur until 1952, one year after Attlee had left office.\nThe London dock strike of July 1949, led by Communists, was suppressed when the Attlee government sent in 13,000 Army troops and passed special legislation to promptly end the strike. His response reveals Attlee's growing concern that Soviet expansionism, supported by the British Communist Party, was a genuine threat to national security, and that the docks were highly vulnerable to sabotage ordered by Moscow. He noted that the strike was caused not by local grievances, but to help communist unions who were on strike in Canada. Attlee agreed with MI5 that he faced \"a very present menace\".\nDecolonisation.\nDecolonisation was never a major election issue but Attlee gave the matter a great deal of attention and was the chief leader in beginning the process of decolonisation of the British Empire.\nChina and Hong Kong.\nIn August 1948, the Chinese Communists' victories caused Attlee to begin preparing for a Communist takeover of China. It kept open consulates in Communist-controlled areas and rejected the Chinese Nationalists' requests that British citizens assist in the defence of Shanghai. By December, the government concluded that although British property in China would likely be nationalised, British traders would benefit in the long run from a stable, industrialising Communist China. Retaining Hong Kong was especially important to him; although the Chinese Communists promised to not interfere with its rule, Britain reinforced the Hong Kong Garrison during 1949. When the victorious Chinese Communists government declared on 1 October 1949 that it would exchange diplomats with any country that ended relations with the Chinese Nationalists, Britain became the first western country to formally recognise the People's Republic of China in January 1950.\nIn 1954, a Labour Party delegation including Attlee visited China at the invitation of then Foreign Minister Zhou Enlai. Attlee became the first high-ranking western politician to meet Mao Zedong.\nIndia and Pakistan.\nAttlee orchestrated the granting of independence to India and Pakistan in 1947. Attlee in 1928\u20131934 had been a member of the Indian Statutory Commission (otherwise known as the Simon Commission). He became the Labour Party expert on India and by 1934 was committed to granting India the same independent dominion status that Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa had recently been given. He faced strong resistance from the die-hard Conservative imperialists, led by Churchill, who opposed both independence and efforts led by Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to set up a system of limited local control by Indians themselves. Attlee and the Labour leadership were sympathetic to the Congress movement led by Mahatma Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru, and Pakistan movement led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah. During the Second World War, Attlee was in charge of Indian affairs. He set up the Cripps Mission in 1942, which tried and failed to bring the factions together. When the Congress called for passive resistance in the \"Quit India\" movement of 1942\u20131945, it was Attlee who ordered the arrest and internment for the duration of tens of thousands of Congress leaders and crushed the revolt.\nLabour's election Manifesto in 1945 called for \"the advancement of India to responsible self-government\", but did not mention independence. In 1942 the British Raj tried to enlist all major political parties in support of the war effort. Congress, led by Nehru and Gandhi, demanded immediate independence and full control by Congress of all of India. That demand was rejected by the British, and Congress opposed the war effort with its \"Quit India campaign\". The Raj immediately responded in 1942 by imprisoning the major national, regional and local Congress leaders for the duration. Attlee did not object. By contrast, the Muslim League led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah, and also the Sikh community, strongly supported the war effort. They greatly enlarged their membership and won favour from London for their decision. Attlee retained a fondness for Congress and until 1946, accepted their thesis that they were a non-religious party that accepted Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, and everyone else.\nThe Muslim league insisted that it was the only true representative of all of the Muslims of India, and by 1946 Attlee had come to agree with them. With violence escalating in India after the war, but with British financial power at a low ebb, large-scale military involvement was impossible. Viceroy Wavell said he needed a further seven army divisions to prevent communal violence if independence negotiations failed. No divisions were available; independence was the only option. Given the demands of the Muslim league, independence implied a partition that set off heavily Muslim Pakistan from the main portion of India.\nAfter becoming Prime Minister in 1945 Attlee originally planned to give India Dominion status in 1948, but in the event the Labour government gave full independence to India and Pakistan in 1947. Historian Andrew Roberts says the independence of India was a \"national humiliation\" but it was necessitated by urgent financial, administrative, strategic and political needs. Churchill in 1940\u20131945 had tightened the hold on India and imprisoned the Congress leadership, with Attlee's approval. Labour had looked forward to making it a fully independent dominion like Canada or Australia. Many of the Congress leaders in the India had studied in England, and were highly regarded as fellow idealistic socialists by Labour leaders. Attlee was the Labour expert on India and took special charge of decolonisation. Attlee found that Churchill's viceroy, Field Marshal Wavell, was too imperialistic, too keen on military solutions, and too neglectful of Indian political alignments. The new Viceroy was Lord Mountbatten, the dashing war hero and a cousin of the King. The boundary between the newly created states of Pakistan and India involved the widespread resettlement of millions of Muslims and Hindus (and many Sikhs). Extreme violence ensued when Punjab and Bengal provinces were split. Historian Yasmin Khan estimates that between a half-million and a million men, women and children were killed. Gandhi himself was assassinated by a Hindu activist in January 1948.\nAttlee also sponsored the peaceful transition to independence in 1948 of Burma (Myanmar) and Ceylon (Sri Lanka).\nPalestine.\nOne of the most urgent problems concerned the future of the Palestine Mandate. It had become too troublesome and much too expensive to handle. British policies there were perceived by the Zionist movement and the Truman Administration as pro-Arab and anti-Jewish. In the face of an armed revolt of Jewish militant groups and increasing resistance from the local Arab population, Britain had found itself unable to control events. This was a very unpopular commitment, and the evacuation of British troops and subsequent handing over of the issue to the United Nations was widely supported by the British public.\nAfrican colonies.\nThe government's policies with regard to the other colonies, particularly those in Africa, focused on keeping them as strategic Cold War assets while modernising their economies. The Labour Party had long attracted aspiring leaders from Africa and had developed elaborate plans before the war. Implementing them overnight with an empty treasury proved too challenging. A major military base was built in Kenya, and the African colonies came under an unprecedented degree of direct control from London. Development schemes were implemented to help solve Britain's post-war balance of payments crisis and raise African living standards. This \"new colonialism\" worked slowly and had failures such as the Tanganyika groundnut scheme.\n1950 election.\nThe 1950 election gave Labour a massively reduced majority of five seats compared to the triple-digit majority of 1945. Although re-elected, the result was seen by Attlee as very disappointing, and was widely attributed to the effects of post-war austerity denting Labour's appeal to middle-class voters. With such a small majority leaving him dependent on a small number of MPs to govern, Attlee's second term was much tamer than his first. Some major reforms were nevertheless passed, particularly regarding industry in urban areas and regulations to limit air and water pollution.\n1951 election.\nBy 1951, the Attlee government was exhausted, with several of its most senior ministers ailing or ageing, and with a lack of new ideas. Attlee's record for settling internal differences in the Labour Party fell in April 1951, when there was a damaging split over an austerity Budget brought in by the Chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell, to pay for the cost of Britain's participation in the Korean War. Aneurin Bevan resigned to protest against the new charges for \"teeth and spectacles\" in the National Health Service introduced by that Budget, and was joined in this action by several senior ministers, including the future Prime Minister Harold Wilson, then the President of the Board of Trade. Thus escalated a battle between the left and right wings of the Party that continues today.\nFinding it increasingly impossible to govern, Attlee's only chance was to call a snap election in October 1951, in the hope of achieving a more workable majority and to regain authority. The gamble failed: Labour narrowly lost to the Conservative Party, despite winning considerably more votes (achieving the largest Labour vote in electoral history). Attlee tendered his resignation as Prime Minister the following day, after six years and three months in office.\nReturn to opposition.\nFollowing the defeat in 1951, Attlee continued to lead the party as Leader of the Opposition. His last four years as leader were, however, widely seen as one of the Labour Party's weaker periods.\nThe period was dominated by infighting between the Labour Party's right wing, led by Hugh Gaitskell, and its left, led by Aneurin Bevan. Many Labour MPs felt that Attlee should have retired after the 1951 election and allowed a younger man to lead the party. Bevan openly called for him to stand down in the summer of 1954. One of his main reasons for staying on as leader was to frustrate the leadership ambitions of Herbert Morrison, whom Attlee disliked for both political and personal reasons. At one time, Attlee had favoured Aneurin Bevan to succeed him as leader, but this became problematic after Bevan almost irrevocably split the party.\nIn an interview with the \"News Chronicle\" columnist Percy Cudlipp in mid-September 1955, Attlee made clear his own thinking together with his preference for the leadership succession, stating:\nAttlee, now aged 72, contested the 1955 general election against Anthony Eden, which saw Labour lose 18 seats, and the Conservatives increase their majority. He retired as Leader of the Labour Party on 7 December 1955, having led the party for twenty years, and on 14 December Hugh Gaitskell was elected as his replacement.\nRetirement.\nHe subsequently retired from the House of Commons and was elevated to the peerage as Earl Attlee and Viscount Prestwood on 16 December 1955, taking his seat in the House of Lords on 25 January. He believed Eden had been forced into taking a strong stand on the Suez Crisis by his backbenchers. In 1958, he was, along with numerous notables, to establish the Homosexual Law Reform Society. The society campaigned for the decriminalisation of homosexual acts in private by consenting adults, a reform which was voted through Parliament nine years later. In May 1961, he travelled to Washington, D.C. to meet with President Kennedy.\nIn 1962, he spoke twice in the House of Lords against the British government's application for the UK to join the European Economic Community (\"Common Market\"). In his second speech delivered in November, Attlee claimed that Britain had a separate parliamentary tradition from the Continental European countries that composed the EEC. He also claimed that if Britain was a member, EEC rules would prevent the British government from planning the economy and that Britain's traditional policy had been outward looking rather than Continental.\nHe attended Winston Churchill's funeral in January 1965. He was elderly and frail by that time, and had to remain seated in the freezing cold as the coffin was carried, having tired himself out by standing at the rehearsal the previous day. He lived to see the Labour Party return to power under Harold Wilson in 1964, but also to see his old constituency of Walthamstow West fall to the Conservatives in a by-election in September 1967.\nDeath.\nAttlee died peacefully in his sleep of pneumonia, at the age of 84 at Westminster Hospital on 8 October 1967. Two thousand people attended his funeral in November, including the then-Prime Minister Harold Wilson and the Duke of Kent, representing the Queen. He was cremated and his ashes were buried at Westminster Abbey.\nUpon his death, the title passed to his son Martin Richard Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee (1927\u20131991). It is now held by Clement Attlee's grandson John Richard Attlee, 3rd Earl Attlee. The third earl (a member of the Conservative Party) retained his seat in the Lords as one of the hereditary peers to remain under an amendment to Labour's House of Lords Act 1999.\nAttlee's estate was sworn for probate purposes at a value of \u00a37,295, (equivalent to \u00a3 in ) a relatively modest sum for so prominent a figure, and only a fraction of the \u00a375,394 in his father's estate when he died in 1908.\nLegacy.\nThe quotation about Attlee, \"A modest man, but then he has so much to be modest about\", is commonly ascribed to Churchill\u2014though Churchill denied saying it, and respected Attlee's service in the War cabinet. Attlee's modesty and quiet manner hid a great deal that has only come to light with historical reappraisal. Attlee himself is said to have responded to critics with a limerick: \"There were few who thought him a starter, Many who thought themselves smarter. But he ended PM, CH and OM, an Earl and a Knight of the Garter\".\nThe journalist and broadcaster Anthony Howard called him \"the greatest Prime Minister of the 20th century\".\nHis leadership style of consensual government, acting as a chairman rather than a president, won him much praise from historians and politicians alike. Christopher Soames, the British Ambassador to France during the Conservative government of Edward Heath and cabinet minister under Margaret Thatcher, remarked that \"Mrs Thatcher was not really running a team. Every time you have a Prime Minister who wants to make all the decisions, it mainly leads to bad results. Attlee didn't. That's why he was so damn good\".\nThatcher herself wrote in her 1995 memoirs, which charted her beginnings in Grantham to her victory at the 1979 general election, that she admired Attlee, writing: \"Of Clement Attlee, however, I was an admirer. He was a serious man and a patriot. Quite contrary to the general tendency of politicians in the 1990s, he was all substance and no show\".\nAttlee's government presided over the successful transition from a wartime economy to peacetime, tackling problems of demobilisation, shortages of foreign currency, and adverse deficits in trade balances and government expenditure. Further domestic policies that he brought about included the creation of the National Health Service and the post-war Welfare State, which became key to the reconstruction of post-war Britain. Attlee and his ministers did much to transform the UK into a more prosperous and egalitarian society during their time in office with reductions in poverty and a rise in the general economic security of the population.\nIn foreign affairs, he did much to assist with the post-war economic recovery of Europe. He proved a loyal ally of the US at the onset of the Cold War. Due to his style of leadership, it was not he, but Ernest Bevin who masterminded foreign policy. It was Attlee's government that decided Britain should have an independent nuclear weapons programme, and work on it began in 1947.\nBevin, Attlee's Foreign Secretary, famously stated that \"We've got to have it [nuclear weapons] and it's got to have a bloody Union Jack on it\". The first operational British nuclear bomb was not detonated until October 1952, about one year after Attlee had left office. Independent British atomic research was prompted partly by the US McMahon Act, which nullified wartime expectations of postwar US\u2013UK collaboration in nuclear research, and prohibited Americans from communicating nuclear technology even to allied countries. British atomic bomb research was kept secret even from some members of Attlee's own cabinet, whose loyalty or discretion seemed uncertain.\nAlthough a socialist, Attlee still believed in the British Empire of his youth. He thought of it as an institution that was a power for good in the world. Nevertheless, he saw that a large part of it needed to be self-governing. Using the Dominions of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand as a model, he continued the transformation of the empire into the modern-day British Commonwealth.\nHis greatest achievement, surpassing many of these, was perhaps the establishment of a political and economic consensus about the governance of Britain that all three major parties subscribed to for three decades, fixing the arena of political discourse until the late-1970s. In 2004, he was voted the most successful British Prime Minister of the 20th century by a poll of 139 academics organised by Ipsos MORI.\nA blue plaque unveiled in 1979 commemorates Attlee at 17 Monkhams Avenue, in Woodford Green in the London borough of Redbridge.\nAttlee was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947. Attlee was awarded an Honorary Fellowship of Queen Mary College on 15 December 1948.\nStatues of Clement Attlee.\nOn 30 November 1988, a bronze statue of Clement Attlee was unveiled by Harold Wilson (the next Labour Prime Minister after Attlee) outside Limehouse Library in Attlee's former constituency. By then Wilson was the last surviving member of Attlee's cabinet, and the unveiling of the statue would be one of the last public appearances by Wilson, who was by that point in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease; he died at the age of 79 in May 1995.\nLimehouse Library was closed in 2003, after which the statue was vandalised. The council surrounded it with protective hoarding for four years, before eventually removing it for repair and recasting in 2009. The restored statue was unveiled by Peter Mandelson in April 2011, in its new position less than a mile away at the Queen Mary University of London's Mile End campus.\nThere is also a statue of Clement Attlee in the Houses of Parliament that was erected, instead of a bust, by parliamentary vote in 1979. The sculptor was Ivor Roberts-Jones.\nReligious views.\nAlthough one of his brothers became a clergyman and one of his sisters a missionary, Attlee himself is usually regarded as an agnostic. In an interview he described himself as \"incapable of religious feeling\", saying that he believed in \"the ethics of Christianity\" but not \"the mumbo-jumbo\". When asked whether he was an agnostic, Attlee replied \"I don't know\".\nFurther reading.\nBiographical\nBiographies of his cabinet and associates\nScholarly studies"}
{"title": "Bernie_Sanders", "label": "Politician", "text": "Bernard Sanders (born September8, 1941) is an American politician and activist who has served as the junior United States senator from Vermont since 2007 and as the U.S. representative for the state's at-large congressional district from 1991 to 2007. He will become Vermont's senior senator and dean of its congressional delegation following the scheduled retirement of Patrick Leahy in January 2023. He is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history, although he has a close relationship with the Democratic Party, having caucused with House and Senate Democrats for most of his congressional career. Sanders unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party nomination for president of the United States in 2016 and 2020, finishing in second place in both campaigns. Before his election to Congress, he was mayor of Burlington, Vermont.\nSanders self-identifies as a democratic socialist and has been credited with influencing a leftward shift in the Democratic Party since his 2016 presidential campaign. An advocate of social democratic and progressive policies, he is known for his opposition to economic inequality and neoliberalism. On domestic policy, he supports labor rights, universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, tuition-free tertiary education, and an ambitious Green New Deal to create jobs addressing climate change. On foreign policy, he supports reducing military spending, pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation, and putting greater emphasis on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements. Sanders supports workplace democracy, and has praised elements of the Nordic model. Some commentators, such as Noam Chomsky, have described his politics as aligned with the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and left-wing populism.\nBorn into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, Sanders attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was a protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early to mid-1970s. He was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times. He won election to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont's at-large congressional district, later co-founding the Congressional Progressive Caucus. He served as a U.S. representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006. Sanders was reelected to the Senate in 2012 and 2018. He chaired the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee from 2013 to 2015. In January 2021, Sanders became chair of the Senate Budget Committee.\nSanders was a major candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. Despite initially low expectations, his 2016 campaign generated significant grassroots enthusiasm and funding from small-dollar donors, carrying Sanders to victory against eventual nominee Hillary Clinton in 23 primaries and caucuses before he conceded in July. In 2020, Sanders's strong showing in early primaries and caucuses made him the front-runner in a historically large field of Democratic candidates. In April 2020, he conceded the nomination to Joe Biden, who had won a series of decisive victories as the field narrowed. Sanders supported Clinton and Biden in their general election campaigns against Donald Trump while continuing his efforts to move the Democratic Party in a more progressive direction.\nEarly life.\nBernard Sanders was born on September 8, 1941, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His father, Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders (1904\u20131962), was born in S\u0142opnice, a town in Austrian Galicia that was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now in Poland. Elias Sanders immigrated to the United States in 1921 and became a paint salesman. Bernie's mother, Dorothy Sanders (), was born in New York City to Jewish immigrant parents from Radzy\u0144 Podlaski, in modern-day eastern Poland, and with roots in Russia.\nSanders became interested in politics at an early age. He said, \"A guy named Adolf Hitler won an election in 1932. He won an election, and 50 million people died as a result of that election in World War II, including six million Jews. So what I learned as a little kid is that politics is, in fact, very important.\" In the 1940s, many of his relatives in German-occupied Poland were murdered in the Holocaust.\nSanders lived in Midwood, Brooklyn. He attended elementary school at P.S. 197, where he won a borough championship on the basketball team. He attended Hebrew school in the afternoons, and celebrated his bar mitzvah in 1954. His older brother, Larry, said that during their childhood, the family never lacked for food or clothing, but major purchases, \"like curtains or a rug\", were not affordable.\nSanders attended James Madison High School, where he was captain of the track team and took third place in the New York City indoor one-mile race. In high school, he lost his first election, finishing last out of three candidates for the student body presidency with a campaign that focused on aiding Korean War orphans. Despite the loss he became active in his school's fundraising activities for Korean orphans, including organizing a charity basketball game. Sanders attended high school with economist Walter Block. Not long after his high school graduation, his mother died at the age of 46. His father died a few years later in 1962, at the age of 57.\nSanders studied at Brooklyn College for a year in 1959\u20131960 before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1964. He has described himself as a mediocre college student because the classroom was \"boring and irrelevant\", while the community was more important to his education.\nEarly career.\nPolitical activism.\nSanders later described his time in Chicago as \"the major period of intellectual ferment in my life.\" While there, he joined the Young People's Socialist League (the youth affiliate of the Socialist Party of America) and was active in the civil rights movement as a student for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Under his chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of the SNCC. In January 1962, he went to a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle's segregated campus housing policy. At the protest, Sanders said, \"We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments\". He and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president's office. After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination. After further protests, the University of Chicago ended racial segregation in private university housing in the summer of 1963.\nJoan Mahoney, a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins, described Sanders in a 2016 interview as \"a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn't terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn't agree with.\" He once spent a day putting up fliers protesting police brutality, only to notice later that Chicago police had shadowed him and taken them all down. He attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave the \"I Have a Dream\" speech. That summer, Sanders was fined $25 () for resisting arrest during a demonstration in Englewood against segregation in Chicago's public schools.\nIn addition to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s, Sanders was active in several peace and antiwar movements while attending the University of Chicago, becoming a member of the Student Peace Union. He applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually turned down, by which point he was too old to be drafted. Although he opposed the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought in it, and he has long been a strong supporter of veterans' benefits. He also was briefly an organizer with the United Packinghouse Workers of America while in Chicago. He also worked on the reelection campaign of Leon Despres, a prominent Chicago alderman who was opposed to mayor Richard J. Daley's Democratic Party machine. Throughout his student years, Sanders read the works of many political authors, from Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and John Dewey to Karl Marx and Erich Fromm.\nProfessional history and early years in Vermont.\nAfter graduating from college, Sanders returned to New York City, where he worked various jobs, including Head Start teacher, psychiatric aide, and carpenter. In 1968, he moved to Stannard, Vermont, a town small in both area and population (88 residents at the 1970 census) within Vermont's rural Northeast Kingdom region, because he had been \"captivated by rural life\". While there, he worked as a carpenter, filmmaker, and writer who created and sold \"radical film strips\" and other educational materials to schools. He also wrote several articles for the alternative publication \"The Vermont Freeman\". He lived in the area for several years before moving to the more populous Chittenden County in the mid-1970s. During his 2018 reelection campaign, he returned to the town to hold an event with voters and other candidates.\nLiberty Union campaigns.\nSanders began his electoral political career in 1971 as a member of the Liberty Union Party, which originated in the anti-war movement and the People's Party. He ran as the Liberty Union candidate for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate in the special election for U.S. senator in 1972 and in the general election in 1974. In the 1974 senatorial race, he finished third (5,901 votes; 4%), behind 33-year-old Chittenden County state's attorney Patrick Leahy (D; 70,629 votes; 49%) and two-term incumbent U.S. Representative Dick Mallary (R; 66,223 votes; 46%).\nThe 1976 campaign was the zenith of the Liberty Union's influence, with Sanders collecting 11,317 votes for governor and the party. His strong performance forced the down-ballot races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the Republican or Democratic candidate for those offices from garnering a majority of votes. The campaign drained the finances and energy of the Liberty Union, however, and in October 1977, less than a year after the 1976 campaign concluded, he and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party. During the 1980 presidential election Sanders served as one of three electors for the Socialist Workers Party in Vermont.\nAfter his resignation from the Liberty Union Party in 1977, Sanders worked as a writer and as the director of the nonprofit American People's Historical Society (APHS). While with the APHS, he produced a 30-minute documentary about American labor leader Eugene V. Debs, who ran for president five times as the Socialist Party candidate.\nMayor of Burlington, Vermont (1981\u20131989).\nCampaigns.\nOn November 8, 1980, Sanders announced his candidacy for mayor. He formally announced his campaign on December 16 at a City Hall press conference. Sanders selected Linda Niedweske as his campaign manager. The Citizens Party attempted to nominate Greg Guma for mayor, but Guma declined, saying it would be \"difficult to run against another progressive candidate\". Sanders had been convinced to run for the mayoralty by his close friend Richard Sugarman, an Orthodox Jewish professor of religious studies at the University of Vermont, who had shown him a ward-by-ward breakdown of the 1976 Vermont gubernatorial election, in which Sanders had run, that showed him receiving 12% of the vote in Burlington despite only getting 6% statewide.\nSanders initially won the mayoral election by 22 votes against Paquette, Bove, and McGrath, but the margin was later reduced to 10 votes. Paquette did not contest the results of the recount.\nPaquette's loss was attributed to his own shortcomings, as he did not campaign or promote his candidacy since both Sanders and Independent candidate Richard Bove were not seen as a serious challengers, as Sanders had not previously won an election. Paquette was also considered to have lost because he proposed an unpopular $0.65 per $100 raise in taxes that Sanders opposed. Sanders spent around $4,000 on his campaign.\nSanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders were elected. The Sanders campaign was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as a series of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and the police union. The result shocked the local political establishment.\nSanders formed a coalition between independents and the Citizens Party. On December 3, 1982, he announced that he would seek reelection. On January 22, 1983, the Citizens Party voted unanimously to endorse Sanders, although Sanders ran as an independent. He was reelected, defeating Judith Stephany and James Gilson.\nSanders initially considered not seeking a third term, but announced on December 5, 1984, that he would run. He formally launched his campaign on December 7, and was reelected. On December 1, 1986, Sanders, who had finished third in the 1986 Vermont gubernatorial election, announced that he would seek reelection to a fourth term as mayor of Burlington, despite close associates stating that he was tired of being mayor. Sanders defeated Democratic nominee Paul Lafayette in the election. He said he would not seek another mayoral term after the 1987 election: \"eight years is enough and I think it is time for new leadership, which does exist within the coalition, to come up\".\nSanders did not run for a fifth term as mayor. He went on to lecture in political science at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government that year and at Hamilton College in 1991.\nAdministration.\nDuring his mayoralty, Sanders called himself a socialist and was so described in the press. During his first term, his supporters, including the first Citizens Party city councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party. The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they had enough to keep the council from overriding Sanders's vetoes. Under his leadership, Burlington balanced its city budget; attracted a minor league baseball team, the Vermont Reds, then the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds; became the first U.S. city to fund community-trust housing; and successfully sued the local cable television franchise, thereby winning reduced rates for customers.\nAs mayor, Sanders also led extensive downtown revitalization projects. One of his primary achievements was improving Burlington's Lake Champlain waterfront. In 1981, he campaigned against the unpopular plans by Burlington developer Tony Pomerleau to convert the then-industrial waterfront property owned by the Central Vermont Railway into expensive condominiums, hotels, and offices. He ran under the slogan \"Burlington is not for sale\" and successfully supported a plan that redeveloped the waterfront area into a mixed-use district featuring housing, parks, and public spaces.\nSanders was a consistent critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America throughout the 1980s. In 1985, Burlington City Hall hosted a foreign policy speech by Noam Chomsky. In his introduction, he praised Chomsky as \"a very vocal and important voice in the wilderness of intellectual life in America\" and said that he was \"delighted to welcome a person who I think we're all very proud of.\"\nSanders hosted and produced a public-access television program, \"Bernie Speaks with the Community\", from 1986 to 1988. He collaborated with 30 Vermont musicians to record a folk album, \"We Shall Overcome\", in 1987. That same year, \"U.S. News &amp; World Report\" ranked Sanders one of America's best mayors. , Burlington was regarded as one of the most livable cities in the United States.\nWhen Sanders left office in 1989, Bouricius, a member of the Burlington city council, said that Sanders had \"changed the entire nature of politics in Burlington and also in the state of Vermont\".\nU.S. House of Representatives (1991\u20132007).\nElections.\nIn 1988, incumbent Republican congressman Jim Jeffords decided to run for the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing Vermont's at-large congressional district. Former Lieutenant Governor Peter P. Smith (R) won the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic State Representative Paul N. Poirier placed third with 19%. Two years later, he ran for the seat again and defeated Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.\nSanders was the first independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Frazier Reams of Ohio won his second term in 1952, as well as the first socialist elected to the House since Vito Marcantonio, from the American Labor Party, who won his last term in 1948. Sanders served as a representative from 1991 until he became a senator in 2007, winning reelection by large margins except during the 1994 Republican Revolution, when he won by 3%, with 50% of the vote.\nLegislation.\nDuring his first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues with his criticism of both political parties as working primarily on behalf of the wealthy. In 1991, he co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of mostly liberal Democrats that he chaired for its first eight years, while still refusing to join the Democratic Party or caucus.\nIn 2005, \"Rolling Stone\" called Sanders the \"amendment king\" for his ability to get more roll call amendments passed than any other congressman during the period since 1995, when Congress was entirely under Republican control. Being an independent allowed him to form coalitions across party lines.\nBanking reform.\nIn 1999, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the Glass\u2013Steagall legislation provisions that kept investment banks and commercial banks separate entities. He was a vocal critic of Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan; in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion, Sanders told him he was concerned that Greenspan was \"way out of touch\" and \"that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations.\"\nCancer registries.\nConcerned by high breast cancer rates in Vermont, on February 7, 1992, Sanders sponsored the Cancer Registries Amendment Act to establish cancer registries to collect data on cancer. Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a companion bill in the Senate on October 2, 1992. The Senate bill was passed by the House on October 6 and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on October 24, 1992.\nFirearms and criminal justice.\nIn 1993, Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks when buying guns and imposed a waiting period on firearm purchasers in the United States; the bill passed by a vote of 238\u2013187. He voted against the bill four more times in the 1990s, explaining his Vermont constituents saw waiting-period mandates as more appropriately a state than federal matter.\nSanders did vote for other gun-control measures. For example, in 1994, he voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act \"because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons.\" He was nevertheless critical of the other parts of the bill. Although he acknowledged that \"clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them\", he maintained that governmental policies played a large part in \"dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence\" and argued that the repressive policies introduced by the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, saying, \"we can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails.\"\nSanders has at times favored stronger law enforcement and sentencing. In 1996, he voted against a bill that would have prohibited police from purchasing tanks and armored carriers. In 1998, he voted for a bill that would have increased minimum sentencing for possessing a gun while committing a federal crime to ten years in prison, including nonviolent crimes such as marijuana possession.\nIn 2005, Sanders voted for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The purpose of the act was to prevent firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products. , he said that he has since changed his position and would vote for legislation to defeat this bill.\nOpposition to the Patriot Act.\nSanders was a consistent critic of the Patriot Act. As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation. After its 357\u201366 passage in the House, he sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects and voted against each reauthorization. In June 2005, he proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals' library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority, but was removed on November4 of that year in House\u2013Senate negotiations and never became law.\nOpposition to the War in Iraq.\nSanders voted against the resolutions authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and he opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks. He voted for a non-binding resolution expressing support for troops at the outset of the invasion of Iraq, but gave a floor speech criticizing the partisan nature of the vote and the Bush administration's actions in the run-up to the war. Regarding the leak of CIA agent Valerie Plame's identity by a State Department official, he stated: \"The revelation that the President authorized the release of classified information in order to discredit an Iraq war critic should tell every member of Congress that the time is now for a serious investigation of how we got into the war in Iraq and why Congress can no longer act as a rubber stamp for the President.\"\nTrade policy.\nIn February 2005, Sanders introduced a bill that would have withdrawn the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status that had been extended to China in October 2000. He said to the House, \"Anyone who takes an objective look at our trade policy with China must conclude that it is an absolute failure and needs to be fundamentally overhauled\", citing the American jobs being lost to overseas competitors. His bill received 71 co-sponsors but was not sent to the floor for a vote.\nU.S. Senate (2007\u2013present).\nElections.\nSanders entered the race for the U.S. Senate on April 21, 2005, after Senator Jim Jeffords announced that he would not seek a fourth term. Chuck Schumer, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and fellow James Madison High School alumnus, endorsed Sanders. This was a critical move because it meant no Democrat running against him could expect financial help from the party. He was also endorsed by Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid and Democratic National Committee chair and former Vermont governor Howard Dean. Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who \"votes with the Democrats 98% of the time.\" Then-Senator Barack Obama also campaigned for him in Vermont in March 2006. Sanders entered into an agreement with the Democratic Party, much as he had as a congressman, to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, which he did.\nIn the most expensive political campaign in Vermont's history, Sanders defeated businessman Rich Tarrant by an almost 2-to-1 margin. Many national media outlets projected him as the winner just after the polls closed, before any returns came in. He was reelected in 2012 with 71% of the vote, and in 2018 with 67% of the vote.\nLegislation.\nWhile a member of Congress, Sanders sponsored 15 concurrent resolutions and 15 Senate resolutions. Of those he co-sponsored, 218 became law. While he has consistently advocated for progressive causes, \"Politico\" wrote that he has \"rarely forged actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it.\" According to \"The New York Times\", \"Big legislation largely eludes Mr. Sanders because his ideas are usually far to the left of the majority of the Senate\u00a0... Mr. Sanders has largely found ways to press his agenda through appending small provisions to the larger bills of others.\" During his time in the Senate, he had lower legislative effectiveness than the average senator, as measured by the number of sponsored bills that passed and successful amendments made. Nevertheless, he has sponsored over 500 amendments to bills, many of which became law. The results of these amendments include a ban on imported goods made by child labor; $100\u00a0million in funding for community health centers; $10\u00a0million for an outreach program for servicemembers suffering from posttraumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, panic attacks, and other mental disorders; a public database of senior Department of Defense officials seeking employment with defense contractors; and including autism treatment in the military healthcare program.\nFinance and monetary policy.\nIn 2008 and 2009, Sanders voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a program to purchase toxic banking assets and provide loans to banks that were in free-fall. On February 4, 2009, he sponsored an amendment to ensure that TARP funds would not displace U.S. workers. The amendment passed and was added to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Among his proposed financial reforms is auditing the Federal Reserve, which would reduce its independence in monetary policy deliberations; Federal Reserve officials say that \"Audit the Fed\" legislation would expose the Federal Reserve to undue political pressure from lawmakers who do not like its decisions.\nOn December 10, 2010, Sanders delivered an \u2013hour speech against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, which proposed extending the Bush-era tax rates. He argued that the legislation would favor the wealthiest Americans. \"Enough is enough!\u00a0... How many homes can you own?\" he asked. Nevertheless, the bill passed the Senate with a strong majority and was signed into law a week later. In February 2011, Nation Books published the speech as \"\", with authorial proceeds going to Vermont nonprofit charitable organizations.\nIn 2016, Sanders voted for the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, which included proposals for a reformed audit of the Federal Reserve System.\nForeign policy.\nOn June 12, 2017, U.S. senators agreed to legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia and Iran. The bill was opposed only by Sanders and Republican Rand Paul. He supported the sanctions on Russia, but voted against the bill because he believed the sanctions could endanger the Iran nuclear deal.\nIn 2018, Sanders sponsored a bill and was joined by Senators Chris Murphy (D\u2013CT) and Mike Lee (R\u2013UT) to invoke the 1973 War Powers Resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties and \"millions more suffering from starvation and disease\". After the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 (which was ordered by Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, according to multiple intelligence agencies), his bill attracted bipartisan co-sponsors and support, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 56\u201341. The bill passed the House in February 2019 by a 247\u2013175 vote and President Trump vetoed it in March, saying: \"This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.\"\nHealth care.\nIn mid-December 2009, Sanders successfully added a provision to the Affordable Care Act to fund $11\u00a0billion to community health centers, especially those in rural areas. The provision brought together Democrats on the left with Democrats from conservative, rural areas, helping to secure the 60 votes needed for passage. On May 4, 2017, in response to the House vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, he predicted \"thousands of Americans would die\" from no longer having access to health care. PolitiFact rated his statement \"mostly true\".\nIn September 2017, Sanders along with 15 Senate co-sponsors submitted the Medicare for All bill, a single-payer healthcare plan. The bill covers vision and dental care, unlike Medicare. Some Republicans have called the bill \"Berniecare\" and \"the latest Democratic push for socialized medicine and higher taxes.\" He responded that the Republican Party has no credibility on the issue of health care after voting for legislation that would take health insurance away from 32\u00a0million Americans under the Affordable Care Act.\nAs chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, Sanders has introduced legislation to reauthorize and strengthen the Older Americans Act, which supports Meals on Wheels and other programs for seniors.\nImmigration policy.\nIn 2007, Sanders helped kill a bill introducing comprehensive immigration reform, arguing that its guest-worker program would depress wages for American workers. In 2010, he supported the DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as minors. In 2013, he supported the Gang of Eight's comprehensive immigration reform bill after securing a $1.5\u00a0billion youth jobs program provision, which he argued would offset the harm of labor market competition with immigrants.\nIncome and wealth distribution.\nIn April 2017, Sanders introduced a bill that would raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $15 an hour, an increase over an earlier Democratic $12 an hour proposal. On May 9, 2018, he introduced the Workplace Democracy Act, a bill that would expand labor rights by making it easier for workers to join a union, ban right-to-work laws and some anti-union provisions of the Taft\u2013Hartley Act, and outlaw some union-busting tactics. Announcing the legislation, he said, \"If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.\"\nSanders opposed the 2018 United States federal budget proposed by the Trump administration, calling it \"a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs, and for the wealthiest people in this country\u00a0... nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1%.\"\nAfter the November 2017 revelations from the Paradise Papers and a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies which says just three people (Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett) own more wealth than the bottom half of the U.S. population, Sanders stated that \"we must end global oligarchy\" and that \"we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent.\"\nOn September 5, 2018, Sanders partnered with Ro Khanna to introduce the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, which would require large corporations to pay for the food stamps and Medicaid benefits that their employees receive, relieving the burden on taxpayers.\nVeterans affairs.\nOn June 9, 2014, Sanders sponsored the Veterans' Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs in the wake of the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014. He worked with Senator John McCain, who co-sponsored the bill. His bill was incorporated into the House version of the bill, which passed both chambers on July 31, 2014, and was signed into law by President Obama on August 7, 2014.\nSupreme Court nominees.\nOn March 17, 2016, Sanders said he would support Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, though he added, \"there are some more progressive judges out there.\" He opposed Neil Gorsuch's nomination to the Court, saying that Gorsuch had \"refused to answer legitimate questions\". He also objected to Senate Republicans using the nuclear option to \"choke off debate and ram the nomination through the Senate.\" He voted against Gorsuch's confirmation as an associate justice.\nCommittee assignments.\nAs an independent, Sanders worked out a deal with the Senate Democratic leadership in which he agreed to vote with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless the Democratic whip, Dick Durbin, agreed that he need not (a request rarely made or granted). In return he was allowed to keep his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; in 2013\u201314 he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs (during the Veterans Health Administration scandal).\nSanders became the ranking minority member on the Senate Budget Committee in 2015 and the chair in 2021; he previously chaired the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee for two years. Since 2017, he has been chair of the Senate Democratic Outreach Committee. He appointed economics professor Stephanie Kelton, a modern monetary theory scholar, as the chief economic adviser for the committee's Democratic minority and presented a report about helping \"rebuild the disappearing middle class\" that included proposals to raise the minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, and increase Social Security payments.\n, Sanders's committee assignments are as follows:\nCaucus memberships.\nSanders was only the third senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats, after Jeffords and Leahy. His caucusing with the Democrats gave them a 51\u201349 majority in the Senate during the 110th Congress in 2007\u201308. The Democrats needed 51 seats to control the Senate because Vice President Dick Cheney would likely have broken any tie in favor of the Republicans. He is a member of the following caucuses:\nApproval ratings.\nPolling conducted in August 2011 by Public Policy Polling found that Sanders's approval rating was 67% and his disapproval rating 28%, making him then the third-most popular U.S. senator. Both the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and the NHLA (National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) have given him 100% voting scores during his tenure in the Senate. In 2015, he was named one of the Top5 of \"The Forward\" 50. In a November 2015 Morning Consult poll, he reached an 83% approval rating among his constituents, making him the most popular U.S. senator. Fox News found him to have the highest net favorability at +28 points of any prominent politician included in its March 2017 poll. He ranked third in 2014 and first in both 2015 and 2016.\nIn April 2017, a nationwide Harvard-Harris Poll found that Sanders had the highest favorability rating among all the political figures included in the poll, a standing confirmed by subsequent polling.\n2016 presidential campaign.\nDuring the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, Sanders\u2014dissatisfied with President Obama's \"attempts to trade Social Security cuts for tax hikes\"\u2014reportedly considered running against him in the primaries. Sanders had previously suggested in 2011 that it was \"a good idea\" for someone to challenge Obama, and \"got so close to running a primary challenge\u00a0... that Senator Harry Reid had to intervene to stop him.\" In November 2013, Sanders suggested that Senator Elizabeth Warren could be president and that she might earn his backing if she ran. He added that if no progressive candidate ran, he might feel compelled to do so himself. In December 2014, Warren said she was not running.\nSanders announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party's nomination for president on April 30, 2015. His campaign was officially launched on May 26 in Burlington. In his announcement Sanders said, \"I don't believe that the men and women who defended American democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process\", and made this a central idea throughout his campaign.\nWarren welcomed Sanders's entry into the race, saying, \"I'm glad to see him get out there and give his version of what leadership in this country should be\", but never endorsed him.\nInitially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 primaries and caucuses and around 46% of pledged delegates to Hillary Clinton's 54%. His campaign was noted for its supporters' enthusiasm, as well as for rejecting large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated Super PAC. Some of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails leaked to the public in June and July 2016 showed that the committee leadership had favored Clinton over him and had worked to help Clinton win the nomination.\nOn July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton in her unsuccessful general election campaign against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to continue the \"political revolution\" his campaign had begun.\nCampaign methods.\nUnlike the other major candidates, Sanders did not pursue funding through a Super PAC or by wealthy donors, instead focusing on small-dollar donations. His presidential campaign raised $1.5\u00a0million within 24 hours of his official announcement. At the end of the year, the campaign had raised a total of $73\u00a0million from more than one million people, making 2.5\u00a0million donations, with an average donation of $27.16. The campaign reached 3.25\u00a0million donations by the end of January 2016, raising $20\u00a0million in that month alone.\nSanders used social media to help his campaign gain momentum, posting content to online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and answering questions on Reddit. He gained a large grassroots organizational following online. A July 29, 2015, meetup organized online brought 100,000 supporters to more than 3,500 simultaneous events nationwide.\nTo his surprise, Sanders's June 2015 campaign events drew overflow crowds across the country. When Clinton and Sanders made public appearances within days of each other in Des Moines, Iowa, he drew larger crowds, even though he had already made many stops around the state and Clinton's visit was her first in 2015. On July 1, 2015, his campaign stop in Madison, Wisconsin, drew the largest crowd of any 2016 presidential candidate to that date, with an estimated turnout of 10,000. Over the following weeks, he drew even larger crowds: 11,000 in Phoenix; 15,000 in Seattle; and 28,000 in Portland, Oregon.\nPresidential debates.\nThe Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC's deliberate attempt to protect Clinton, who was perceived as the front-runner. In February 2016, both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten. Clinton dropped out of the tenth debate, scheduled to take place just before the California primary, citing a need to devote her time to making direct contact with California voters and preparing for the general election. Sanders expressed disappointment that Clinton canceled the debate before what he believed would be \"the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process.\"\nPolls and news coverage.\nSome supporters raised concerns that publications such as \"The New York Times\" minimized coverage of the Sanders campaign in favor of other candidates, especially Trump and Clinton. The \"Times\" ombudsman reviewed her paper's coverage of the Sanders campaign and found that the \"Times\" \"hasn't always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate's age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.\" She also found that the \"Times\" coverage of Sanders's campaign was much scanter than its coverage of Trump's, though Trump's was also initially considered a long shot at that time, with 63 articles covering the Trump campaign and 14 covering Sanders's. A December 2015 report found that the three major networks\u2014CBS, NBC, and ABC\u2014had spent 234 minutes reporting on Trump and 10 minutes on Sanders, despite their similar polling results. The report noted that \"ABC World News Tonight\" had spent 81 minutes on Trump and less than one minute on Sanders during 2015.\nA study of media coverage in the 2016 election concluded that while Sanders received less coverage than his rival Hillary Clinton, the amount of coverage of Sanders during the election was largely consistent with his polling performance, except during 2015 when Sanders received coverage that far exceeded his standing in the polls. Studies concluded that the tone of media coverage of Sanders was more favorable than that of any other candidate, whereas his main opponent in the democratic primary, Hillary Clinton, received the most negative coverage of any candidate. All 2016 candidates received vastly less media coverage than Donald Trump, and the Democratic primary received substantially less coverage than the Republican primary.\nAmy Goodman of \"Democracy Now!\" noted that on March 15, Super Tuesday III, the speeches of Trump, Clinton, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz were broadcast in full. Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona, on that date, speaking to a rally larger than any of the others, yet his speech was not mentioned, let alone broadcast. However, political scientist Rachel Bitecofer wrote in her 2018 book about the 2016 election that the Democratic primary was effectively over in terms of delegate count by mid-March 2016, but that the media promoted the narrative that the contest between Sanders and Clinton was \"heating up\" at that time.\nAn NBC/\"Wall Street Journal\" poll conducted in May 2016 found Clinton and Trump (by then the presumptive Republican nominee) in a \"dead heat\", but the same poll found that if Sanders were the Democratic nominee, 53% of voters would support him to 39% for Trump. Clinton and Trump were the least popular likely candidates ever polled, while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating. Polls showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large margin but that those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders. A 2017 analysis in \"Newsweek\" found that 12% of those who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary voted for Trump in the general election, a lower proportion than that of Clinton supporters in 2008 who voted for John McCain.\nDNC email leak.\nIn July 2016, a leak of the Democratic National Committee's emails appeared to show DNC officials favoring Clinton over Sanders. Staff repeatedly discussed making his irreligious tendencies a potential campaign issue in southern states and questioned his party loyalty. DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called his campaign manager \"an \"ass\"\" and \"a damn liar\". Speaking with Jake Tapper on CNN, Sanders responded to the leak, saying, \"it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: the function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates\u2014to be fair and even-minded. But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.\"\nEndorsement of Hillary Clinton.\nAfter the final primary election, Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee. On July 12, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton. He said he would continue to work with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement progressive positions. Sanders refused to formally concede before the convention. He spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton's nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. He responded, \"Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton... It is easy to boo, but it is harder to look your kids in the face if we are living under a Trump presidency.\"\nOn November 8, in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in Vermont, even though he was no longer a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a write-in draft campaign in American history. He also received more votes in Vermont than Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, and Jill Stein, the Green candidate, combined. It was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states, and exact totals of write-in votes for him were published in three of them: California, New Hampshire, and Vermont. In those three states, he received 111,850 write-in votes, about 15% of the write-in votes nationwide, and less than 1% of total nationwide vote.\nPost-election activities.\nIn November 2016, Sanders's book \"\" was released; upon its release, it was number three on \"The New York Times\" Best Seller list. The audiobook later received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album. In February 2017, he began webcasting \"The Bernie Sanders Show\" on Facebook live streaming. , guests had included William Barber, Josh Fox, Jane Mayer, and Bill Nye. Polls taken in 2017 found him to be the most popular politician in the United States.\nIn February 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections concluded that Russians had communicated false information during the primary campaigns to help Sanders and Stein and harm Clinton. Sanders rejected the investigation's conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign. Furthermore, he blamed the Clinton campaign for not doing more to prevent Russian interference. He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign. \"Politico\" noted that a Sanders campaign volunteer contacted a political action committee (PAC) that supported the Clinton campaign to report suspicious activities but that the Sanders campaign did not contact the Clinton campaign as such.\nIn November 2018, the Sanders Institute and Yanis Varoufakis, co-founder of DiEM25, launched Progressive International, an international organization uniting progressive activists and organizations \"to mobilize people around the world to transform the global order and the institutions that shape it.\"\nInfluence on the Democratic Party.\nAnalysts have suggested that Sanders's campaign shifted both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party politically leftward. A new political organization, Brand New Congress, was formed in April 2016 by former campaign staffers. It works to elect congressional representatives with platforms in line with Sanders. In August 2016, he formed Our Revolution, a political organization dedicated to educating voters about issues, getting people involved in the political process, and electing progressive candidates for local, state, and national office. Speaking on the PBS Newshour about the upcoming 2018 elections and discussing the main principles of the two major parties, Susan Page described the Republican Party as \"Trump's party\" and the Democratic Party as \"Bernie Sanders's party\", saying that \"Sanders and his more progressive stance has really taken hold.\" Noting the increasing acceptance of his national single-payer health-care program, his $15-an-hour minimum wage stance, free college tuition and many of the other campaign platform issues he introduced, an April 2018 opinion article in \"The Week\" suggested, \"Quietly but steadily, the Democratic Party is admitting that Sanders was right.\" In July 2016, a \"Slate\" article called the Democratic platform draft \"a monument to his campaign\", noting not only his call for a $15 minimum wage, but other campaign issues, such as Social Security expansion, a carbon tax, Wall Street reform, opposition to the death penalty, and a \"reasoned pathway for future legalization\" of marijuana.\nSanders's presidential campaigns led to a resurgence of interest in social democracy and democratic socialism among millennials.\n2020 presidential campaign.\nOn February 19, 2019, Sanders announced that he would seek the Democratic Party's 2020 nomination for president. He had declined the Vermont Democratic Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018, which caused an unsuccessful legal challenge to his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Along with his 2019 campaign announcement, he said he would abide by a new Democratic Party rule for presidential candidates and that he would affirm his membership in that party. On March 5, 2019, he signed a formal statement, known as a \"loyalty pledge\", that he is a member of the Democratic Party and will serve as a Democrat if elected. News reports noted that the day before, he had signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to his Senate seat in 2024.\nSanders's campaign manager was Faiz Shakir. The campaign's national co-chairs were Ben &amp; Jerry's co-founder Ben Cohen, Representative Ro Khanna, Our Revolution President Nina Turner, and San Juan mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz.\nCampaign methods.\nGiven the high national profile that Sanders maintained since his 2016 campaign, NPR described him as \"no longer an underdog\" when he announced his 2020 campaign. Using the large email list it built during the 2016 campaign, the 2020 campaign recruited more than one million volunteers within weeks of its launch. It enlisted several former NowThis News employees to produce professional videos for wide social media distribution, live-streamed various forums to its millions of social media followers, and launched a podcast and smartphone app for grassroots organizing.\nFundraising.\nSanders's 2020 campaign employed many of the same methods as its 2016 counterpart, eschewing a Super PAC and relying predominantly on small-dollar contributions. According to Federal Election Commission filings, the Sanders campaign had raised the most money in the 2020 Democratic field as of June 2019, including money left over from his 2018 Senate and 2016 presidential races. In September 2019, the Sanders campaign became the fastest in U.S. history to reach one million donors. On October 1, 2019, the campaign announced it had raised $25.3\u00a0million in the year's third quarter, with an average donation of $18. It was the largest quarterly sum raised by any Democratic candidate. The campaign raised $34.5\u00a0million during the fourth quarter of 2019.\nPolls and news coverage.\nSanders steadily polled between 15 and 20% on most national surveys between May and September 2019, according to the RealClearPolitics average. This placed him in a decisive second-place behind Joe Biden until Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris caught up in July. From mid-February 2020 to the start of March, Sanders polled in first place in the Democratic primary ahead of Joe Biden and was described by the press as the party's presidential front-runner.\nAccording to a RealClearPolitics analysis, Sanders received the third-most mentions on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC between January and August 2019, trailing only Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Biden, however, received twice as many mentions as Sanders and Harris. Mentions of Sanders on \"ABC World News Tonight\" found him in second place, though also trailing Biden by a large margin. Online mentions \"reflect a slightly more balanced picture\", with both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren running \"neck-and-neck\" with Biden.\nForums and other appearances.\nOn April 6, 2019, Sanders participated in a Fox News town hall that attracted more than 2.55\u00a0million viewers. His decision to appear on Fox was controversial given the Democratic National Committee's decision not to allow Fox to host any of its debates. His appearance saw an increase of Fox News viewers by 24% overall and 40% in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic, surpassing the ratings of all other Democratic presidential candidate town halls that year. As of September 2019, the town hall had received more than 1.5\u00a0million views on YouTube.\nOn August 6, Sanders appeared on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" podcast. Some praised Rogan for \"hosting a pragmatic discussion\" while others \"seemed rather stunned by Sanders's decision to appear on the show at all.\" After the podcast, Rogan became a top-trending Twitter topic. After interviewing him, Rogan said, \"I am not right-wing\u00a0... I've interviewed right-wing people. I am 100% left-wing\u00a0... Bernie Sanders made a ton of sense to me and I would 100% vote for him.\" As of October 2019, the podcast had received more than ten million views on YouTube.\nPresidential debates.\nIn December 2018, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced the preliminary schedule for 12 official DNC-sanctioned debates, set to begin in June 2019, with six in 2019 and the remaining six during the first four months of 2020. During the July and September debates, commentators described Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as having a \"non-aggression pact\", staking out similar progressive positions in contrast to the more conservative candidates. In the October 15 debate, his first appearance since his heart attack, debate coach Todd Graham gave Sanders's performance an A, his highest rating of all the candidates.\nCNN hosted the first 2020 debate in January with six candidates remaining. Co-moderator Abby Phillip questioned Sanders and Warren about an allegation Warren had made that he had privately told her that a woman could not defeat Donald Trump. Phillip asked Sanders, \"Senator Sanders, CNN reported yesterday, and Senator Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?\" Ignoring Sanders's strong denial, Phillip asked Warren, \"What did you think when Bernie Sanders told you that a woman couldn't become president?\" In an interview after the debate, Sanders called it ludicrous to believe that he would doubt a woman's ability to win the presidency and noted that a woman already \"had\" won the national popular vote, saying, \"After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016.\"\nSuspension of campaign.\nSanders announced that he was suspending his campaign on April 8, 2020. He stated that he would remain on the ballot in the remaining states and continue to accumulate delegates with the goal of influencing the Democratic Party's platform. On April 14 Sanders endorsed Biden. Biden responded, \"I think that your endorsement means a great deal. It means a great deal to me. I think people are going to be surprised that we are apart on some issues but we're awfully close on a whole bunch of others. I'm going to need you\u2014not just to win the campaign, but to govern.\"\nPolitical positions.\nA self-described \"democratic socialist\", Sanders is a progressive who admires the Nordic model of social democracy and has been a proponent of workplace democracy. He advocates for universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, as well as tuition-free tertiary education. He supports lowering the cost of drugs by reforming patent laws to allow cheaper generic versions to be sold in the U.S. He supported the Affordable Care Act, though he said it did not go far enough.\nIn November 2015, he gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including its place in the policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. In defining what \"democratic socialism\" means to him, Sanders said: \"I don't believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down. I do believe in private companies that thrive and invest and grow in America, companies that create jobs here, rather than companies that are shutting down in America and increasing their profits by exploiting low-wage labor abroad.\"\nBased on his positions and votes throughout his career, many commentators consider his political platform based on tax-funded social benefits and not on social ownership of the means of production. Some have described Sanders's political philosophy as \"welfarism\" or \"social democracy\" but not \"democratic socialism\" defined as \"an attempt to create a property-free, socialist society.\" Some members of various U.S. socialist parties and organizations have said that Sanders is a reformer of capitalism, not a socialist. Others distinguish among \"socialism\", \"social democracy\", and \"democratic socialism\", and describe his philosophy as extending from such existing liberal programs in the U.S. as Social Security and Medicare, and more consistent with the social democracy found in much of Europe, especially the Nordic countries. Noam Chomsky and Thomas Frank have described Sanders as \"a New Dealer\". Other observers, such as Lane Kenworthy and Bhaskar Sunkara, suggest that his views are more closely related to those of social democrats.\nSunkara has characterized Sanders's politics as \"class struggle social democracy\", arguing that while postwar social democracy operated as a compromise that instituted tripartite arrangements between business, labor and government to dampen class conflict, Sanders sees social democratic demands as a means to sharpening class confrontation and raising class consciousness. His views have been echoed by George Eaton, arguing that Sunkara's phrase \"captures the nuances of Sanders\u2019 politics in a way that a socialist / social democrat binary does not\" and asserting that if he was elected president it would represent \"the triumph of a politics that is neither wholly socialist, nor social democratic, but a new fusion of both\".\nClimate change.\nSanders views global warming as a serious problem, and advocates bold action to reverse its effects. He calls for substantial investment in infrastructure, with energy efficiency, sustainability, and job creation as prominent goals. He considers climate change the greatest threat to national security. He said that family planning can help fight climate change. He opposed the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the grounds that, like the Keystone XL Pipeline, it \"will have a significant impact on our climate.\" In 2019, he announced his support for Green New Deal legislation, and joined Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Earl Blumenauer in proposing legislation that would declare climate change a national and international emergency.\nEconomic issues.\nSanders focuses on economic issues such as income and wealth inequality, poverty, raising the minimum wage, universal healthcare, cancelling all student debt, making public colleges and universities tuition-free by taxing financial transactions, and expanding Social Security benefits by eliminating the cap on the payroll tax on all incomes above $250,000. He has become a prominent supporter of laws requiring companies to give their workers parental leave, sick leave, and vacation time, noting that such laws have been adopted by nearly all other developed countries. He also supports legislation that would make it easier for workers to join or form a trade union. He was against the Troubled Asset Relief Program, and has called for comprehensive financial reforms, such as breaking up \"too big to fail\" financial institutions, restoring Glass\u2013Steagall legislation, reforming the Federal Reserve Bank, and allowing the Post Office to offer basic financial services in economically marginalized communities.\nBelieving greater emphasis is needed on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements, Sanders voted against and has long spoken against NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China. He has called them a \"disaster for the American worker\", saying that they have resulted in American corporations moving abroad. He also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he says was \"written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street.\" On May 1, 2019, he tweeted: \"Since the China trade deal I voted against, America has lost over three million manufacturing jobs. It's wrong to pretend that China isn't one of our major economic competitors.\"\nForeign relations.\nOn foreign policy, Sanders supports reducing military spending while pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation. He opposed funding Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, in the CIA's covert war against Nicaragua's leftist government. He opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has criticized a number of policies instituted during the War on Terror, particularly that of mass surveillance and the USA Patriot Act. He criticized Israel's bellicose actions during the 2014 Gaza war and U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. On November 15, 2015, in response to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)'s attacks in Paris, he cautioned against Islamophobia and said, \"We gotta be tough, not stupid\" in the war against ISIL, adding that the U.S. should continue to welcome Syrian refugees. He criticized the January 2020 drone assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, calling it a dangerous escalation of tensions that could lead to an expensive war.\nSanders supports Palestinians' rights and has criticized Israel on several occasions. In 2020, he described the American Israel Public Affairs Committee as a platform for bigotry and said he would not attend its conference. He condemned Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, saying, \"It would dramatically undermine the prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement, and severely, perhaps irreparably, damage the United States' ability to broker that peace.\"\nAddressing Westminster College in a September 2017 speech, Sanders laid out a foreign policy plan for greater international collaboration, adherence to U.S.-led international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal framework, and promoting human rights and democratic ideals. He emphasized the consequences associated with global economic inequality and climate change, and urged reining in the use of U.S. military power, saying it \"must always be a last resort\". He also criticized U.S. support for \"murderous regimes\" during the Cold War, such as those in Iran, Chile and El Salvador, and said that those actions continue to make the U.S. less safe. He also spoke critically of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections and the way President Trump has handled the crisis. He does not consider Turkey a U.S. ally, and condemned the Turkish military offensive against U.S.-aligned Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria.\nGun laws.\nSanders supports closing the \"gun show loophole\", banning assault weapons, and passing and enforcing universal federal background checks for gun purchases. In 1990, he was supported by the National Rifle Association in his bid to become a U.S. Representative in exchange for opposing both the competing campaign of Peter Smith, who had reversed his stance on firearm restrictions, and waiting periods for handgun purchases. In 1993, while a U.S. Representative, he voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (which established background checks and wait periods), and in 2005 voted for legislation that gave gun manufacturers legal immunity against claims of negligence, but he has since said that he would support repealing that law. In 1996, he voted against additional funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for research on issues related to firearms, but in 2016, he called for an increase in CDC funding for the study of gun violence.\nSocial issues.\nOn social issues, Sanders has long taken liberal stances. He considers himself a feminist, is pro-choice on abortion, and opposes defunding Planned Parenthood. He has denounced institutional racism and called for criminal justice reform to reduce the number of people in prison, advocates a crackdown on police brutality, and supports abolishing private, for-profit prisons and the death penalty. He supports Black Lives Matter. He also supports legalizing marijuana at the federal level. He has advocated for greater democratic participation by citizens, campaign finance reform, and a constitutional amendment or judicial decision that would overturn \"Citizens United v. FEC\".\nLGBTQ rights.\nHe advocated for LGBT rights as Burlington mayor in 1983 and voted against the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act. In 2006, he indicated that the time was not right for legalizing same-sex marriage nationally, describing the issue as one that should be handled at the state level; but then in 2009, he supported the legalizing same-sex marriage in Vermont, which was enacted that year. In 2014, he signed a letter to then-FDA commissioner Sylvia Burwell requesting that the FDA revise its policy banning donation of corneas and other tissues by men who have had sex with another man in the preceding 5 years.\nTrump administration.\nSanders criticized President Trump for appointing multiple billionaires to his cabinet. He criticized Trump's rolling back President Obama's Clean Power Plan, noting the scientifically reported effect on climate change of human activity and citing Trump's calling those reports a hoax. He called for caution on the Syrian Civil War, saying, \"It's easier to get into a war than out of one.\" In 2017, he promised to defeat \"Trump and Trumpism and the Republican right-wing ideology\".\nSanders gave an online reply to Trump's January 2018 State of the Union address in which he called Trump \"compulsively dishonest\" and criticized him for initiating \"a looming immigration crisis\" by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He voiced concern about Trump's failure to mention the finding that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and \"will likely interfere in the 2018 midterms we will be holding\u00a0... Unless you have a very special relationship with Mr. Putin.\"\nOn January 6, 2021, Trump supporters stormed the United States Capitol. Sanders commented: \"[Trump] has made it clear that he will do anything to remain in power \u2013 including insurrection and inciting violence [and he] will go down in history as the worst and most dangerous president in history.\"\nSanders voted to convict Trump on both articles of his first impeachment trial in 2020 (for pressuring a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden), and again on the sole article of his second impeachment trial in 2021 (for inciting the storming of the Capitol).\nBiden administration.\nSanders strongly influenced the environmental policy of the Biden administration, through the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces.\nAfter Biden was elected president, Sanders became the subject of speculation over a potential appointment as Labor Secretary, which was supported by several progressive groups, such as the Sunrise Movement. For his part, Sanders said that he would accept Biden's nomination if it was offered, but Boston mayor Marty Walsh was chosen for the position instead. When announcing Walsh's nomination, Biden confirmed that he had discussed the position with Sanders, but the two agreed that Sanders's resignation from the Senate and the ensuing special election would have put the Democrats' slim Senate majority at risk.\nOn February 23, 2021, Sanders became the first senator in the Democratic caucus to oppose one of Biden's cabinet picks when he voted against Tom Vilsack's confirmation as Agriculture Secretary, citing concerns about Vilsack's past work as a lobbyist and ties to large corporations.\nSanders strongly supported Senate Democrats' decision to use budget reconciliation (a procedure used to avoid filibusters) to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, despite having criticized Republicans' use of reconciliation to pass their 2017 tax cuts. The bill passed the Senate by a 50-49 vote and was signed into law by Biden on March 11, 2021.\nSanders has continued to have a strong influence on the Biden administration. When it was noted that he had become a key voice in Biden's administration, he replied, \"As somebody who wrote a book called \"Outsider in the House\", yes, it is a strange experience to be having that kind of influence that we have now.\" Their relationship has lasted over 30 years and Sanders has said it is based on respect and trust: \"We have had a good relationship. He wants to be a champion of working families, and I admire that and respect that.\"\nParty affiliations.\nBorn into a Democratic-voting family, Sanders was first introduced to political activism when his brother Larry joined the Young Democrats of America and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1956. Sanders joined Vermont's Liberty Union Party in 1971 and was a candidate for several offices, never coming close to winning election. He became party chairman, but quit in 1977 to become an independent. In 1980, he served as an elector for the Socialist Workers Party. In 1981, Sanders ran as an independent for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and defeated the Democratic incumbent; he was reelected three times. Although an independent, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidates Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988. His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that \"if you go around saying that Mondale would be a great president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite\"), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically. \"The Washington Post\" reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.\nSanders attended the 1983 conference of the Socialist Party USA where he gave a speech.\nSanders first ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988 and for the U.S. Senate in 2006, each time adopting a strategy of winning the Democratic Party primary, thereby eliminating Democratic challengers, and then running as an independent in the general election. He continued this strategy through his reelection in the 2018 United States Senate election in Vermont. Throughout his tenure in Congress, he has been listed as an independent. He caucused with Democrats in the House while refusing to join the party, and continues to caucus with Democrats in the Senate. Some conservative southern House Democrats initially barred him from the caucus as they believed that allowing a self-described socialist to join would harm their electoral prospects. He soon came to work constructively with Democrats, voting with the party over 90% of the time during his tenure in Congress.\nStarting with his 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders's announcements suggested that not only was he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections. When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, \"Of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination.\" Since he remained a senator elected as an independent, his U.S. Senate website and press materials continued to refer to him as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate. In October 2017, Sanders said he would run for reelection as an independent in 2018 despite pressure to run as a Democrat. His party status became ambiguous again in March 2019 when he signed a formal \"loyalty pledge\" to the Democratic Party stating that he was a member of the party and would serve as a Democrat if elected president. He signed the pledge the day after he signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to the Senate in 2024.\nAfter Trump's victory in the 2016 elections, Sanders suggested the Democratic Party undergo a series of reforms and that it \"break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor.\" He drew parallels between his campaign and that of the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election. He wrote in \"The New York Times\" that \"the British elections should be a lesson for the Democratic Party\" and urged the Democrats to stop holding on to an \"overly cautious, centrist ideology\", arguing that \"momentum shifted to Labour after it released a very progressive manifesto that generated much enthusiasm among young people and workers.\" He had earlier praised Jeremy Corbyn's stance on class issues.\nPersonal life.\nIn 1963, Sanders and Deborah Shiling Messing, whom he met in college, volunteered for several months on the Israeli kibbutz Sha'ar HaAmakim. They married in 1964 and bought a summer home in Vermont; they had no children and divorced in 1966. His son (and only biological child), Levi Sanders, was born in 1969 to then-girlfriend Susan Campbell Mott.\nOn May 28, 1988, Sanders married Jane O'Meara Driscoll (), who later became president of Burlington College, in Burlington, Vermont. The day after their wedding, the couple visited the Soviet Union as part of an official delegation in his capacity as mayor. They own a row house in Capitol Hill, a house in Burlington's New North End neighborhood, and a lakefront summer home in North Hero. He considers Jane's three children\u2014Dave Driscoll (born 1975), Carina Driscoll (born 1974), and Heather Titus (; 1971)\u2014to be his own. He also has seven grandchildren, three (including one who was adopted) through his son Levi and four through his stepchildren.\nSanders's elder brother, Larry, lives in England; he was a Green Party county councillor, representing the East Oxford division on Oxfordshire County Council, until he retired from the council in 2013. Larry ran as a Green Party candidate for Oxford West and Abingdon in the 2015 British general election and came in fifth. Bernie Sanders told CNN, \"I owe my brother an enormous amount. It was my brother who actually introduced me to a lot of my ideas.\"\nHealth.\nOn October 1, 2019, Sanders was hospitalized after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event in Las Vegas. His campaign announced the next day that a blockage had been found in one coronary artery and two stents inserted. Scheduled campaign events and appearances were canceled until further notice. Two days later his campaign released a statement that he had been diagnosed with a heart attack. He was released from the hospital the same day. The statement included the following from Sanders's doctors:\nAfter presenting to an outside facility with chest pain, Sen. Sanders was diagnosed with a myocardial infarction. He was immediately transferred to Desert Springs Hospital Medical Center. The senator was stable upon arrival and taken immediately to the cardiac catheterization laboratory, at which time two stents were placed in a blocked coronary artery in a timely fashion. All other arteries were normal. His hospital course was uneventful with good expected progress. He was discharged with instructions to follow up with his personal physician.\nA few days after returning home, Sanders addressed media outside his home and said he had experienced fatigue and chest discomfort for a month or two before the incident; he expressed regret for not seeking medical assessment sooner: \"I was dumb.\"\nSanders made his first national appearance after his heart attack on October 15 at the Democratic debate, at which he said, \"I'm healthy, I'm feeling great.\" When asked how he would reassure voters about his health and ability to take on the duties of the presidency, he said, \"We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.\" It was noted that he was \"lively and sharp at the debate.\"\nIn December 2019, three months after the heart attack, Sanders released letters from three physicians, Attending Physician of Congress Brian P. Monahan and two cardiologists, who declared Sanders healthy and recovered from his heart condition.\nHonors and awards.\nOn December 4, 2015, Sanders won \"Time\"s 2015 Person of the Year readers' poll with 10.2% of the vote but did not receive the editorial board's award. On March 20, 2016, he was given an honorary Coast Salish name, , by Deborah Parker in Seattle to honor his focus on Native American issues during his presidential campaign.\nOn May 30, 2017, Sanders received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Brooklyn College.\nReligion, heritage, and values.\nAs Sanders described his upbringing as an American Jew in a 2016 speech: his father generally attended synagogue only on Yom Kippur; he attended public schools while his mother \"chafed\" at his yeshiva Sunday schooling at a Hebrew school; and their religious observances were mostly limited to Passover seders with their neighbors. Larry Sanders said of their parents, \"They were very pleased to be Jews, but didn't have a strong belief in God.\" Bernie had a bar mitzvah at the historic Kingsway Jewish Center in Midwood, Brooklyn, where he grew up.\nIn 1963, in cooperation with the Labor Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair, Sanders and his first wife volunteered at Sha'ar HaAmakim, a kibbutz in northern Israel. His motivation for the trip was as much socialistic as it was Zionistic.\nAs mayor of Burlington, Sanders allowed a Chabad public menorah to be placed at city hall, an action the ACLU contested. He publicly inaugurated the Hanukkah menorah and performed the Jewish religious ritual of blessing Hanukkah candles. His early and strong support played a significant role in the now widespread public menorah celebrations around the globe. When asked about his Jewish heritage, Sanders has said that he is \"proud to be Jewish.\"\nSanders rarely speaks about religion. He describes himself as \"not particularly religious\" and \"not actively involved\" with organized religion. A press package issued by his office states his religion as Jewish. He has said he believes in God, but not necessarily in a traditional way: \"I think everyone believes in God in their own ways\", he said. \"To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together.\" In October 2015, on the late-night talk show \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\", Kimmel asked him, \"You say you are culturally Jewish and you don't feel religious; do you believe in God and do you think that's important to the people of the United States?\" Sanders replied:\nIn 2016, he disclosed that he had \"very strong religious and spiritual feelings\", adding, \"My spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me.\"\nSanders does not regularly attend synagogue, and he does not refrain from working on Rosh Hashanah, as observant Jews do. He has attended yahrzeit observances in memory of the deceased, for the father of a friend, and in 2015 attended a Tashlikh, an atonement ceremony, with the mayor of Lynchburg on the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah. According to Richard Sugarman, his Jewish identity is \"certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious.\" Deborah Dash Moore, a Judaic scholar at the University of Michigan, has said that Sanders has a particular type of \"ethnic Jewishness that is out of style these days among American Jews.\" His wife is Roman Catholic, and he has often expressed admiration for Pope Francis, saying that \"the leader of the Catholic Church is raising profound issues. It is important that we listen to what he has said.\" He has said he feels very close to Francis's economic teachings, describing him as \"incredibly smart and brave\". In April 2016, he accepted an invitation from Marcelo S\u00e1nchez Sorondo, an aide close to Francis, to speak at a Vatican conference on economic and environmental issues. While at the Vatican, he met briefly with Francis.\nIn popular culture.\nIn December 1987, during his tenure as mayor of Burlington, Sanders recorded a folk album, \"We Shall Overcome\", with 30 Vermont musicians. As he was not a skilled singer, he performed his vocals in a talking blues style. He appeared in a cameo role in the 1988 comedy-drama film \"Sweet Hearts Dance\", playing a man who distributes candy to young trick-or-treaters. In 1999, he acted in the film \"My X-Girlfriend's Wedding Reception\", playing Rabbi Manny Shevitz. In this role he mourned the Brooklyn Dodgers' move to Los Angeles, reflecting Sanders's own upbringing in Brooklyn. On February 6, 2016, he was a guest star alongside Larry David on \"Saturday Night Live\", playing a Polish immigrant on a steamship that was sinking near the Statue of Liberty.\nInternet culture.\nOwing to his two high-profile campaigns in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic primaries, Sanders and his campaigns have generated many Internet memes and other online content. The Facebook group Bernie Sanders' Dank Meme Stash, where users can submit memes focused around Sanders, received significant attention in the 2016 primary season due to the at-the-time unique idea of a meme community focused entirely on a politician. During the 2020 primary season, a still from a fundraising video in which Sanders tells the viewers \"I am once again asking for your financial support\" went viral online, with numerous edits made of the frame. The day before Super Tuesday 2020, a video of the Twitch streamer Neekolul wearing a Bernie 2020 shirt and lip-syncing the song \"Oki Doki Boomer\" also went viral. In 2021, a frame from the inauguration of Joe Biden showing Sanders seated in a folding chair wearing patterned mittens and a jacket reminiscent of the one in the \"I am once again asking\" meme went viral, with the image captioned or edited into other images, most commonly popular movie scenes."}
{"title": "Terry_Sanford", "label": "Politician", "text": "James Terry Sanford (August 20, 1917April 18, 1998) was an American lawyer and politician from North Carolina. A member of the Democratic Party, Sanford was the 65th governor of North Carolina (1961\u20131965), a two-time U.S. presidential candidate in the 1970s and a U.S. senator (1986\u20131993). Sanford was a strong proponent of public education and introduced a number of reforms and new programs in North Carolina's schools and institutions of higher education as the state's governor, increasing funding for education and establishing the North Carolina Fund. From 1969 to 1985, Sanford was President of Duke University.\nAn Eagle Scout, Sanford became an FBI special agent after graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1939. During World War\u00a0II, he saw combat in the European Theater and received a battlefield commission. Following his return to civilian life after World War II, Sanford attended and graduated from the University of North Carolina School of Law and began a legal career in the late 1940s, soon becoming involved in politics. A lifelong Democrat, he was noted for his progressive leadership in civil rights and education, although his opponents criticized him as a \"tax-and-spend\" liberal. Sanford is remembered as a major public figure of the American South after World War II.\nEarly life.\nYouth.\nJames Terry Sanford was born on August 20, 1917, in Laurinburg, North Carolina, United States. He was the second of five children of Elizabeth Terry (Martin) and Cecil Leroy Sanford. His father ran a hardware store while his mother worked as a teacher. The Sanfords enjoyed a middle class standard of living, though their home was rented. During the Great Depression, Cecil's hardware store was forced to close and the family was unable to pay rent, but the company which owned their house allowed them to stay. Cecil struggled to find steady work and performed temporary jobs while Elizabeth returned to full-time teaching. Despite the family's economic troubles, the Sanfords never went hungry and Terry later reflected that he never thought of his family as poor. In the summer of 1930, Terry joined Laurinburg's new Boy Scouts of America (BSA) troop, Troop 20. He advanced quickly through its ranks, and became an Eagle Scout in July 1932. Sanford later reflected that, \"What I learned in Scouts sustained me all my life; it helped me make decisions about what was best.\" He and his brother worked odd jobs to make money in their youth, including raising chickens and pigs, selling vegetables, picking cotton, planting tobacco, and delivering newspapers.\nEducation.\nBy November 1933 Sanford's father had found a new permanent job and purchased a house, and the following year Sanford graduated from high school. In the fall of 1934 Sanford enrolled at Presbyterian Junior College in Maxton. He worked part-time to pay for his tuition and lived at his parents' home while he studied there, but he found the instruction lacking and dropped out after one semester. In the fall of 1935 he enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He worked various jobs to pay for his tuition, including delivering \"The Daily Tar Heel\". He made money in the summer of 1935 by running a summer camp with his friends, and when he returned to the university in the fall he took a job at a campus dining hall. He repeated the same pattern the following year, working the camp during the summer and finding other jobs during his semesters. During his senior year he settled on majoring in political science. The summer after graduating in 1939 he and a friend managed a different summer camp in the mountains, and after the season was over Sanford settled on enrolling in law school.\nWhile studying at the University of North Carolina School of Law, Sanford befriended Professor Albert Coates. He also took an increased interest in student politics, and won a seat in the newly created student legislative council. In that position he chaired the body's ways and means committee until he was elected its speaker. Early in 1941 he found work at UNC-Chapel Hill's Institute of Government, which was managed by Coates. In 1940, as World War II intensified and the likelihood of American involvement increased, the United States enacted a draft, and many students voluntarily joined the Armed Forces. Sanford attempted to get a commission in the Army Air Corps. Though he had earned his pilot's license, the corps determined he was nearsighted and thus unfit to fly. He then unsuccessfully applied to join the Marine Corps and the Navy.\nFBI and military service.\nWith Coates' help, Sanford applied to join the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The bureau waived its requirement of a law degree and admitted him. After completing his semester exams, he began training in December 1941. He was posted as a special agent in Columbus, Ohio and St. Louis. He married Margaret Rose Knight, a woman he had met at UNC-Chapel Hill, on July 4, 1942, and they later had two children: Terry Jr. and Elizabeth. Sanford became bored with his work at the FBI, and pursued a position in the Armed Forces\u2014as the United States had since entered the World War II\u2014being especially intrigued by the new paratrooper units. After securing leave from the FBI, he enlisted in the United States Army on December 7, 1942. He was sent to Camp Toccoa in Georgia for training and was assigned to a medical detachment in the 501st Infantry Regiment. After eight weeks he was made a staff sergeant, and following jump training at Fort Benning he was sent to Camp Mackall and made assistant first sergeant. After a month he was promoted to first sergeant. In 1943 he underwent officer training and became a second lieutenant, and was made a platoon commander in A Company, First Battalion of the 517th Parachute Infantry Regiment.\nIn May 1944 Sanford's unit was shipped to Italy. He first fought in combat against German forces in June in the mountains north of Rome. In August he parachuted into southern France as the leader of B Company, First Battalion in Operation Dragoon. By December he had achieved the rank of first lieutenant. On December 16 the German army launched a counteroffensive through the Ardennes region in Belgium, initiating the Battle of the Bulge. Sanford and his unit were quickly deployed to the village of Soy. On December 26, while his company was holding a ridge line near the Soy-Hotton road, German forces moved into the area. When they approached Sanford's position, he ordered his men to open fire. In the ensuing confusion a German major ran into the American line, and Sanford grabbed him by his belt and captured him. In early January 1945 the First Battalion occupied the town of Bergeval. Two companies then went to reconnoitrer a bluff east of the town. Battalion commander Major William J. Boyle, Sanford, and two other men turned back towards the town to coordinate their forces. Along their route they were ambushed by German machine guns, which seriously wounded Boyle while Sanford was struck in the left hand by shrapnel. In late February the 517th Regiment was recalled to Joigny in preparation for a new airborne operation, but it and subsequent assaults were dropped as Allied ground forces made steady advances over German-held territory. For his service in France and his wounds Sanford was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.\nEarly legal career and Institute of Government.\nAs the European theatre wound down in April 1945, preparations were made to deploy the 517th Regiment in the Pacific War. Japan surrendered before this was done, and Sanford was released from duty. He re-enrolled at UNC Law School for the fall 1945 semester to finish his courses and earn his degree. He graduated in 1946 and took the bar examination; he was admitted to the North Carolina State Bar in November. That fall he also was hired by Coates to serve as an assistant director of the Institute of Government. He held the job until 1948. He then decided to pursue a career as a lawyer, and wanted to establish himself as a leading figure in a community so as to pave the way for a bid to become Governor of North Carolina. He decided to move to Fayetteville, which he thought was appropriately sized as a small city and not too far away from Laurinburg. After moving there in 1948 he worked in Charlie Rose Jr.'s law firm, before setting up his own practice with L. Stacy Weaver. Sanford served as a company commander with the rank of captain in Company K of 119th Infantry Regiment of the North Carolina Army National Guard from 1948 to 1960.\nEarly political career.\nYoung Democratic Clubs and Graham campaign.\nIn the first 1948 gubernatorial primary, Sanford voted for R. Mayne Albright. During the runoff election he supported W. Kerr Scott, and after Scott was elected governor he appointed Sanford to a position in the North Carolina State Ports Authority. In 1949 Sanford was elected president of the North Carolina Young Democratic Clubs (YDC).\nIn March 1949 Scott surprised many Democrats when he appointed liberal UNC President Frank Porter Graham to fill a vacant U.S. Senate seat. In 1950 Graham's seat was subject to a special election. In the Democratic primary he was challenged by conservative Willis Smith. Sanford was friends with Smith's son and respected him, but admired Graham and was \"all out\" for him. As YDC president, he had to keep his public stance on the primary neutral, though Smith's campaign accused him of showing his favoritism. Graham won a plurality of the vote in the first primary, and Smith called for a runoff election. The campaign then took on racial overtones, as Smith's supporters attacked Graham for his support of civil rights. Sanford wanted to improve Graham's support in Cumberland County, and approached Graham's local campaign manager to ask for a precinct he could canvass. He then took a job working in the Cumberland Mills area south of Fayetteville. During this time he kept a notebook where he jotted down lessons he was learning from campaigning. Of the 25 to 30 pages he filled, Sanford reflected, \"I learned one thing. That is, don't ever let them get off the defensive. Frank Graham let them get off the defensive. He was just so nice and sweet.\" Graham won the Cumberland Mills precinct but lost the statewide primary. Sanford shortly thereafter visited Graham and vowed \"to get even, to rectify that injustice.\" His support of Graham provoked the ire of the editor of \"The Fayetteville Observer\", who temporarily barred mention of his name in the paper.\nNorth Carolina Senate tenure.\nIn 1951 Sanford considered a bid to become Mayor of Fayetteville but decided against it and purchased his first house that summer. The following year he ran for a seat in the 10th district in the North Carolina Senate. Facing a former legislator, he won the Democratic primary with 75% of the vote and was unopposed in the November election. He was sworn in on January 7, 1953 and served one term to 1955, deciding not to run for a second term. He served on the judiciary committee, the education committee, the conservation and development committee, and the finance committee, but did not get his desired seat on the appropriations committee. Sanford shared a room with another legislator at the Sir Walter Hotel in Raleigh while the North Carolina General Assembly was in session and worked at his law firm in Fayetteville in the evenings and on weekends. He found his legislative tenure dull and restrictive. He mostly worked on minor legislation affecting local issues, but developed a rapport with several political journalists, who sought him for quotes on their stories about statewide affairs. He supported the creation of the State Milk Commission and introduced an unsuccessful bill to establish presidential primary elections in North Carolina.\nManaging Scott's U.S. Senate campaign.\nWhile in the Senate Sanford befriended fellow legislator Ralph H. Scott, brother of former Governor Kerr Scott. In 1953 when Kerr Scott began mulling a 1954 campaign for the U.S. Senate, Ralph, Capus M. Waynick, and Graham all advised him to hire Sanford as his campaign manager, hoping he could net Scott more young supporters. Sanford temporarily left his law practice and took the job, living off of a bank loan in the interim. Scott declared his candidacy in early 1954. Sanford tried to temper Scott's abrasive public image by preparing uncontroversial speeches for him, though Scott reportedly tore many of these up before attending campaign events. Sanford also assisted Scott in crafting a public stance on racial issues in wake of the United States Supreme Court's 1954 decision in \"Brown v. Board of Education\" mandating the desegregation of public schools. He wrote a polite speech read by Scott insisting on the candidate's support for segregated education and separate but equal schools. Scott's opponent in the Democratic primary, Alton Lennon, attempted to portray Scott as a weak segregationist. When a leaflet ostensibly from a black civic group began to circulate in the last week of the primary emphasizing Scott's appointments of black officials during his time as governor\u2014information that would damage his support among white voters\u2014Lennon's campaign organization claimed it had no connection to them. Sanford recruited a union member to infiltrate Lennon's campaign, and through this was able to discover that it was printing and distributing copies of the leaflets. Sanford leaked the information to \"The News &amp; Observer\", which ran a story on the intrigue. He also called for a federal investigation and sent telegrams to Lennon campaign managers threatening to sue them if they distributed more leaflets. Scott went on to win the Democratic primary and the general election. In 1956 Sanford, at Scott's encouragement, considered challenging Luther H. Hodges in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. He later decided against it and attempted unsuccessfully with Scott's allies to recruit a different challenger.\nGubernatorial career.\n1960 campaign and election.\nSanford began finding supporters and fundraising in preparation for his gubernatorial bid in 1959. On February 4, 1960, he declared his candidacy for the office of Governor in Fayetteville. In his announcement and throughout most of the campaign for the Democratic primary election, Sanford focused on the improvement of education and increased economic growth. In competing for the office of governor Sanford faced Democrats North Carolina Attorney General Malcolm Buie Seawell, state legislator John D. Larkins, and law professor I. Beverly Lake, Sr.. Lake declared that preservation of racial segregation and the state's existing social order would be the main theme of his campaign, worrying Sanford, who wished to avoid race becoming a large topic of discussion in the contest. Larkins and Seawell both ran as fiscal conservatives and moderates on issues of race. As Sanford was expected to place first in the initial primary, Larkins and Seawell focused their rhetorical criticisms against him, while Lake drew upon increasing support for his segregationist stances. Sanford resorted to only minor criticisms of his opponents. Voter turnout in the May primary broke all previous records for turnout in state primary elections. Sanford placed first with 269,563 votes, Lake placed second with 181,692 votes, and both Larkins and Seawell earned less than 20 percent of the votes.\nIn declaring that he would contest Sanford in the Democratic primary runoff, Lake insisted that he liked Sanford personally but disapproved of his economic and racial policies. He criticized his opponent as a proponent of a \"spend and tax\" platform and pledged to oppose the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and ensure that schools remained segregated. Feeling he could not afford to be too polite in his response, Sanford countered with unexpected hostility, saying \"Let's get this straight right now on the race issue...I have been and will continue to oppose to the end domination or direction by the NAACP. Professor Lake is bringing on integration when he stirs this up. I don't believe in playing race against race or group against group.\" He further accused Lake of attempting to secure support by ruining race relations and assured that he could stave off federally-mandated integration whereas Lake would generate a confrontation that would hasten it. He also attacked Lake's professional background, insisting \"I was raised around the cotton patches and tobacco fields of Scotland County, and I know how to handle the racial situation better than a theoretical college professor.\" He contended that Lake's focus on racial matters distracted from the more important subject of quality education. Lake was blindsided by Sanford's reply, and increased his rhetorical attacks on Sanford in the following weeks, including accusing Sanford of having the near-total support of the \"Negro bloc vote\", a charge which Sanford disputed.\nSanford garnered Seawell's endorsement and the quiet backing of Governor Hodges. He also cultivated a strong campaign organization\u2014bolstered by the connections he had made during Scott's 1954 Senate campaign\u2014and garnered the support of labor unions and education lobbyists. His network included the Branchhead Boys (Scott's old supporters), Jaycees, and Young Democratic Clubs; he avoided relying on the traditional courthouse cliques. Winston-Salem businessman Bert Bennett, Sanford's friend and former classmate at UNC-Chapel Hill, provided critical leadership to his campaign and lined up key support behind him. Sanford was also innovative in the use of media consultants and polling data, being the first North Carolinian gubernatorial candidate to hire a pollster and prolifically use television advertisements. He ran as a progressive, but tried to avoid being labeled too liberal on issues of race. Businessmen and professionals who feared that Lake's positions on race would be unfavorable to North Carolina's economy backed Sanford. Sanford ultimately won the June 27 Democratic primary with a large lead, earning 352,133 votes in contrast to Lake's 275,905. Lake subsequently pledged his support to Sanford, but did little to assist his campaign in the upcoming general election. Sanford's victory over Lake in the 1960 gubernatorial election was one of two instances in which a racial moderate defeated a staunch segregationist in a Southern state-wide race between 1957 and 1973.\nMeanwhile, preparations were underway for the 1960 Democratic National Convention in July. While most Southern politicians declared their support for Senator Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas for the party's nomination in the 1960 United States presidential election, Sanford considered backing Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts, the favorite to win the nomination. At the convention he endorsed Kennedy, bringing the senator more support from the North Carolina Democratic delegation than any other Southern state but angering Hodges and some of his own supporters and stoking division in the state Democratic Party. Kennedy ultimately secured the nomination and welcomed Johnson into his campaign as the vice presidential nominee.\nSanford faced a strong opponent for the governor's race in Robert L. Gavin, a moderate conservative Republican attorney. Gavin denounced Sanford as a tool of the liberal leadership of the national Democratic Party and organized labor. Although his reputation had been harmed by his early endorsement of Kennedy, Sanford enthusiastically campaigned for the two of them. He attacked Gavin for contradicting himself on several occasions and for displaying a lack of familiarity with certain issues. In the November election both Kennedy and Sanford won the offices they sought. Kennedy won the popular vote in North Carolina by a small but solid margin. Sanford won with 54.3 percent of the vote, 131,000 votes over Gavin, but his performance was lackluster for a Democrat seeking state office at the time. Sanford remained proud of his gubernatorial victory for the rest of his life, feeling he had defeated a racist candidate (Lake) and avenged Graham's loss in 1950. Out of appreciation for Sanford's contribution to his campaign, Kennedy appointed Hodges to his cabinet as United States Secretary of Commerce. Sanford arranged for Bennett to assume the chairmanship North Carolina Democratic Party. In that capacity, Bennett organized continued backing for Sanford within the party and eased the way for many of Sanford's supporters to advance in its ranks.\nSanford was sworn in as Governor on January 5, 1961. In his inaugural address he declared, \"There is a new day in North Carolina!...Gone are the shackles. Gone are the limitations. Gone are the overwhelming obstacles. North Carolina is on the move and we intend to stay on the move.\" He became the youngest governor in North Carolina since Charles B. Aycock and the first born in the 20th century. In order to avoid conflicts of interest, he shuttered his law firm and resigned from the board of an insurance company, though he retained his chairmanship of the board of Methodist College.\nEducation.\nIn 1960, North Carolina spent $237 per pupil in public school (as opposed to New York's $562), paid some of the lowest salaries in the country to its teachers, had overcrowded high school classes, and had the lowest average number of years of education among its residents in the United States. Sanford believed that improved statewide education would raise North Carolina's low average wages. In his inaugural address, he affirmed his wish to increase spending for the purpose, saying, \"If it takes more taxes to give our children this quality education, we must face that fact and provide the money. We must never lose sight of the fact that our children are our best investment. This is no age for the faint of heart.\" Sanford spent the first few months of his time in office lobbying for a legislative plan to increase state spending on education.\nThe centerpiece of Sanford's education platform was the Quality Education Program, which called for a 22% increase in average teacher pay, 33% more funds for instructional supplies, and a 100% increase in school library money. Sanford initially had difficulty figuring out how to fund his proposal, as the state already levied comparatively high income and corporate taxes, and a luxury tax on goods such as tobacco and soft drinks was likely to upset much of the populace. Many other elected state officials were fiscally conservative, and were likely to oppose any significant borrowing of money and raising debts. Thus, at the end of February 1961, Sanford decided to fund his proposals through the elimination of exemptions of the state's 3% sales tax on certain goods, including food and prescription drugs. The advanced taxes were controversial, and the conservative General Assembly was hesitant to pass them into law. Upon the convening of the General Assembly in March many legislators commented in private that the proposal was doomed to fail. Liberals and journalists criticized it as unfair to the poor, who would be hurt the most by a tax on food. Despite these doubts, Sanford had the good faith of legislative leaders, being friends with Lieutenant Governor Harvey Cloyd Philpott and working on building a relationship with Speaker of the State House of Representatives Joseph M. Hunt Jr.. He appointed former state senator William Copeland as his chief legislative aide who, though a conservative who had opposed increased school appropriations in the past, was well-acquainted with the General Assembly and was prepared to loyally serve the governor's interests.\nSanford promoted his plan through a series of rallies across the state, one of which was broadcast on radio. He argued that North Carolina trailed most other states with respect to education and that the exemptions elimination was more acceptable than a 1% tax increase on all other items. He also intensively lobbied state legislators, inviting them to breakfast at the Governor's Mansion and visiting them at the Sir Walter Hotel, where most of them stayed while the General Assembly was in session. Aside from arguing for his program, Sanford granted political favors in exchange for support. He also actively challenged his critics to think of a better way to fund the education plan. Members of the press and disgruntled liberals backed down when they realized that without the new levy the education expansions would have to be scaled down.\nSanford's effort was ultimately successful and the General Assembly implemented his program and the taxes. Average teacher salaries for North Carolina quickly rose from 39th to 32nd among the states, and per-pupil expenditures rose from 45th to 38th. Sanford's successful lobbying gained national attention. He was subsequently invited to numerous events around the country to speak about his education plan, and he visited thirty states. The increase in taxes was nevertheless poorly received in North Carolina and resulted in a backlash; in November 1961 the electorate rejected 10 state bond proposals in a referendum\u2014the first time a bond had been turned down since 1924\u2014and a public opinion poll found that three fifths of the population disapproved of Sanford's performance as Governor. The referendum defeat demoralized greatly Sanford's staff. Though upset with the outcome and unapologetic in supporting the bonds, Sanford insisted on moving past the failure and focusing his attention elsewhere. In the 1962 elections the Democrats lost seats in the State House of Representatives. Sanford was disappointed, but he remained convinced that the tax proposal was the best way to fund his program and refused to heed calls to alter it.\nIn 1961 Sanford also appointed a Governor's Commission on Education Beyond the High School under the leadership of Irving E. Carlyle. The commission produced a set of proposals in August 1962 aimed at increasing college enrollment in North Carolina. One of its recommendations was the consolidation of the state's \"public junior colleges\" and \"industrial education centers\" under a single system of community colleges. In May 1963 the General Assembly responded by creating a Department of Community Colleges under the State Board of Education. Sanford conceived the idea for the Governor's School of North Carolina, a publicly funded six-week residential summer program for gifted high school students in the state. He established the North Carolina School of the Arts to keep talented students \"in the fields of music, drama, the dance and allied performing arts, at both the high school and college levels of instruction\" in their home state. He convinced the General Assembly to pass the measure to found the institution through logrolling and the promises of appointments to state offices.\nSanford's policies ultimately resulted in the near-doubling of North Carolina's expenditures on public schools and the hiring of 2,800 additional teachers. However, he struggled to ensure the state's educational funding maintained parity with other states and matched with inflation. Despite convincing the legislature to appropriate an additional $50 million towards public schools during the 1963 session, by the end of his tenure North Carolina's national rankings in educational expenditures had fallen.\nNorth Carolina Fund.\nFeeling that his education program had spent most of his political capital in the legislature, Sanford began seeking private support to fund anti-poverty efforts in North Carolina. While traveling across the state to promote his education plan, Sanford came to be of the belief that much of the poverty in North Carolina was due to racial discrimination and the lack of economic opportunity for blacks. He thus concluded that any anti-poverty plan he created would have to address economic problems for both blacks and whites. In the summer of 1962 he met John Ehle, a novelist and professor whom he quickly took on as an adviser on public policy. With Ehle he met with leaders of the Ford Foundation, a private philanthropic organization, and discussed a variety of issues with them, including anti-poverty efforts. He also established contact with George Esser, an academic at UNC-Chapel Hill's Institute of Government, to ask him for potential uses of Ford Foundation funds in combating poverty. Sanford's aides organized a three-day tour of North Carolina in January 1963 for Ford Foundation leaders to convince them to fund an anti-poverty project. Sanford's attempts to devise a plan became increasingly urgent over the following months, as civil rights activists intensified their calls for racial equality and the prospects of a white backlash grew. He worked to secure the support of the Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation and the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation, two smaller North Carolina philanthropic organizations, to bolster proposed grants from the Ford Foundation, and tapped the advice of John H. Wheeler, leader of the black business community in Durham. He also invited officials from the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare to come to North Carolina to work on coordinating federal efforts with the state project.\nIn July 1963 the Ford Foundation committed $7 million to support an anti-poverty project in North Carolina. With additional grants from the other foundations, on July 18 Sanford, Wheeler, Charlie Babcock (a board member of the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation), and C. A. McKnight (the editor of \"The Charlotte Observer\") incorporated the North Carolina Fund. Its goals were to fight poverty and promote racial equality across the state. Since the North Carolina Fund was backed by private organizations and not financed by the state, it could be more flexible in addressing social issues while also avoiding political opposition from segregationists. Sanford was made chairman of the Fund's board. He publicly announced its creation at a press conference on September 30, garnering a positive reception from state newspapers. The organisation had a racially integrated staff\u2014which was unusual at the time\u2014and consulted the local residents it aimed to assist. The Fund launched a program that utilized team teaching and provided for teacher aides, which was studied by President Johnson's administration and used as a model for Head Start. The Fund also supported eleven additional anti-poverty programs under another initiative which included the establishment of day care facilities and job training courses. These were also evaluated by the Johnson administration when it developed its \"War on Poverty\" programs. Sanford himself was disappointed by Johnson's War on Poverty and the agency responsible for it, the Office of Economic Opportunity, and told federal officials that the goal of their effort should not be to eliminate poverty\u2014which Sanford thought impossible\u2014as much as it should be to reduce the \"causes of poverty.\" Johnson administration officials considered placing Sanford in charge of the office. The Fund ceased operations in 1969.\nRace relations and civil rights.\nAt the time Sanford entered gubernatorial office, the state of racial affairs in North Carolina was essentially the same as it had been since the early 1900s. Segregation was common; despite token integration efforts in some urban schools and state colleges, 99 percent of black school children attended segregated schools, and though federal courts had mandated the integration of buses and trains, transit stations and most other accommodations\u2014hotels, restaurants, movie theaters, public parks, and beaches\u2014remained segregated. According to the North Carolina Advisory Commission on Civil Rights, only 31.2 percent of potential nonwhite voters were registered to vote, in contrast to 90.2 percent of white voters. In his inaugural address, Sanford appealed for mutual respect and understanding between races and said that \"no group of our citizens can be denied the right to participate in the opportunities of first-class citizenship.\" He enrolled his daughter Betsee and his son Terry in the integrated Murphy School (it was attended by a single black student), an action which received attention in the state and national press.\nSanford had considered racism to be immoral since he was student at the University of North Carolina, but initially wished to avoid dealing with issues of racial equality directly as governor, viewing it as a distraction from his main platform and politically dangerous. He had no planned strategy or agenda for the issue. However, he soon felt that as governor he had to take some action to address the growing tension in the United States due to the increasing activity of the civil rights movement. Shortly after taking office, he began appointing black professionals to state offices. Ultimately, he placed over three dozen blacks on state boards, commissions, and committees. He also consulted black community and business leaders on civil rights issues such as Wheeler, sociologist John R. Larkins, and real estate developer John W. Winters. Winters was particularly insistent on encouraging Sanford and his staff to reconsider their views on civil rights. In 1961 Sanford and the chairman of the Board of Conservation and Development, Skipper Bowles, decided to integrate North Carolina's state parks. Sanford generally believed that the use of persuasion and appeals to decency instead of invoking the law and employing force would mollify segregationists and lead to social change. He thought that the \"basic goodness of people\" would prevail in racial matters, and was often disappointed to encounter hostility from North Carolinians opposed to desegregation.\nIn May 1961 a multiracial group of civil rights activists known as Freedom Riders prepared to enter North Carolina on intercity buses to ensure the desegregation of them and related transit facilities in the South. Sanford sought the advice of Thomas J. Pearsall, an attorney who had previously developed North Carolina's response to federally mandated school desegregation. Pearsall counselled Sanford to \"approach the matter quietly, informally and without public notice\" and be prepared to deploy the State Highway Patrol to \"meet mob violence.\" Under Sanford's orders, the Highway Patrol monitored the buses' movements and guarded against potential violence from angry segregationist whites. Throughout his tenure Sanford would deploy state police at civil rights demonstrations to maintain order and deter violence, but he never used them to disperse demonstrators. He later said, \"It was up to us to keep the order and let them demonstrate, which was constitutional. It was unthinkable to put them in jail for that.\" He also expressed support for President Kennedy's actions to maintain order during the integration of the University of Mississippi. Sanford remained conscious of the desires of the white constituency which had elected him, and in one instance wrote federal officials to request that a group of white North Carolinian army reservists be reassigned from the predominantly black army unit to which they were posted. Sanford let the matter drop after the United States Department of Defense refused to honor his request. Journalists often wrote about Sanford's actions regarding racial issues and dubbed him a leading moderate. He enjoyed the media attention, but shied away from being portrayed as party to a conflict with the South's more hard-line segregationist governors.\nSanford's cautious stance on civil rights and racial issues began to change while he traveled across North Carolina to visit schools to promote his education program. Sanford visited both white and black schools and, while touring them, encouraged the students to pursue their own education as means of securing economic prosperity in the future. Over time he grew uncomfortable saying this to black schoolchildren, and on one occasion after a meeting with black students, he felt ill and refused to eat dinner. He later explained his trouble, saying \"I had the sickening feeling that every time I talked to them I was saying words that were a mockery...I was talking about opportunities that I knew, and I feared they knew, didn't exist, no matter how hard they might work in school.\" Sanford was also moved to reconsider his views after investigating the source of financial support for black college students who remained in Raleigh during the summer after the end of their academic semester to protest segregation. He wrote, \"I was amazed to discover that their support came from the local older Negro...Incredibly, these local older Negroes had been dissatisfied all the time...and they were intensively, if secretly, proud of the young Negroes who were militantly insisting on change.\"\nOnce resolved that he had to take more action to support racial equality, Sanford began making statements in favor of it. In October 1962, he told a gathering of Methodists in Rutherford County that poverty in North Carolina was worsened by the lack of economic opportunity for blacks and told the audience that whites would have to handle the \"difficult problems of race\" in a \"spirit of Christian fellowship\". The address drew a mediocre response from the crowd and generated little attention in the state media. In early 1963 he began drafting a speech entitled \"Observations for a Second Century\" which directly called for the support of civil rights. Sanford shared his work with over 100 of his associates; most were supportive of his aims, but others feared the consequences his statement would have on the Democratic Party. On January 18, 1963, Sanford delivered his address at the Carolina Inn before the North Carolina Press Association. After making an aside to the journalists, Sanford delved into his prepared remarks:\nThe statement made Sanford the first Southern governor to call for the end of racially discriminatory employment. The same day Sanford announced the creation of the Good Neighbor Council, a biracial panel aimed at developing voluntary nondiscriminatory hiring practices and encouraging youth to prepare for gainful employment. The council did not have any provision to enforce its recommendations and thus its impact was minimal. Sanford also requested that the heads of state agencies adopt nondiscriminatory hiring policies and supported a bill that reduced racial barriers in the North Carolina National Guard. Ultimately, Sanford's attempts at reform did not significantly alter employment dynamics in the state and only benefited a minority of blacks. The racial integration of public schools also made little progress during his tenure.\nMany young black people felt Sanford was not doing enough to address their concerns. In May 1963, 500 black student demonstrators gathered on the lawn of the Governor's Mansion and chanted for the governor to come out. Sanford, who was hosting a black tie fundraising event for the North Carolina Symphony, stepped onto the south porch of the house. He stood annoyed as the protesters jeered him, before saying, \"I'll be glad to talk to you about any of your problems, any of your grievances, any of your hopes. This is not the time, or the place.\" He also added, \"If you want to talk to me at any time about your plans and your problems, let my office know. You have not come to me with any requests.\" When one of the demonstrators yelled that Sanford should have already been aware of their grievances without any specific requests, Sanford responded, \"I'm not dictator, son. You're in a democracy.\" The group booed him and eventually left the premises.\nIn late May and early June, four hundred black students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College in Greensboro were arrested for breaking segregationist practices in cafeterias and movie theaters. Sanford arranged for their release and had them returned to the college campus. Later in June, he summoned 150 black civic leaders to the North Carolina State Capitol where he told them that he would not \"let mass demonstrations destroy us.\" He told them that their enemy was not white people; instead, it was \"a system bequeathed to us by a cotton economy, kindled by stubbornness, intolerance, hotheadedness, North and South exploding into war and leaving to our generation the ashes of vengeance, retribution, and poverty. The way to fight this common enemy is education.\" In early July, Sanford convened a meeting of over 200 municipal officials and established a Mayors Coordinating Committee to address civil rights concerns.\nIn January 1964, James Farmer and Floyd McKissick of the Congress of Racial Equality demanded that the city of Chapel Hill, already one of the most integrated communities in the state, fully desegregate by February 1 or face a wave of demonstrations. Sanford released a statement of reproach towards the ultimatum and promised municipal officials his support. He later said, \"I felt that I had been pushed around long enough.\" The following month activists went through with their protests, heightening local tensions and resulting in numerous arrests. Sanford hosted Farmer and McKissick at the Governor's Mansion in an attempt to broker a solution, but the situation was not resolved until a local committee reached an agreement between the demonstrators and municipal officials.\nHandling the Ku Klux Klan.\nDuring Sanford's tenure, activities of the white supremacist Ku Klux Klan in North Carolina rapidly increased. Sanford requested information on the Klan from the FBI. When the reports were found to be insufficient and unsatisfactory, he arranged for an undercover agent of the FBI working in the North Carolina Division of Motor Vehicles to infiltrate the organization in the eastern portion of the state. Several months later the FBI announced that North Carolina had one of the largest Klan membership in the country.\nIn June 1964, an interracial group of students traveled to Elm City to renovate a local African-American church. Members of the United Klans of America confronted the youths, who promptly left the state. When a larger interracial group arrived to complete the work, 250 klansmen marched into the town and two of them attempted to burn the church down. On June 22, Sanford issued a statement referring to anti-Klan legislation and saying, \"Because there is a growing concern across the state, I think it is necessary to remind the people involved that the Ku Klux Klan is not going to take over North Carolina.\"\nSanford condemned the Klan's methods and ordered the State Highway Patrol to assist the municipal police in protecting the church and maintaining order. His staff quietly brokered a compromise, convincing the local pastor to accommodate the white volunteers in a hotel instead of local black residents' homes, thereby avoiding the racial mixing of which the klansmen disapproved. State authorities dealt with members of the Klan in a similarly accommodating manner throughout the rest of Sanford's tenure, allowing the organization to strengthen its position in the region. In response to Sanford's criticism of their actions in Elm City, klansmen burnt a cross on the lawn of the Governor's Mansion in mid-August. Sanford inspected the cross, later commenting, \"It is a badge of honor to have such hoodlums against you, but it is a mark of shame for the state of North Carolina to have such childish activities going on.\" In December when the Klan threatened businessmen who had sponsored interracial Christmas parades, he encouraged its members to \"read the Christmas story and the message of goodwill towards all men contained in the Bible\" and declared that \"If there are any illegal acts on the part of the Ku Klux Klan they will be prosecuted.\"\nLater tenure.\nIt was rumored by Kennedy's personal secretary, Evelyn Lincoln, that Kennedy had considered removing Johnson as vice president from his electoral ticket in the 1964 presidential election and replacing him with Sanford. Sanford later dismissed these rumors, feeling that such an action was not politically advantageous and would have damaged Kennedy's election prospects in the South. Presidential adviser Larry O'Brien also dismissed the notion that Johnson would be replaced.\nKennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963. Sanford was in Winston-Salem when he heard that the president had been shot. He directed his driver to take him back to the Governor's Mansion in Raleigh, and along the way he learned that Kennedy had died. His office issued a brief statement, calling the event \"overwhelming\". Sanford rarely spoke of Kennedy's assassination in his later years, and preferred to avoid discussion of it when the subject arose. He felt that it had changed the world and negatively impacted the United States. He and his family attended Kennedy's state funeral in Washington D.C. The assassination came at a time when Sanford had been lobbying Kennedy to consider locating a large environmental research center in North Carolina. The decision then fell to Johnson, who succeeded Kennedy as President of the United States and had to consider pressure from other politicians that wanted the facility in their own respective states.\nSanford's racial policies upset North Carolina's white populace, though he was able to contain white backlash throughout his administration. During the 1964 North Carolina gubernatorial election, L. Richardson Preyer, a supporter of Sanford, faced conservative Dan K. Moore in the Democratic primary election. Sanford had originally wanted Lieutenant Governor Philpott to succeed him, but Philpott had unexpectedly died in August 1961. He instead endorsed Preyer while Lake endorsed Moore. At the same time Johnson was running for election as President of the United States, and Sanford actively supported him. The gubernatorial contest devolved into a \"de facto\" referendum on Sanford's tenure, particularly his handling of race matters, and Moore secured the nomination. Lake dubbed the outcome a popular rejection of Sanford's service. Sanford felt betrayed by civil rights leaders, since he thought that their insistence on continuing demonstrations in Chapel Hill had aggravated white resentment and damaged Preyer's electoral prospects.\nAnticipating that Moore and his allies would attempt to dismantle some of his initiatives upon assuming office, Sanford spent the last six months of his term trying to ensure the protection of his projects. He invited Moore's wife, Jeanelle C. Moore, into the board of trustees of the North Carolina School of the Arts and placed one of Moore's top aides on the board of the North Carolina Fund. He also transferred a summer internship program for college students interested in state politics out of the governor's office and into UNC's Institute of Government.\nEven as he was preparing to leave office, Sanford felt that he had much more work to accomplish. He urged the Research Triangle Institute to study affordable housing proposals and established a commission to plan for the future of development and growth in the Piedmont Crescent region. He traveled to Washington D.C. to have his official portrait made and then went to New York to present Jackie Kennedy with North Carolina's financial contribution to the construction of the Kennedy Library. In early December Sanford commuted the sentences of several Chapel Hill protesters. Shortly before leaving office in January 1965, he reached a deal with the Johnson administration for the $25 million environmental research facility to be located at the Research Triangle Park. Reflecting on the impending end of his term, he expressed regret that more black employees had not been hired by the state and that he had not done enough to promote prison reform. In his final publicly broadcast address as governor, he asserted, \"If our weapon against poverty and bigotry is education, we can conquer all battles and make North Carolina a leader of all the rest of the nation.\" He was succeeded as Governor of North Carolina by Moore on January 8, 1965.\nImmediate post-gubernatorial career.\nSanford enjoyed his time as governor, but by the time his term was over he was very unpopular in North Carolina. After leaving office, he returned to Fayetteville and opened a new law firm in Raleigh with some of his former colleagues. In 1966, he published \"But What About the People?\", a book about his tenure as governor. The following year, he released \"Storm Over the States\", a study of the role of state governments in handling American public issues.\nSanford was quietly disappointed with Moore's tenure as governor, as Moore took little interest in furthering his predecessor's initiatives. In 1967 he mulled over the possibility of challenging conservative Democrat Sam Ervin for his U.S. Senate seat. The two men disliked each other; Sanford thought of Ervin as a \"constitutional racist\" who delayed national progress on civil-rights issues, while Ervin remained bitter about Sanford's early support for Kennedy in 1960. Though he had spoken about the inferiority of a Senate seat as compared to the governorship, Sanford was encouraged by his chances at a bid, as discontent over the sales tax on food had faded and his favorability ratings improved. He ultimately decided against it after concluding that the contest would divide the Democratic Party and he would lose on account of his civil rights positions. He then agreed to serve as President Johnson's campaign manager in the 1968 presidential election just before Johnson's withdrawal on March 31. He subsequently declined an offer from Robert F. Kennedy to assist his presidential campaign. Vice President Hubert Humphrey then became the presumptive Democratic nominee for president, and considered including Sanford on his ticket as the vice presidential candidate. Sanford attended the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and delivered the speech seconding Humphrey's nomination for the party's endorsement. He was embittered by the disdain with which the delegates treated the outgoing President Johnson, and disapproved of Humphrey's choice of Senator Edmund Muskie of Maine for as his vice presidential candidate. During the convention Sanford called Johnson to wish him a happy birthday. The President offered to appoint him United States Secretary of Agriculture for the last few months of his term, but Sanford declined. Sanford subsequently served as chairman for the Citizens for Humphrey-Muskie Committee and in that position helped fundraise for Humphrey's campaign and encouraged the candidate to break from Johnson's views on the controversial Vietnam War. Humphrey lost the election to Republican Richard Nixon.\nPresident of Duke University.\nSelection.\nIn 1969, the private Duke University in Durham, North Carolina was wracked by a wave of student unrest over the Vietnam War and civil rights issues. Unable to contain the situation, University President Douglas Knight resigned and the board of trustees began searching for a new president. Trustee Molly Brian recommended that the board consider Sanford, as she had known him when he chaired the board of trustees for Methodist College. The idea gained traction among the board and the university's presidential search committee. Sanford heard rumors of his consideration and, though he thought he would like the job, believed it was unlikely that it would ultimately be offered to him. During this time he focused on work at his law firm while turning down several prospective private sector positions, as he wanted to keep his options open in case he wanted to run for public office again. In late October 1969 the search committee officially contacted Sanford and began discussing how he would approach the job. On December 13 the committee informed Sanford that he had been chosen for the presidency. He assumed the responsibilities of the job on April 2, 1970, and was officially inaugurated in a ceremony on October 17, 1970. As president, he lived in the Douglas M. and Grace Knight House. On his first day as university president, Sanford removed a cap on Jewish enrollment, allowing the number of Jewish students to significantly increase over the following years.\nFinances.\nWhen Sanford assumed the university's presidency he sought to improve the school's status. At the time it was experiencing a budget deficit and suffered from a small endowment. Seeking to increase donations, he sought to increase the school's enrollment from North Carolinian public school students and private school students from elsewhere. He hired Croom Beatty, a boarding school fundraiser, as associate director for admissions and tasked him with finding children at private schools who came from wealthy backgrounds. Croom would canvas the private schools for such students and, if he determined that their enrollment at Duke would financially benefit the university, he would recommend Sanford personally review their application\u2014even if they had earned lower grades or test scores. Sanford also personally recommended the consideration of applications from children of prospective donors who he had learned of from various contacts. He also directed baseball coach Tom Butters to spend the summer of 1970 fundraising and sought out North Carolinian alumni to ask for their financial support.\nRelationship with the student body.\nSanford helped quell student unrest over the Vietnam War early in his tenure as university president. Addressing the protests of the 1970 Kent State shootings with tolerance, choosing to not call in police to clear the roads, leading to the protesting students going back to their rooms at night so that West Campus could be reopened the next day kept the campus calm during a turbulent spring. Shortly before his tenure, on February 13, 1969, 60 student members of the Afro-American Society had occupied Duke's main administration center, the Allen Building, demanding the creation of a Black Studies program. After three days of clashes with police, they left the building peaceably February 16, when school officials agreed to the program. During his tenure, Sanford strongly opposed confrontation and a heavy police action which helped defuse racial tensions. He criticized Vice President Spiro Agnew's criticism of student protestors in a \"The New York Times\" op-ed, writing, \"The deep troubles of our society do not begin on college campuses, are not bred there, and are not centered there. Instead, our possibilities for resolving these troubles find their greatest hope on college campuses.\"\nSanford sought to increase student involvement in the running of the university, and hired upperclassmen to work in his office as assistants and researchers. He also designated students to serve as greeters and guides for visiting dignitaries and held social meetings with incoming freshman at his house, eventually known as \"Tea with Terry\". From before his tenure students had complained about a lack of representation on the university board of trustees, and after some students refused to leave an early trustee meeting he negotiated a deal with them, whereby they would leave but a reporter from the student newspaper, The Chronicle, would stay to report on the proceedings and a committee would be formed to consider making the meetings public. The committee later agreed to the idea, and in late 1970 Sanford recommended a student representative be designated to sit with the board. The \"radical\" students on campus were surprised by his accommodating style. Duke graduate and local journalist Mark Pinksy told \"The New York Times\", \"He's just plain smarter than the radicals are. He's co-opted the hell out of them.\"\nRegional issues and economic and government reform.\nIn the fall of 1970, Sanford permitted Duke students leave to participate in congressional campaigns. That election season, numerous \"New South\" governors were elected across the Southern United States, including Dale Bumpers in Araknsas, Reubin Askew in Florida, John C. West in South Carolina, and Jimmy Carter in Georgia. Sanford held a grudge against Carter for using race-baiting tactics to defeat his friend Carl Sanders in the Democratic primary. These new governors mostly avoided racial rhetoric in office and advocated for governmental reform, triggering renewed national interest in the region. In a speech in May 1971, \"The South's time has come after a century of being the whipping boy and the backward child [...] The South can lead the nation, must lead the nation\u2014and all the better, because the nation has never been in greater need of leadership.\" Sanford suggested that the Southern states act in concert in their efforts to resolve regional issues; he proposed that a regional body be established to assist in coordinating growth and economic development in the South. Working with academics, he assisted in the foundation of the Southern Growth Policies Board on December 16, 1971. \nIn 1971 Sanford also recruited Joel Fleischman, one of his former aides in the governor's office, to come to Duke and establish a school for public policy. Fleishman created the Institute of Policy Studies and Public Affairs in January 1972.\nIn July 1979 Sanford began a year-long sabbatical and used the time to write \"A Danger of Democracy\", a book which proposed reforming political parties' presidential nomination processes.\nNixon presidential library.\nIn 1981 Sanford entertained the idea of location Nixon's presidential library and museum at Duke, where it could become a center of research and bolster the university's reputation. Sanford raised the subject with Nixon during a visit to the former president at Nixon's New York City office on July 28, 1981, and the former president was receptive to the idea. While Sanford tried to win over the faculty to his idea\u2014many of whom disliked Nixon and were worried about his scandal-ridden reputation damaging the university\u2014the media began reporting that Duke was a prospective site for the library. Opposition from professors mounted as they expressed concerns that the museum would become little more than a monument to Nixon while the most sensitive and valuable documents of his public career would not be kept in the library. Some called for Sanford's resignation.\nSeveral dozen faculty supported Sanford's initiative, but in response to the controversy he modified his proposal to have the library located at the Research Triangle Park with the support of other regional university leaders. The plan quickly fell apart after the faculty of other universities began declaring their opposition to it, and Sanford began to feel embarrassed by the affair. The Duke Academic Council, a governing body representing the university's faculty, voted to eliminate the museum from the offer and scale down the planned size of the library. Discouraged, Nixon declined Sanford's offer and established his library in Yorba Linda, California.\nSanford officially resigned on July 4, 1985. He was succeeded by H. Keith H. Brodie, his preferred successor.\nConcurrent political activities.\nUpon being invested as president of Duke, Sanford told a \"New York Times\" reporter that he had decided against any state-related political responsibilities through 1972, but had not pledged similarly about a national office, saying, \"I won't campaign for it, but I've never made a Sherman-like statement that I wouldn't accept it.\" Privately, he maintained contact with some of his former political acquaintances such as Bennett, but felt that if he became too politically involved the board of trustees would fire him. Sanford believed that Nixon would be re-elected to the United States presidency and ruled out the possibility of seeking the Democratic nomination in the 1972 presidential primary. That January, several Duke students approached him to request his assent to a petition to put his name on the Democratic ballot. They felt that the slate of candidates in the primary was weak. Sanford himself thought Senator Edmund Muskie\u2014who was gaining endorsements from party stalwarts\u2014was an unremarkable candidate and was worried that liberals were uniting behind Senator George McGovern, and had encouraged Humphrey to re-seek nomination.\nSanford figured that the board of trustees would solve his dilemma by forcing him to stop the petition drive. The board argued over the affair but ultimately decided to let Sanford launch a candidacy. His friends thought a presidential campaign was ill-advised, and North Carolina Governor Bob Scott\u2014who had already pledged his support to Muskie\u2014was angered when he learned of Sanford possibly entering the race. Sanford claimed to have firmly decided to contest the nomination after seeing Muskie's public reaction to the Canuck letter. According to biographers Howard E. Covington Jr. and Marion Ellis, \"If there was anything that moved Sanford to make the leap in 1972, it was probably his desire to challenge Wallace and show the nation that all Southern politicians were not demagogues.\" George Wallace was the Governor of Alabama and an avowed racial segregationist. Sanford felt that Wallace did not truly believe in segregation and employed race-baiting tactics as an opportunity to gain votes. He later said of Wallace, \"I always thought George was just a pure hypocrite [...] George saw it as just a great game, just another issue to be played, and he played it the way it was an advantage to play it. He publicly declared his candidacy for the Democratic nomination on March 8. He stated his intention to stay on Duke's campus and campaign on the weekends aim to get the support of 100 delegates before the Democratic convention.\nSome media response was positive, but the press was generally skeptical of Sanford's candidacy. Among the others competing in the North Carolina primary were Wallace, Senator Henry M. Jackson, and Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. Sanford struggled to gain media attention, and ran on a platform of eliminating tax loopholes for rich people, establishing price controls on food, increasing Social Security payments by 25 percent, supporting equal rights for women, creating a national health insurance plan, and devolution of power from the federal government to the states. While focusing most of his efforts on North Carolina, he also built a small national campaign organization. He also visited former president Johnson at his ranch in Texas and received a $500 campaign donation. One poll showed Wallace in first place in North Carolina with 33 percent of the vote and Sanford with 28 percent; the latter was encouraged, but anxious that Chisholm would draw away black voters he needed to overcome Wallace. On the night before the election, he conducted a television appearance where voters asked him questions about his platform. Responding to a question about the seriousness of his candidacy for the presidency or if he was seeking a position to bargain for another office, he said, \"I'd rather be president of Duke University than vice president and furthermore I'd rather be unemployed than be in the cabinet.\"\nWallace won the North Carolina with over 40 percent of the total, securing 408,000 votes. Sanford received 304,000, while Chisholm got 61,000. Sanford's friend Sam Poole said that the loss \"was really a very low point in his life.\" Despite the setback, he decided to continue his campaign to the convention in Miami. He managed only a fifth-place finish with 77.5 delegate votes, behind McGovern (1,864.95), Jackson (525), Wallace (381.7), and Chisholm (151.95).\nUndeterred, Sanford began preparations two years later for a run for the 1976 Democratic presidential nomination. Announcing his candidacy on June 1, 1975, he juggled campaign appearances with his obligations as president of Duke. While he developed a following among educators, he did not have a satisfactory campaign theme by the new year. Then, while campaigning in Massachusetts in January, he suffered sharp pains and was diagnosed with a heart murmur. On January 25, Sanford withdrew from the primaries, the first Democrat to do so that year. Sanford was left near bankruptcy by his abortive candidacy, though his friend Paul Vick later assisted him in managing his finances and recouping some of his wealth. He thereafter refocused his time on running the university, and in 1977 he rejected President Jimmy Carter's offer to appoint him United States Ambassador to France.\nIn 1984 former Democratic governor Jim Hunt challenged Republican incumbent Jesse Helms for a seat in the U.S. Senate. Sanford considered challenging Helms himself, but resolved that Hunt should make the bid as \"it was his time\". Sanford initially advised Hunt's campaign, warning him not to engage in the negative campaigning that Helms employed. Hunt eventually embraced this strategy and Sanford was left out of meetings. Hunt lost the campaign.\nAfter retiring as president of Duke University in 1985, Sanford remained active in party politics. He made an unsuccessful run for chairman of the Democratic National Committee in 1985, losing to Paul G. Kirk by a vote of 203\u2013150.\nSenate career.\n1986 campaign and election.\nIn late 1985 Sanford began consulting his friends on the possibility of running for a seat in the U.S. Senate the following year. Sanford declared his candidacy in January 1986. The announcement surprised and embittered his longtime friend and political ally Lauch Faircloth, who had wanted to run for the seat with Sanford's support and was angered by rumors that Sanford had denigrated his own chances in an election. After the misunderstanding, Faircloth and Sanford did not speak with one another until shortly before the latter's death. Sanford won the Democratic primary with 409,394 votes, easily defeating the nine other candidates and marking the first time he had won a statewide election since 1960. His opponent in the general election was Republican U.S. House Representative Jim Broyhill as the incumbent senator, Republican John P. East, had declared his intention to retire. After East committed suicide on June 29, 1986, Broyhill was temporarily appointed to the seat on July 3, pending the election to fill it on November\u00a04. During the campaign Sanford stressed his accomplishments as governor and his military service. Critics of Sanford primarily focused on three areas: his promotion of opportunities for minorities, \"tax-and-spend\" education funding, and his anti-poverty efforts. Sanford initially maintained a positive campaign, but attacked Broyhill as \"no friend of education\" and criticised his failure to minimize President Ronald Reagan's free trade policies which hurt the textiles industry after Broyhill released a television ad that condemned his imposition of the sales tax on food while serving as governor. Sanford defeated Broyhill by three percentage points in the November election earning about 60,000 more votes, securing victory in the contest to serve the last months of East's term and the subsequent six-year term. He was sworn in to office on December 10 by his friend and former law partner Judge James Dickson Phillips Jr. on the steps of the United States Capitol. He was sworn in again to the full six-year term on January 6, 1987.\nTenure.\nSanford felt uncomfortable in the Senate after being used to holding executive offices and thought the body its wasted time, writing, \"We get so little done for all the energy we expend.\" He served on multiple Senate committees: Select Committee on Ethics (Chair); Special Committee on Aging; Budget; Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs including the Subcommittee on International Finance and Monetary Policy and Subcommittee on Securities; and Foreign Relations including Subcommittee on Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs (Chair), Subcommittee on African Affairs, and Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere and Peace Corps Affairs. As was custom among members of the majority party, Sanford presided over sessions of the Senate on several occasions. He stayed in an apartment near the Capitol, and usually reported to his office by 8:00 AM and worked until returning home later in the evening. He usually returned to his house in Durham on the weekends.\nDuring his Senate campaign, Sanford criticized President Reagan's policy towards the Contra War in Nicaragua, as the latter funneled American financial support to the right-aligned Contras while they waged an insurgency against the leftist Sandanista government. Sanford hoped to propose an alternative solution to the conflict based upon the Marshall Plan. In February 1986 Sanford and Senator Chris Dodd traveled to Central America to study the issue. At the same time President Oscar Arias of Costa Rica was hosting a multilateral conference with representatives of nearby countries troubled by the conflict in Nicaragua. Sanford proposed to Arias that after the war ended a multinational working group be created to plan for economic redevelopment of the region. Arias was receptive to the idea, and soon after Sanford returned to the United States he delivered his first major speech before the Senate, supporting a resolution commending Arias' initiatives to host negotiations and end the Nicaraguan civil war. The resolution passed, 97 votes to one. In June Sanford announced the creation of an International Commission for Central American Recovery and Development to create an outline for regional development under the coordination of Duke University's Center for International Development Research. As with the North Carolina Fund, Sanford secured backing from private philanthropic organizations to fund the body's work. By the time the group had its first meeting in December, he had recruited 47 members including diplomats, scholars, and economists. Though Sanford was not a member of the body, it became known as the \"Sanford Commission\" for his role in its creation. He repeatedly returned to Central America to tour Nicaragua and observe Arias' peace process.\nThe commission published its report in 1989, recommending action taken to ensure human rights and the fulfillment economic necessities of the region's population. The document was endorsed by five Central American presidents. Sanford believed the commission's work hastened the end of the Contra War and reoriented local focus on economic recovery, reflecting, \"I consider it the most significant thing I did in Washington.\" Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega personally thanked Sanford for his efforts, and he was commended by his Senate colleagues Bob Dole and John Kerry. Sanford proposed a bill to appropriate federal funds to the commission's use, but it was not acted upon for years and was challenged by Helms, who sought to attach statements to it calling on Central America to embrace free enterprise initiatives. Sanford found Helms' actions irksome, and though his bill finally passed the Senate in September 1991, the money it appropriated was never handed over.\nSanford kept a journal during his Senate tenure, and often wrote about his irritation with the body's deference to member seniority instead of better ideas, the existence of incomprehensible legislative rules, and jurisdictional feuds between committee chairs. He also perceived an increase in partisanship and a diminishing willingness for compromise. He strongly disapproved of Helms, writing, \"I think his service in the Senate has been largely of zero value to North Carolina...He has a negative attitude about everything, and it is very difficult to find anything up here that he has done that has any lasting value.\" The two usually maintained cordial relations, though in one instance Helms angrily denounced Sanford to the press after the latter made a joke at Helms' expense during a committee hearing. Helms' later apologized.\nFrom early on in his tenure Sanford was troubled by the Reagan administration's growing deficit spending and Congress' toleration of it. He crafted an \"Honest Budget Bill\" that mandated a balanced budget, introduced taxes to increase revenue, and separated the Social Security Trust Fund from other government trusts. A few of his proposals were ultimately incorporated into other measures. During the contentious Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination, Sanford was chosen by Senate Democrats to deliver a televised address explaining their opposition to Bork's nomination. Sanford stated that Bork was more interested in affirming his own personal opinions that conducting proper jurisprudence, and when the nomination came to a full vote before the Senate Sanford voted against it.\nAs a Senator, Sanford was involved in efforts to recruit Democratic candidates for the 1988 United States presidential election. After unsuccessfully attempting to recruit Arkansas Senator Dale Bumpers and New York Governor Mario Cuomo, he endorsed Tennessee Senator Al Gore's campaign, privately dismissing Jesse Jackson for running a \"purely racist campaign\". Gore later dropped out and Sanford dutifully backed Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis, though he found Dukakis' campaign staff arrogant and uncooperative. Dukakis lost the election to Republican George H. W. Bush, and Democrats performed poorly in North Carolina elections, leaving Sanford as the leading elected North Carolina Democrat. In the contests' aftermath he increasingly bemoaned the leftward lean of the national Democratic Party, objecting to Ron Brown's assumption of the chair of the Democratic National Committee and expressing concern that the Democrats were \"perceived by far too many people as being the black man's party\", thus losing support from moderate whites. Sanford wrote in his journal that \"the lingering race prejudice does, indeed, drive a great many white people away from the Democratic Party\".\nSanford was initially hopeful that he could influence policy with the incoming Bush administration, but quickly tired of Bush, becoming outraged with his nomination of John Tower as Secretary of Defense and upset with\u2014in his view\u2014Bush's focus on trivial affairs meant to garner him short-term electoral support rather than provide long-term benefit to the country. Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the conviction of a man who had burned a United States Flag as an act of protest, Bush and congressional Republicans proposed a Flag Desecration Amendment to the United States Constitution that would make it illegal for a person to burn American flags. Sanford thought Bush was pursuing a \"demagogic, vote-getting, low-principled course\" and\u2014though he personally disagreed with flag burning\u2014he thought that such an amendment ran contrary to the ideals of political freedom included in the Bill of Rights. On October 17, 1989, Sanford delivered a speech in the Senate on the issue, saying that a prohibition of flag burning diminished the right to protest and weakened the Bill of Rights. He thought the speech was the best of his time in the Senate, and once he finished John Danforth, a cosponsor of the amendment, rose to say he had not thoughtfully considered the implications of the measure and would vote against it. The amendment ultimately failed to garner the necessary support of two-thirds of the body to pass.\nBy 1990 Sanford began having doubts about his future and about running for reelection. Reflecting on his past four years in the Senate, he wrote, \"Its usefulness, its contribution to the nation and the state...was marginal.\" Sanford had a liberal voting record in comparison to his Democratic colleagues from the South, and it was consistently more liberal than that of any of his North Carolinian predecessors, being given an American Conservative Union rating of 12%.\nFollowing Iraq's August Invasion of Kuwait, Bush moved military forces to the Persian Gulf region. Sanford preferred to impose sanctions against Iraq rather than pursue a military solution, saying to the Senate, \"There is no reason for us to get involved in a shooting, killing war to take Kuwait.\" He became a leading critic of American involvement in the ensuing Gulf War while at the same time growing more resolved to retire from the Senate. Several weeks later he became surprised to hear that Faircloth had switched his party registration to Republican and was preparing to challenge Sanford in the 1992 election for his Senate seat. His efforts to recruit his own successor candidate failed. In September Sanford abruptly changed his mind and decided to run for reelection, saying, \"I could find no decent way to be a lame duck.\"\n1992 campaign.\nSanford officially announced his campaign for reelection on December 2, 1991. He faced no Democratic opposition for regaining his seat, while Faircloth, enjoying substantial backing from Helms' National Congressional Club, won the Republican primary. Both men pledged to run issues-oriented campaigns and avoid personal attacks. In June 1992 he became afflicted with illness and was admitted to Duke Medical Center for treatment of a heart valve infection. This delayed his attempts to campaign, but he returned to work in the Senate in late July. Sanford was heavily involved in the direction of his campaign and pledged to tour all 100 North Carolina counties. Early polling suggested he enjoyed a large lead over Faircloth. Faircloth attacked Sanford as beholden to special interests and an advocate of big government and higher taxes. Sanford countered by portraying his opponent as a conservative hard-liner. During a televised debate in September Sanford countered Faircloth's accusations that he was a spendthrift by pointing to his efforts at budget reform.\nBy October Sanford's heart infection had grown more serious and he underwent surgery to replace the troubled valve, temporarily preventing him from campaigning. He was released from the hospital two weeks later, but he was noticeably thinner and the surgery had risen public doubts about his health. Without his leadership during the interim, his campaign lost initiative to Faircloth, who questioned his views on the Gulf War and characterized him as a Washington D.C. insider. On November 3, 1992, Faircloth won the election by a 100,000-vote margin, though Democrat Bill Clinton won national election as United States President, while Jim Hunt was reelected Governor of North Carolina. Sanford celebrated the overall outcome at the North Raleigh Hilton Hotel, declaring, \"This is a great night for the Democratic Party. We have the nation on the right track again. We have the state on the right track.\"\nLater life and death.\nSanford wrote several books, including: \"But What About the People?\", where he describes his efforts during the 1960s to establish a system of quality public education in North Carolina; \"Storm Over the States\", where he lays forth a new groundwork for state government and the federal system by recommending a \"creative federalism\"; and \"Outlive Your Enemies: Grow Old Gracefully\", where he describes actions that will slow the aging process and rules for prolonging healthy life. He also taught classes in law and political science at Duke University and campaigned for the construction of a major performing arts center in the Research Triangle area that would provide a permanent home for the American Dance Festival, the North Carolina Symphony and the Carolina Ballet. Sanford practiced law again in his later years and merged his own firm with that of another former governor, James Holshouser. Holshouser continued to practice with Sanford Holshouser LLP until his death (the firm continues under that name), and their economic development consulting firm continued under that name.\nIn December 1997 Sanford went to Duke Medical Center after experiencing a low-grade fever for several days, fearing he had a heart infection. Doctors discovered cancer in his esophagus and liver and ruled that it was inoperable. They informed him that he could live for six months, and later that month he went back to the hospital for treatment. He died on April 18, 1998, at his home. His funeral was held four days later at Duke Chapel, attended by 17 U.S. Senators, four former governors, 100 members of the General Assembly, and the North Carolina Council of State. Soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division acted as an honor guard. Thomas Langford, the former dean of the Duke Divinity School, delivered the eulogy. Sanford was entombed in the chapel's crypt.\nLegacy.\nSanford was one of the key figures of the New South, a historical era of social modernization in the region. Journalist John Drescher dubbed him \"the first New South governor\" while George Wallace called him \"the symbol of the New South.\" Journalist Rob Christensen credited him with helping to \"set a tone of moderation in North Carolina in the sixties\". He is remembered in North Carolina as the \"education governor\"; historians and journalists have often cited Sanford's actions as governor as the source of North Carolina's historical policy focus on reforming education. In recognition of his efforts in education and in other areas, a 1981 Harvard University survey named him one of the 10 best governors of the 20th century. A study conducted by political scientist Larry Sabato concluded that Sanford was one of the best 12 governors to serve in the United States between 1950 and 1975. Historian William D. Goldsmith wrote, \"Terry Sanford tested the limits of what a governor\u2014or a politician period\u2014could do in North Carolina of the early 1960s to advance human development without federal intervention.\"\nPolitical scientist Tom Eamon dubbed Sanford \"North Carolina's most celebrated liberal politician\". Sanford served as a role model to a number of Southern governors, including Jim Hunt of North Carolina (his protege), William Winter of Mississippi, and Bill Clinton of Arkansas. When Parris Glendening was campaigning to become Governor of Maryland in 1994, he promised voters that would model his administration after Sanford's. Upon Sanford's death Clinton\u2014who had since become President of the United States\u2014said, \"His work and his influence literally changed the face and future of the South, making him one of the most influential Americans of the last 50\u00a0years.\" Senator John Edwards said that Sanford was his \"political hero\". Journalist David Stout characterized Sanford as a \"contradictory politician\" and a man who \"lack[ed] burning desire.\"\nDuke University has since renamed the institute in public policy the Sanford School of Public Policy. Fayetteville Senior High School was renamed Terry Sanford High School in his honor in 1968. The Terry Sanford Federal Building and Courthouse in Raleigh was named in honor of Sanford in 1999. In 2011 his friends and family placed a placard along Church Street in Laurinburg to mark near where he was born."}
{"title": "Bill_Clinton", "label": "Politician", "text": "William Jefferson Clinton (; born August 19, 1946) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 42nd president of the United States from 1993 to 2001. He previously served as governor of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and again from 1983 to 1992, and as attorney general of Arkansas from 1977 to 1979. A member of the Democratic Party, Clinton became known as a New Democrat, as many of his policies reflected a centrist \"Third Way\" political philosophy. He is the husband of Hillary Clinton, who was a senator from New York from 2001 to 2009, secretary of state from 2009 to 2013 and the Democratic nominee for president in the 2016 presidential election.\nClinton was born and raised in Arkansas and attended Georgetown University. He received a Rhodes Scholarship to study at University College, Oxford, and he later graduated from Yale Law School. He met Hillary Rodham at Yale; they married in 1975. After graduating from law school, Clinton returned to Arkansas and won election as state attorney general, followed by two non-consecutive terms as Arkansas governor. As governor, he overhauled the state's education system and served as chairman of the National Governors Association. Clinton was elected president in the 1992 presidential election, defeating incumbent Republican president George H. W. Bush and independent businessman Ross Perot. At 46 years old, he became the third-youngest president of the United States.\nClinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, but failed to pass his plan for national health care reform. In the 1994 elections, the Republican Party won unified control of Congress for the first time in 40 years. In 1996, however, he was reelected in a landslide. During this time Clinton began an ideological evolution as he became much more conservative in his domestic policy advocating for welfare reform and the State Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as financial deregulation measures. He also appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer to the U.S. Supreme Court. During the last three years of Clinton's presidency, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus\u2014the first such surplus since 1969. In foreign policy, Clinton ordered U.S. military intervention in the Bosnian and Kosovo wars, signed the Dayton Peace agreement, signed the Iraq Liberation Act in opposition to Saddam Hussein, participated in the Oslo I Accord and Camp David Summit to advance the Israeli\u2013Palestinian peace process, and assisted the Northern Ireland peace process.\nClinton's second term would be dominated by the Monica Lewinsky scandal which began in 1996, when he began a sexual affair with 22-year-old White House intern Monica Lewinsky. In January 1998, news of the sexual relationship made tabloid headlines. The scandal escalated throughout the year, culminating on December 19 when Clinton was impeached by the House of Representatives, becoming the second U.S. president to be impeached after Andrew Johnson. The two impeachment articles that the House passed were based on him using the powers of the presidency to obstruct the investigation and that he lied under oath. The following year saw the impeachment trial begin in the Senate, but Clinton was acquitted on both charges as the Senate failed to cast 67 votes against him, the conviction threshold.\nClinton left office with the highest end-of-term approval rating of any U.S. president since Franklin D. Roosevelt. His presidency has been ranked among the upper tier in historical rankings of U.S. presidents. However, his personal conduct and allegations of sexual assault against him have made him the subject of substantial scrutiny. Since leaving office, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. Clinton created the Clinton Foundation to address international causes such as the prevention of HIV/AIDS and global warming. In 2009, he was named the United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti. After the 2010 Haiti earthquake, Clinton and George W. Bush formed the Clinton Bush Haiti Fund. He has remained active in Democratic Party politics, campaigning for his wife's 2008 and 2016 presidential campaigns.\nEarly life and career.\nClinton was born William Jefferson Blythe III on August 19, 1946, at Julia Chester Hospital in Hope, Arkansas. He is the son of William Jefferson Blythe Jr., a traveling salesman who had died in an automobile accident three months before his birth, and Virginia Dell Cassidy (later Virginia Kelley). His parents had married on September 4, 1943, but this union later proved to be bigamous, as Blythe was still married to his third wife. Virginia traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after Bill was born, leaving him in Hope with her parents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small grocery store. At a time when the southern United States was racially segregated, Clinton's grandparents sold goods on credit to people of all races. In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married Roger Clinton Sr., who co-owned an automobile dealership in Hot Springs, Arkansas, with his brother and Earl T. Ricks. The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.\nAlthough he immediately assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Clinton turned 15 that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward him. Clinton has described his stepfather as a gambler and an alcoholic who regularly abused his mother and half-brother, Roger Clinton Jr. He threatened his stepfather with violence multiple times to protect them.\nIn Hot Springs, Clinton attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and Hot Springs High School, where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician. Clinton was in the chorus and played the tenor saxophone, winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography \"My Life\":\nClinton began an interest in law at Hot Springs High, when he took up the challenge to argue the defense of the ancient Roman senator Catiline in a mock trial in his Latin class. After a vigorous defense that made use of his \"budding rhetorical and political skills\", he told the Latin teacher Elizabeth Buck it \"made him realize that someday he would study law\".\nClinton has identified two influential moments in his life, both occurring in 1963, that contributed to his decision to become a public figure. One was his visit as a Boys Nation senator to the White House to meet President John F. Kennedy. The other was watching Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 \"I Have a Dream\" speech on TV, which impressed him so much that he later memorized it.\nCollege and law school years.\nGeorgetown University.\nWith the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, D.C., receiving a Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service degree in 1968. Georgetown was the only school where Clinton applied.\nIn 1964 and 1965, Clinton won elections for class president. From 1964 to 1967, he was an intern and then a clerk in the office of Arkansas Senator J. William Fulbright. While in college, he became a brother of service fraternity Alpha Phi Omega and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Clinton was also a member of the Order of DeMolay, a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a Freemason. He is a member of Kappa Kappa Psi honorary band fraternity.\nOxford.\nUpon graduating from Georgetown in 1968, Clinton won a Rhodes Scholarship to University College, Oxford, where he initially read for a B.Phil. in philosophy, politics, and economics but transferred to a B.Litt. in politics and, ultimately, a B.Phil. in politics. Clinton did not expect to return for the second year because of the draft and so he switched programs; this type of activity was common among other Rhodes Scholars from his cohort. He had received an offer to study at Yale Law School, Yale University, and so he left early to return to the United States and did not receive a degree from Oxford.\nDuring his time at Oxford, Clinton befriended fellow American Rhodes Scholar Frank Aller. In 1969, Aller received a draft letter that mandated deployment to the Vietnam War. Aller's 1971 suicide had an influential impact on Clinton. British writer and feminist Sara Maitland said of Clinton, \"I remember Bill and Frank Aller taking me to a pub in Walton Street in the summer term of 1969 and talking to me about the Vietnam War. I knew nothing about it, and when Frank began to describe the napalming of civilians I began to cry. Bill said that feeling bad wasn't good enough. That was the first time I encountered the idea that liberal sensitivities weren't enough and you had to do something about such things\". Clinton was a member of the Oxford University Basketball Club and also played for Oxford University's rugby union team.\nWhile Clinton was president in 1994, he received an honorary degree and a fellowship from the University of Oxford, specifically for being \"a doughty and tireless champion of the cause of world peace\", having \"a powerful collaborator in his wife,\" and for winning \"general applause for his achievement of resolving the gridlock that prevented an agreed budget\".\nVietnam War opposition and draft controversy.\nDuring the Vietnam War, Clinton received educational draft deferments while he was in England in 1968 and 1969. While at Oxford, he participated in Vietnam War protests and organized a Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam event in October 1969. He was planning to attend law school in the U.S. and knew he might lose his deferment. Clinton tried unsuccessfully to obtain positions in the National Guard and the Air Force officer candidate school, and he then made arrangements to join the Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) program at the University of Arkansas.\nHe subsequently decided not to join the ROTC, saying in a letter to the officer in charge of the program that he opposed the war, but did not think it was honorable to use ROTC, National Guard, or Reserve service to avoid serving in Vietnam. He further stated that because he opposed the war, he would not volunteer to serve in uniform, but would subject himself to the draft, and would serve if selected only as a way \"to maintain my political viability within the system\". Clinton registered for the draft and received a high number (311), meaning that those whose birthdays had been drawn as numbers1 to 310 would be drafted before him, making it unlikely he would be called up. (In fact, the highest number drafted was 195.)\nColonel Eugene Holmes, the Army officer who had been involved with Clinton's ROTC application, suspected that Clinton attempted to manipulate the situation to avoid the draft and avoid serving in uniform. He issued a notarized statement during the 1992 presidential campaign:\nDuring the 1992 campaign, it was revealed that Clinton's uncle had attempted to secure him a position in the Navy Reserve, which would have prevented him from being deployed to Vietnam. This effort was unsuccessful and Clinton said in 1992 that he had been unaware of it until then. Although legal, Clinton's actions with respect to the draft and deciding whether to serve in the military were criticized during his first presidential campaign by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans, some of whom charged that he had used Fulbright's influence to avoid military service. Clinton's 1992 campaign manager, James Carville, successfully argued that Clinton's letter in which he declined to join the ROTC should be made public, insisting that voters, many of whom had also opposed the Vietnam War, would understand and appreciate his position.\nLaw school.\nAfter Oxford, Clinton attended Yale Law School and earned a Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree in 1973. In 1971, he met his future wife, Hillary Rodham, in the Yale Law Library; she was a class year ahead of him. They began dating and were soon inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his summer plans to be a coordinator for the George McGovern campaign for the 1972 United States presidential election in order to move in with her in California. The couple continued living together in New Haven when they returned to law school.\nClinton eventually moved to Texas with Rodham in 1972 to take a job leading McGovern's effort there. He spent considerable time in Dallas, at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. Clinton worked with future two-term mayor of Dallas Ron Kirk, future governor of Texas Ann Richards, and then unknown television director and filmmaker Steven Spielberg.\nGovernor of Arkansas (1979\u20131981, 1983\u20131992).\nAfter graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the University of Arkansas. In 1974, he ran for the House of Representatives. Running in the conservative 3rd district against incumbent Republican John Paul Hammerschmidt, Clinton's campaign was bolstered by the anti-Republican and anti-incumbent mood resulting from the Watergate scandal. Hammerschmidt, who had received 77 percent of the vote in 1972, defeated Clinton by only a 52\u00a0percent to 48\u00a0percent margin. In 1976, Clinton ran for Arkansas attorney general. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election, Clinton was elected.\nIn 1978, Clinton entered the Arkansas gubernatorial primary. At just 31 years old, he was one of the youngest gubernatorial candidates in the state's history. Clinton was elected Governor of Arkansas in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate Lynn Lowe, a farmer from Texarkana. Clinton was only 32 years old when he took office, the youngest governor in the country at the time and the second youngest governor in the history of Arkansas. Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the \"Boy Governor\". He worked on educational reform and directed the maintenance of Arkansas's roads, with wife Hillary leading a successful committee on urban health care reform. However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of Cuban refugees (from the Mariel boatlift) detained in Fort Chaffee in 1980. Monroe Schwarzlose, of Kingsland in Cleveland County, polled 31\u00a0percent of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat by Republican challenger Frank D. White in the general election that year. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.\nClinton joined friend Bruce Lindsey's Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings. In 1982, he was elected governor a second time and kept the office for ten years. Effective with the 1986 election, Arkansas had changed its gubernatorial term of office from two to four years. During his term, he helped transform Arkansas's economy and improved the state's educational system. For senior citizens, he removed the sales tax from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption. He became a leading figure among the New Democrats, a group of Democrats who advocated welfare reform, smaller government, and other policies not supported by liberals. Formally organized as the Democratic Leadership Council (DLC), the New Democrats argued that in light of President Ronald Reagan's landslide victory in 1984, the Democratic Party needed to adopt a more centrist political stance in order to succeed at the national level. Clinton delivered the Democratic response to Reagan's 1985 State of the Union Address and served as chair of the National Governors Association from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.\nIn the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority of his gubernatorial administration. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee was chaired by Clinton's wife Hillary, who was also an attorney as well as the chair of the Legal Services Corporation. The committee transformed Arkansas's education system. Proposed reforms included more spending for schools (supported by a sales-tax increase), better opportunities for gifted children, vocational education, higher teachers' salaries, more course variety, and compulsory teacher competency exams. The reforms passed in September 1983 after Clinton called a special legislative session\u2014the longest in Arkansas history. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), Jonesboro businessmen Woody Freeman (1984), and Sheffield Nelson of Little Rock (1990).\nAlso in the 1980s, the Clintons' personal and business affairs included transactions that became the basis of the Whitewater controversy investigation, which later dogged his presidential administration. After extensive investigation over several years, no indictments were made against the Clintons related to the years in Arkansas.\nAccording to some sources, Clinton was a death penalty opponent in his early years, but he eventually switched positions. However he might have felt previously, by 1992, Clinton was insisting that Democrats \"should no longer feel guilty about protecting the innocent\". During Clinton's final term as governor, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been reinstated in 1976). As Governor, he oversaw the first four executions carried out by the state of Arkansas since the death penalty was reinstated there in 1976: one by electric chair and three by lethal injection. To draw attention to his stance on capital punishment, Clinton flew home to Arkansas mid-campaign in 1992, in order to affirm in person that the controversial execution of Ricky Ray Rector, would go forward as scheduled.\n1988 Democratic presidential primaries.\nIn 1987, the media speculated that Clinton would enter the presidential race after incumbent New York governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of multiple marital infidelities. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary for governor, initially favored\u2014but ultimately vetoed\u2014by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and twice the length it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered. Clinton presented himself both as a moderate and as a member of the New Democrat wing of the Democratic Party, and he headed the moderate Democratic Leadership Council in 1990 and 1991.\nPresidential campaigns.\n1992.\nIn the first primary contest, the Iowa Caucus, Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa senator Tom Harkin. During the campaign for the New Hampshire primary, reports surfaced that Clinton had engaged in an extramarital affair with Gennifer Flowers. Clinton fell far behind former Massachusetts senator Paul Tsongas in the New Hampshire polls. Following Super Bowl XXVI, Clinton and his wife Hillary went on \"60 Minutes\" to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the New Hampshire primary, but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him \"The Comeback Kid\" for earning a firm second-place finish.\nWinning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the Southern primaries on Super Tuesday gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California governor Jerry Brown was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South. With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate. Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in Jerry Brown's home state of California.\nDuring the campaign, questions of conflict of interest regarding state business and the politically powerful Rose Law Firm, at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay. Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents \"for the price of one\".\nClinton was still the governor of Arkansas while campaigning for U.S. president, and he returned to his home state to see that Ricky Ray Rector would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to both Arkansas state law and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in an article for \"The New York Times\" as a possible political move to counter \"soft on crime\" accusations.\nBush's approval ratings were around 80\u00a0percent during the Gulf War, and he was described as unbeatable. When Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his , which hurt his approval rating. Clinton repeatedly condemned Bush for making a promise he failed to keep. By election time, the economy was souring and Bush saw his approval rating plummet to just slightly over 40\u00a0percent. Finally, conservatives were previously united by anti-communism, but with the end of the Cold War, the party lacked a uniting issue. When Pat Buchanan and Pat Robertson addressed Christian themes at the Republican National Convention\u2014with Bush criticizing Democrats for omitting God from their platform\u2014many moderates were alienated. Clinton then pointed to his moderate, \"New Democrat\" record as governor of Arkansas, though some on the more liberal side of the party remained suspicious. Many Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and Bush in previous elections switched their support to Clinton. Clinton and his running mate, Al Gore, toured the country during the final weeks of the campaign, shoring up support and pledging a \"new beginning\".\nOn March 26, 1992, during a Democratic fund raiser of the presidential campaign, Robert Rafsky confronted then Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and asked what he was going to do about AIDS, to which Clinton replied, \"I feel your pain.\" The televised exchange led to AIDS becoming an issue in the 1992 presidential election. On April 4, then candidate Clinton met with members of ACT UP and other leading AIDS advocates to discuss his AIDS agenda and agreed to make a major AIDS policy speech, to have people with HIV speak to the Democratic Convention, and to sign onto the AIDS United Action five point plan.\nClinton won the 1992 presidential election (370 electoral votes) against Republican incumbent George H. W. Bush (168 electoral votes) and billionaire populist Ross Perot (zero electoral votes), who ran as an independent on a platform that focused on domestic issues. Bush's steep decline in public approval was a significant part of Clinton's success. Clinton's victory in the election ended twelve years of Republican rule of the White House and twenty of the previous twenty-four years. The election gave Democrats full control of the United States Congress, the first time one party controlled both the executive and legislative branches since Democrats held the 96th United States Congress during the presidency of Jimmy Carter.\nAccording to Seymour Martin Lipset, the 1992 election had several unique characteristics. Voters felt that economic conditions were worse than they actually were, which harmed Bush. A rare event was the presence of a strong third-party candidate. Liberals launched a backlash against 12 years of a conservative White House. The chief factor was Clinton's uniting his party, and winning over a number of heterogeneous groups.\n1996.\nIn the 1996 presidential election, Clinton was re-elected, receiving 49.2 percent of the popular vote over Republican Bob Dole (40.7 percent of the popular vote) and Reform candidate Ross Perot (8.4 percent of the popular vote). Clinton received 379 of the Electoral College votes, with Dole receiving 159 electoral votes. With his victory, he became the first Democrat to win two consecutive presidential elections since Franklin D. Roosevelt.\nPresidency (1993\u20132001).\nClinton's \"third way\" of moderate liberalism built up the nation's fiscal health and put the nation on a firm footing abroad amid globalization and the development of anti-American terrorist organizations.\nDuring his presidency, Clinton advocated for a wide variety of legislation and programs, most of which were enacted into law or implemented by the executive branch. His policies, particularly the North American Free Trade Agreement and welfare reform, have been attributed to a centrist Third Way philosophy of governance. His policy of fiscal conservatism helped to reduce deficits on budgetary matters. Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history.\nThe Congressional Budget Office reported budget surpluses of $69\u00a0billion in 1998, $126\u00a0billion in 1999, and $236\u00a0billion in 2000, during the last three years of Clinton's presidency. Over the years of the recorded surplus, the gross national debt rose each year. At the end of the fiscal year (September 30) for each of the years a surplus was recorded, The U.S. treasury reported a gross debt of $5.413\u00a0trillion in 1997, $5.526\u00a0trillion in 1998, $5.656\u00a0trillion in 1999, and $5.674\u00a0trillion in 2000. Over the same period, the Office of Management and Budget reported an end of year (December 31) gross debt of $5.369\u00a0trillion in 1997, $5.478\u00a0trillion in 1998, $5.606 in 1999, and $5.629\u00a0trillion in 2000. At the end of his presidency, the Clintons moved to 15 Old House Lane in Chappaqua, New York, in order to satisfy a residency requirement for his wife to win election as a U.S. Senator from New York.\nFirst term (1993\u20131997).\nClinton was inaugurated as the 42nd president of the United States on January 20, 1993. Clinton was physically exhausted at the time, and had an inexperienced staff. His high levels of public support dropped in the first few weeks, as he made a series of mistakes. His first choice for attorney general had not paid her taxes on babysitters and was forced to withdraw. The second appointee also withdrew for the same reason. Clinton had repeatedly promised to encourage gays in the military service, despite what he knew to be the strong opposition of the military leadership. He tried anyway, and was publicly opposed by the top generals, and forced by Congress to a compromise position of \"Don't ask, don't tell\" whereby gays could serve if and only if they kept it secret. He devised a $16 billion stimulus package primarily to aid inner-city programs desired by liberals, but it was defeated by a Republican filibuster in the Senate. His popularity at the 100 day mark of his term was the lowest of any president at that point. \nPublic opinion did support one liberal program, and Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993, which required large employers to allow employees to take unpaid leave for pregnancy or a serious medical condition. This action had bipartisan support, and was popular with the public.\nTwo days after taking office, on January 22, 1993\u2014the 20th anniversary of the U.S. Supreme Court decision in \"Roe v. Wade\"\u2014Clinton reversed restrictions on domestic and international family planning programs that had been imposed by Reagan and Bush. Clinton said abortion should be kept \"safe, legal, and rare\"\u2014a slogan that had been suggested by political scientist Samuel L. Popkin and first used by Clinton in December 1991, while campaigning. During the eight years of the Clinton administration, the abortion rate declined by 18 percent.\nOn February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to close a budget deficit. Two days later, in a nationally televised address to a joint session of Congress, Clinton unveiled his economic plan. The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.\nPresident Clinton's attorney general Janet Reno authorized the FBI's use of armored vehicles to deploy tear gas into the buildings of the Branch Davidian community near Waco, Texas, in hopes of ending a 51 day siege. During the operation on April 19, 1993, the buildings caught fire and 75 of the residents died, including 24 children. The raid had originally been planned by the Bush administration; Clinton had played no role.\nOn May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office. This caused the White House travel office controversy even though the travel office staff served at the pleasure of the president and could be dismissed without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming that the firings were done in response to financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation. Critics contended that the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.\nIn August, Clinton signed the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993, which passed Congress without a Republican vote. It cut taxes for 15million low-income families, made tax cuts available to 90\u00a0percent of small businesses, and raised taxes on the wealthiest 1.2\u00a0percent of taxpayers. Additionally, it mandated that the budget be balanced over many years through the implementation of spending restraints.\nOn September 22, 1993, Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding a health care reform plan; the program aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda and resulted from a task force headed by Hillary Clinton. The plan was well received in political circles, but it was eventually doomed by well-organized lobby opposition from conservatives, the American Medical Association, and the health insurance industry. However, Clinton biographer John F. Harris said the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the White House. Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by George J. Mitchell failed to gain a majority of support in August 1994. The failure of the bill was the first major legislative defeat of the Clinton administration.\nIn November 1993, David Hale\u2014the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the Whitewater controversy\u2014alleged that while governor of Arkansas, Clinton pressured Hale to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the Clintons' partner in the Whitewater land deal. A U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation resulted in convictions against the McDougals for their role in the Whitewater project, but the Clintons themselves were never charged, and Clinton maintains his and his wife's innocence in the affair.\nOn November 30, 1993, Clinton signed into law the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks on people who purchase firearms in the United States. The law also imposed a five-day waiting period on purchases, until the NICS system was implemented in 1998. He also expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, a subsidy for low-income workers.\nIn December of the same year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers Larry Patterson and Roger Perry were first reported by David Brock in \"The American Spectator.\" In the affair later known as \"Troopergate\", the officers alleged that they had arranged sexual liaisons for Clinton back when he was governor of Arkansas. The story mentioned a woman named \"Paula\", a reference to Paula Jones. Brock later apologized to Clinton, saying the article was politically motivated \"bad journalism\", and that \"the troopers were greedy and had slimy motives\".\nThat month, Clinton implemented a Department of Defense directive known as \"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\", which allowed gay men and women to serve in the armed services provided they kept their sexual preferences a secret. The Act forbade the military from inquiring about an individual's sexual orientation. The policy was developed as a compromise after Clinton's proposal to allow gays to serve openly in the military met staunch opposition from prominent Congressional Republicans and Democrats, including senators John McCain (R-AZ) and Sam Nunn (D-GA). According to David Mixner, Clinton's support for the compromise led to a heated dispute with Vice President Al Gore, who felt that \"the President should lift the ban\u00a0... even though [his executive order] was sure to be overridden by the Congress\". Some gay-rights advocates criticized Clinton for not going far enough and accused him of making his campaign promise to get votes and contributions. Their position was that Clinton should have integrated the military by executive order, noting that President Harry S. Truman used executive order to racially desegregate the armed forces. Clinton's defenders argued that an executive order might have prompted the Senate to write the exclusion of gays into law, potentially making it harder to integrate the military in the future. Later in his presidency, in 1999, Clinton criticized the way the policy was implemented, saying he did not think any serious person could say it was not \"out of whack\". The policy remained controversial, and was finally repealed in 2011, removing open sexual orientation as a reason for dismissal from the armed forces.\nOn January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the North American Free Trade Agreement into law. Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of Ross Perot. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and one independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the president.\nThe Omnibus Crime Bill, which Clinton signed into law in September 1994, made many changes to U.S. crime and law enforcement legislation including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, \"My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.\" It also included a subsection of assault weapons ban for a ten-year period.\nOn October 21, 1994, the Clinton administration launched the first official White House website, whitehouse.gov. The site was followed with three more versions, resulting in the final edition launched in 2000. The White House website was part of a wider movement of the Clinton administration toward web-based communication. According to Robert Longley, \"Clinton and Gore were responsible for pressing almost all federal agencies, the U.S. court system and the U.S. military onto the Internet, thus opening up America's government to more of America's citizens than ever before. On July 17, 1996, Clinton issued Executive Order 13011\u2014Federal Information Technology, ordering the heads of all federal agencies to utilize information technology fully to make the information of the agency easily accessible to the public.\"\nAfter two years of Democratic Party control, the Democrats lost control of Congress to the Republicans in the mid-term elections in 1994, for the first time in forty years.\nA speech delivered by President Bill Clinton at the December 6, 1995 White House Conference on HIV/AIDS projected that a cure for AIDS and a vaccine to prevent further infection would be developed. The President focused on his administration's accomplishments and efforts related to the epidemic, including an accelerated drug-approval process. He also condemned homophobia and discrimination against people with HIV. Clinton announced three new initiatives: creating a special working group to coordinate AIDS research throughout the Federal government; convening public health experts to develop an action plan that integrates HIV prevention with substance abuse prevention; and launching a new effort by the Department of Justice to ensure that health care facilities provide equal access to people with HIV and AIDS.\nThe White House FBI files controversy of June 1996 arose concerning improper access by the White House to FBI security-clearance documents. Craig Livingstone, head of the White House Office of Personnel Security, improperly requested, and received from the FBI, background report files without asking permission of the subject individuals; many of these were employees of former Republican administrations. In March 2000, Independent Counsel Robert Ray determined there was no credible evidence of any crime. Ray's report further stated, \"there was no substantial and credible evidence that any senior White House official was involved\" in seeking the files.\nOn September 21, 1996, Clinton signed into law the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which defined marriage for federal purposes as the legal union of one man and one woman; the legislation allowed individual states to refuse to recognize gay marriages that were performed in other states. Paul Yandura, speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said Clinton's signing DOMA \"was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election\". In defense of his actions, Clinton has said that DOMA was intended to \"head off an attempt to send a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage to the states\", a possibility he described as highly likely in the context of a \"very reactionary Congress\". Administration spokesman Richard Socarides said, \"the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.\" Clinton himself said DOMA was something \"which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for Bush up, I think it's obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that\". Others were more critical. The veteran gay rights and gay marriage activist Evan Wolfson has called these claims \"historic revisionism\". In a July 2, 2011, editorial \"The New York Times\" opined, \"The Defense of Marriage Act was enacted in 1996 as an election-year wedge issue, signed by President Bill Clinton in one of his worst policy moments.\" Ultimately, in United States v. Windsor, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down DOMA in June 2013.\nDespite DOMA, Clinton was the first president to select openly gay persons for administrative positions, and he is generally credited as being the first president to publicly champion gay rights. During his presidency, Clinton issued two substantially controversial executive orders on behalf of gay rights, the first lifting the ban on security clearances for LGBT federal employees and the second outlawing discrimination based on sexual orientation in the federal civilian workforce. Under Clinton's leadership, federal funding for HIV/AIDS research, prevention and treatment more than doubled. Clinton also pushed for passing hate crimes laws for gays and for the private sector Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which, buoyed by his lobbying, failed to pass the Senate by a single vote in 1996. Advocacy for these issues, paired with the politically unpopular nature of the gay rights movement at the time, led to enthusiastic support for Clinton's election and reelection by the Human Rights Campaign. Clinton came out for gay marriage in July 2009 and urged the Supreme Court to overturn DOMA in 2013. He was later honored by GLAAD for his prior pro-gay stances and his reversal on DOMA.\nThe 1996 United States campaign finance controversy was an alleged effort by China to influence the domestic policies of the United States, before and during the Clinton administration, and involved the fundraising practices of the administration itself. Despite the evidence, the Chinese government denied all accusations.\nAs part of a 1996 initiative to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed by Clinton, the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.\nKen Gormley, author of \"The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr\", reveals in his book that Clinton narrowly escaped possible assassination in the Philippines in November 1996. During his visit to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum in Manila, while he was on his way to meet with a senior member of the Philippine government, Clinton was saved from danger minutes before his motorcade was scheduled to drive over a bridge charged with a timed improvised explosive device (IED). According to officials, the IED was large enough to \"blow up the entire presidential motorcade\". Details of the plot were revealed to Gormley by Lewis C. Merletti, former member of the presidential protection detail and Director of the Secret Service. Intelligence officers intercepted a radio transmission indicating there was a wedding cake under a bridge. This alerted Merletti and others as Clinton's motorcade was scheduled to drive over a major bridge in downtown Manila. Once more, the word \"wedding\" was the code name used by a terrorist group for a past assassination attempt. Merletti wanted to reroute the motorcade, but the alternate route would add forty-five minutes to the drive time. Clinton was very angry, as he was already late for the meeting, but following the advice of the secret service possibly saved his life. Two other bombs had been discovered in Manila earlier in the week so the threat level that day was high. Security personnel at the Manila International Airport uncovered several grenades and a timing device in a travel bag. Officials also discovered a bomb near a major U.S. naval base. The president was scheduled to visit both these locations later in the week. An intense investigation took place into the events in Manila and it was discovered that the group behind the bridge bomb was a Saudi terrorist group in Afghanistan known as al-Qaeda and the plot was masterminded by Osama bin Laden. Until recently, this thwarted assassination attempt was never made public and remained top secret. Only top members of the U.S. intelligence community were aware of these events.\nSecond term (1997\u20132001).\nIn the January 1997, State of the Union address, Clinton proposed a new initiative to provide health coverage to up to five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy\u2014a Democrat\u2014and Orrin Hatch\u2014a Republican\u2014teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in the years of the Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. Bill Clinton negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999, he signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm\u2013Leach\u2013Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass\u2013Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.\nImpeachment and acquittal.\nAfter a House inquiry, Clinton was impeached on December 19, 1998, by the House of Representatives. The House voted 228\u2013206 to impeach him for perjury to a grand jury and voted 221\u2013212 to impeach him for obstruction of justice. Clinton was only the second U.S. president (after Andrew Johnson) to be impeached. Impeachment proceedings were based on allegations that Clinton had illegally lied about and covered up his relationship with 22-year-old White House (and later Department of Defense) employee Monica Lewinsky. After the Starr Report was submitted to the House providing what it termed \"substantial and credible information that President Clinton Committed Acts that May Constitute Grounds for an Impeachment\", the House began impeachment hearings against Clinton before the mid-term elections. To hold impeachment proceedings, the Republican leadership called a lame-duck session in December 1998.\nWhile the House Judiciary Committee hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for perjury and obstruction of justice. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony before a grand jury that had been convened to investigate perjury he may have committed in his sworn deposition during \"Jones v. Clinton,\" Paula Jones's sexual harassment lawsuit. The obstruction charge was based on his actions to conceal his relationship with Lewinsky before and after that deposition.\nThe Senate later acquitted Clinton of both charges. The Senate refused to meet to hold an impeachment trial before the end of the old term, so the trial was held over until the next Congress. Clinton was represented by Washington law firm Williams &amp; Connolly. The Senate finished a twenty-one-day trial on February 12, 1999, with the vote of 55 not guilty/45 guilty on the perjury charge and 50 not guilty/50 guilty on the obstruction of justice charge. Both votes fell short of the constitutional two-thirds majority requirement to convict and remove an officeholder. The final vote was generally along party lines, with no Democrats voting guilty, and only a handful of Republicans voting not guilty.\nOn January 19, 2001, Clinton's law license was suspended for five years after he acknowledged to an Arkansas circuit court that he had engaged in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice in the \"Jones\" case.\nPardons and commutations.\nClinton issued 141 pardons and 36 commutations on his last day in office on January 20, 2001. Controversy surrounded Marc Rich and allegations that Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham, accepted payments in return for influencing the president's decision-making regarding the pardons. Federal prosecutor Mary Jo White was appointed to investigate the pardon of Rich. She was later replaced by then-Republican James Comey. The investigation found no wrongdoing on Clinton's part. Clinton also pardoned 4 defendants in the Whitewater Scandal, Chris Wade, Susan McDougal, Stephen Smith, and Robert W. Palmer, all of whom had ties to Clinton when he was governor of Arkansas. Former Clinton HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros, who pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, was also among Clinton's pardons.\nCampaign finance controversies.\nIn February 1997 it was discovered upon documents being released by the Clinton Administration that 938 people had stayed at the White House and that 821 of them had made donations to the Democratic Party and got the opportunity to stay in the Lincoln bedroom as a result of the donations. Some donors included Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks, Jane Fonda, and Judy Collins. Top donors also got golf games and morning jogs with Clinton as a result of the contributions. Janet Reno was called on to investigate the matter by Trent Lott, but she refused.\nIn 1996,\u00a0it was found that several Chinese foreigners made contributions to Clinton's reelection campaign and the Democratic National Committee with the backing of the People's Republic of China. Some of them also attempted to donate to Clinton's defense fund. This violated United States law forbidding non-American citizens from making campaign contributions. Clinton and Al Gore also allegedly met with the foreign donors. A Republican investigation led by Fred Thompson found that Clinton was targeted by the Chinese government. However, Democratic senators Joe Lieberman and John Glenn said that the evidence showed that China only targeted congressional elections and not presidential elections.\nMilitary and foreign affairs.\nSomalia.\nThe Battle of Mogadishu occurred in Somalia in 1993. During the operation, two U.S. helicopters were shot down by rocket-propelled grenade attacks to their tail rotors, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets\u2014a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.\nRwanda.\nIn April 1994, genocide broke out in Rwanda. Intelligence reports indicate that Clinton was aware a \"final solution to eliminate all Tutsis\" was underway, long before the administration publicly used the word \"genocide\". Fearing a reprisal of the events in Somalia the previous year, Clinton chose not to intervene. Clinton has called his failure to intervene one of his main foreign policy failings, saying \"I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it.\"\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\nIn 1995, U.S. and NATO aircraft bombed Bosnian Serb targets to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and pressure them into a peace accord that would end the Bosnian war. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent Dayton Agreement.\nIrish peace talks.\nIn 1992, before his presidency, Clinton proposed sending a peace envoy to Northern Ireland, but this was dropped to avoid tensions with the British government. In November 1995, in a ceasefire during the Troubles, Clinton became the first president to visit Northern Ireland, examining both of the two divided communities of Belfast. Despite unionist criticism, Clinton used this as a way to negotiate an end to the violent conflict with London, Dublin, the paramilitaries and the other groups. Clinton went on to play a key role in the peace talks, which produced the Good Friday Agreement in 1998.\nIran.\nIn February 1996, the Clinton administration agreed to pay Iran US$131.8million (equivalent to $\u00a0million in ) in settlement to discontinue a case brought by Iran in 1989 against the U.S. in the International Court of Justice after the shooting down of Iran Air Flight 655 by the U.S. Navy guided missile cruiser.\nOsama bin Laden.\nCapturing Osama bin Laden had been an objective of the U.S. government during the presidency of Bill Clinton (and continued to be until bin Laden's death in 2011). Despite claims by Mansoor Ijaz and Sudanese officials that the Sudanese government had offered to arrest and extradite bin Laden, and that U.S. authorities rejected each offer, the 9/11 Commission Report stated that \"we have not found any reliable evidence to support the Sudanese claim\".\nIn response to a 1996 State Department warning about bin Laden and the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in East Africa by al-Qaeda (which killed 224 people, including 12 Americans), Clinton ordered several military missions to capture or kill bin Laden, all of which were unsuccessful. In August 1998, Clinton ordered cruise missile strikes on terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, targeting the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory in Sudan, which was suspected of assisting bin Laden in making chemical weapons, and bin Laden's terrorist training camps in Afghanistan.\nKosovo.\nIn the midst of a brutal crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists in the province of Kosovo by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, Clinton authorized the use of U.S. Armed Forces in a NATO bombing campaign against Yugoslavia in 1999, named Operation Allied Force. The stated reasoning behind the intervention was to stop the ethnic cleansing (and what the Clinton administration labeled genocide) of Albanians by Yugoslav anti-guerilla military units. General Wesley Clark was Supreme Allied Commander of NATO and oversaw the mission. With United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, the bombing campaign ended on June 10, 1999. The resolution placed Kosovo under UN administration and authorized a peacekeeping force to be deployed to the region. NATO announced its soldiers all survived combat, though two died in an Apache helicopter crash. Journalists in the popular press criticized genocide statements by the Clinton administration as false and greatly exaggerated. Prior to the bombing campaign on March 24, 1999, common estimates showed that the number of civilians killed in the over year long conflict in Kosovo had approximately been 1,800, of which were primarily Albanians but also Serbs and that there was no evidence of genocide or ethnic cleansing. In a post-war inquiry, the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe noted \"the patterns of the expulsions and the vast increase in lootings, killings, rape, kidnappings and pillage once the NATO air war began on March 24\". In 2001, the U.N.-supervised Supreme Court of Kosovo ruled that genocide (the intent to destroy a people) did not take place, but recognized \"a systematic campaign of terror, including murders, rapes, arsons and severe maltreatments\" with the intention being the forceful departure of the Albanian population. The term \"ethnic cleansing\" was used as an alternative to \"genocide\" to denote not just ethnically motivated murder but also displacement, though critics charge there is little difference. Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107, the president of Yugoslavia at the time of the atrocities, was eventually brought to trial before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in the Hague on charges including crimes against humanity and war crimes for his role in the war. He died in 2006, before the completion of the trial.\nIraq.\nIn Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address, he warned Congress that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein was building an arsenal of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.\nClinton signed the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of \"regime change\" against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces. The administration then launched a four-day bombing campaign named Operation Desert Fox, lasting from December 16 to 19, 1998. At the end of this operation Clinton announced that \"So long as Saddam remains in power, he will remain a threat to his people, his region, and the world. With our allies, we must pursue a strategy to contain him and to constrain his weapons of mass destruction program, while working toward the day Iraq has a government willing to live at peace with its people and with its neighbors.\" American and British aircraft in the Iraq no-fly zones attacked hostile Iraqi air defenses 166 times in 1999 and 78 times in 2000.\nChina.\nOn October 10, 2000, Clinton signed into law the U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000, which granted permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) trade status to China. The president asserted that free trade would gradually open China to democratic reform.\nRelations were damaged briefly by the American bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade in May 1999. Clinton apologized for the bombing, stating it was accidental.\nThe U.S.\u2013China Relations Act of 2000 granted China permanent normal trade relations (NTR) status (previously called most favoured nation (MFN)) when China becomes a full member of the World Trade Organization (WTO), ending annual review and approval of NTR. The Act was signed into law on October 10, 2000, by Clinton. President Clinton in 2000 pushed Congress to approve the U.S.-China trade agreement and China's accession to the WTO, saying that more trade with China would advance America's economic interests: \"Economically, this agreement is the equivalent of a one-way street. It requires China to open its markets\u2014with a fifth of the world's population, potentially the biggest markets in the world\u2014to both our products and services in unprecedented new ways,\" said Clinton.\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict.\nAfter initial successes such as the Oslo Accords of the early 1990s, which also led to the Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty in 1994 and the Wye River Memorandum in October 1998, Clinton attempted an effort to end the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict. He brought Israeli prime minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority chairman Yasser Arafat together at Camp David for the Camp David Summit in July 2000, which lasted 14 days. Following the failures of the peace talks, Clinton said Arafat had \"missed the opportunity\" to facilitate a \"just and lasting peace\". In his autobiography, Clinton blames Arafat for the collapse of the summit. Following another attempt in December 2000 at Bolling Air Force Base, in which the president offered the Clinton Parameters, the situation broke down completely after the end of the Taba Summit and with the start of the Second Intifada.\nJudicial appointments.\nClinton appointed two justices to the Supreme Court: Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 1993 and Stephen Breyer in 1994. Both justices went on to serve until the 2020s, leaving a lasting judicial legacy for President Clinton.\nClinton was the first president in history to appoint more women and minority judges than white male judges to the federal courts. In his eight years in office, 11.6% of Clinton's court of appeals nominees and 17.4% of his district court nominees were black; 32.8% of his court of appeals nominees and 28.5% of his district court nominees were women.\nPublic opinion.\nThroughout Clinton's first term, his job approval rating fluctuated in the 40s and 50s. In his second term, his rating consistently ranged from the high-50s to the high-60s. After his impeachment proceedings in 1998 and 1999, Clinton's rating reached its highest point. According to a CBS News/\"New York Times\" poll, Clinton left office with an approval rating of 68\u00a0percent, which matched those of Ronald Reagan and Franklin D. Roosevelt as the highest ratings for departing presidents in the modern era. Clinton's average Gallup poll approval rating for his last quarter in office was 61%, the highest final quarter rating any president has received for fifty years. Forty-seven percent of the respondents identified themselves as being Clinton supporters.\nAs he was leaving office, a CNN/\"USA Today\"/Gallup poll revealed that 45\u00a0percent of Americans said they would miss him; 55\u00a0percent thought he \"would have something worthwhile to contribute and should remain active in public life\"; 68\u00a0percent thought he would be remembered more for his \"involvement in personal scandal\" than for \"his accomplishments\"; and 58\u00a0percent answered \"No\" to the question \"Do you generally think Bill Clinton is honest and trustworthy?\" The same percentage said he would be remembered as either \"outstanding\" or \"above average\" as a president, while 22\u00a0percent said he would be remembered as \"below average\" or \"poor\". ABC News characterized public consensus on Clinton as, \"You can't trust him, he's got weak morals and ethics\u2014and he's done a heck of a good job.\"\nIn May 2006, a CNN poll comparing Clinton's job performance with that of his successor, George W. Bush, found that a strong majority of respondents said Clinton outperformed Bush in six different areas questioned. Gallup polls in 2007 and 2011 showed that Clinton was regarded by 13 percent of Americans as the greatest president in U.S. history.\nIn 2014, 18 percent of respondents in a Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll of American voters regarded Clinton as the best president since World War II, making him the third most popular among postwar presidents, behind John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan. The same poll showed that just 3% of American voters regarded Clinton as the worst president since World War II.\nA 2015 poll by \"The Washington Post\" asked 162 scholars of the American Political Science Association to rank all the U.S. presidents in order of greatness. According to their findings, Clinton ranked eighth overall, with a rating of 70 percent.\nPublic image.\nClinton was the first baby boomer president. Authors Martin Walker and Bob Woodward stated that Clinton's innovative use of sound bite-ready dialogue, personal charisma, and public perception-oriented campaigning were a major factor in his high public approval ratings. When Clinton played the saxophone on \"The Arsenio Hall Show\", he was described by some religious conservatives as \"the MTV president\". Opponents sometimes referred to him as \"Slick Willie\", a nickname which was first applied to him in 1980 by \"Pine Bluff Commercial\" journalist Paul Greenberg; Greenberg believed that Clinton was abandoning the progressive policies of previous Arkansas Governors such as Winthrop Rockefeller, Dale Bumpers and David Pryor. The claim \"Slick Willie\" would last throughout his presidency. His folksy manner led him to be nicknamed Bubba, especially in the South. Since 2000, he has frequently been referred to as \"The Big Dog\" or \"Big Dog\". His prominent role in campaigning for President Obama during the 2012 presidential election and his widely publicized speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention, where he officially nominated Obama and criticized Republican nominee Mitt Romney and Republican policies in detail, earned him the nickname \"Explainer-in-Chief\".\nClinton drew strong support from the African American community and insisted that the improvement of race relations would be a major theme of his presidency. In 1998, Nobel laureate Toni Morrison called Clinton \"the first Black president\", saying, \"Clinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald's-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas\". Morrison noted that Clinton's sex life was scrutinized more than his career accomplishments, and she compared this to the stereotyping and double standards that, she said, blacks typically endure. Many viewed this comparison as unfair and disparaging both to Clinton and to the African-American community at large. Clinton, a Baptist, has been open about his faith.\nSexual assault and misconduct allegations.\nSeveral women have publicly accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, including rape, harassment, and sexual assault. Additionally, some commentators have characterized Clinton's sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky as predatory or non-consensual, despite the fact that Lewinsky called the relationship consensual at the time. These allegations have been revisited and lent more credence in 2018, in light of the #MeToo movement, with many commentators and Democratic leaders now saying Clinton should have been compelled to resign after the Lewinsky affair.\nIn 1994, Paula Jones initiated a sexual harassment lawsuit against Clinton, claiming he had made unwanted advances towards her in 1991; Clinton denied the allegations. In April 1998, the case was initially dismissed by Judge Susan Webber Wright on the grounds that it lacked legal merit. Jones appealed Webber Wright's ruling, and her suit gained traction following Clinton's admission to having an affair with Monica Lewinsky in August 1998. In 1998, lawyers for Paula Jones released court documents that alleged a pattern of sexual harassment by Clinton when he was Governor of Arkansas. Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's main lawyer for the case, called the filing \"a pack of lies\" and \"an organized campaign to smear the President of the United States\" funded by Clinton's political enemies. Clinton later agreed to an out-of-court settlement and paid Jones $850,000. Bennett said the president made the settlement only so he could end the lawsuit for good and move on with his life. During the deposition for the Jones lawsuit, which was held at the White House, Clinton denied having sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky\u2014a denial that became the basis for an impeachment charge of perjury.\nIn 1998, Kathleen Willey alleged that Clinton had groped her in a hallway in 1993. An independent counsel determined Willey gave \"false information\" to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by Kenneth Starr to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.\nAlso in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick alleged that Clinton had raped her in the spring of 1978, although she said she did not remember the exact date. To support her charge, Broaddrick notes that she told multiple witnesses in 1978 she had been raped by Clinton, something these witnesses also state in interviews to the press. Broaddrick had earlier filed an affidavit denying any \"unwelcome sexual advances\" and later repeated the denial in a sworn deposition. In a 1998 NBC interview wherein she detailed the alleged rape, Broaddrick said she had denied (under oath) being raped only to avoid testifying about the ordeal publicly.\nThe Lewinsky scandal has had an enduring impact on Clinton's legacy, beyond his impeachment in 1998. In the wake of the #MeToo movement (which shed light on the widespread prevalence of sexual assault and harassment, especially in the workplace), various commentators and Democratic political leaders, as well as Lewinsky herself, have revisited their view that the Lewinsky affair was consensual, and instead characterized it as an abuse of power or harassment, in light of the power differential between a president and a 22-year old intern. In 2018, Clinton was asked in several interviews about whether he should have resigned, and he said he had made the right decision in not resigning. During the 2018 Congressional elections, \"The New York Times\" alleged that having no Democratic candidate for office asking Clinton to campaign with them was a change that attributed to the revised understanding of the Lewinsky scandal. However, former DNC interim chair Donna Brazile previously urged Clinton in November 2017 to campaign during the 2018 midterm elections, in spite of New York U.S. senator Kirsten Gillibrand's recent criticism of the Lewinsky scandal.\nAlleged affairs.\nClinton admitted to having extramarital affairs with singer Gennifer Flowers and Monica Lewinsky. Actress Elizabeth Gracen, Miss Arkansa winner Sally Perdue, and Dolly Kyle Browning all claimed that they had affairs with Clinton during his time as governor of Arkansas. Browning would later sue Clinton, Bruce Lindsey, Robert S. Bennett, and Jane Mayer alleging they engaged in a conspiracy to attempt to block her from publishing a book loosely based on her relationship with Clinton and tried to defame him. However Browning's lawsuit was dismissed. \nPost-presidency (2001\u2013present).\nBill Clinton has continued to be active in public life since leaving office in 2001, giving speeches, fundraising, and founding charitable organizations, and has spoken in prime time at every Democratic National Convention.\nActivities until 2008 campaign.\nIn 2002, Clinton warned that pre-emptive military action against Iraq would have unwelcome consequences, and later claimed to have opposed the Iraq War from the start (though some dispute this). In 2005, Clinton criticized the Bush administration for its handling of emissions control, while speaking at the United Nations Climate Change conference in Montreal.\nThe William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park in Little Rock, Arkansas, was dedicated in 2004. Clinton released a best-selling autobiography, \"My Life\", in 2004. In 2007, he released \"\", which also became a \"New York Times\" Best Seller and garnered positive reviews.\nIn the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, U.N. secretary-general Kofi Annan appointed Clinton to head a relief effort. After Hurricane Katrina, Clinton joined with fellow former president George H. W. Bush to establish the Bush-Clinton Tsunami Fund in January 2005, and the Bush-Clinton Katrina Fund in October of that year. As part of the tsunami effort, these two ex-presidents appeared in a Super Bowl XXXIX pre-game show, and traveled to the affected areas. They also spoke together at the funeral of Boris Yeltsin in April 2007.\nBased on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton created the William J. Clinton Foundation to address issues of global importance. This foundation includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and has worked with the Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict. In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugary drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from many governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30\u00a0percent in developing nations. Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.\nIn the early 2000s, Clinton took flights on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet in connection with Clinton Foundation work. Years later, Epstein was convicted on sex trafficking charges. Clinton's office released a statement in 2019 saying, \"President Clinton knows nothing about the terrible crimes Jeffrey Epstein pleaded guilty to in Florida some years ago, or those with which he has been recently charged in New York. In 2002 and 2003, President Clinton took four trips on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane: one to Europe, one to Asia, and two to Africa, which included stops in connection with the work of the Clinton Foundation. Staff, supporters of the Foundation, and his Secret Service detail traveled on every leg of every trip. [...] He's not spoken to Epstein in well over a decade.\"\n2008 presidential election.\nDuring the 2008 Democratic presidential primary campaign, Clinton vigorously advocated on behalf of his wife, Hillary. Through speaking engagements and fundraisers, he was able to raise $10\u00a0million toward her campaign. Some worried that as an ex-president, he was too active on the trail, too negative to Clinton rival Barack Obama, and alienating his supporters at home and abroad. Many were especially critical of him following his remarks in the South Carolina primary, which Obama won. Later in the 2008 primaries, there was some infighting between Bill and Hillary's staffs, especially in Pennsylvania. Considering Bill's remarks, many thought he could not rally Hillary supporters behind Obama after Obama won the primary. Such remarks lead to apprehension that the party would be split to the detriment of Obama's election. Fears were allayed August 27, 2008, when Clinton enthusiastically endorsed Obama at the 2008 Democratic National Convention, saying all his experience as president assures him that Obama is \"ready to lead\". After Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign was over, Bill Clinton continued to raise funds to help pay off her campaign debt.\nAfter the 2008 election.\nIn 2009, Clinton travelled to North Korea on behalf of two American journalists imprisoned there. Euna Lee and Laura Ling had been imprisoned for illegally entering the country from China. Jimmy Carter had made a similar visit in 1994. After Clinton met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-il, Kim issued a pardon.\nSince then, Clinton has been assigned many other diplomatic missions. He was named United Nations Special Envoy to Haiti in 2009 following a series of hurricanes which caused $1\u00a0billion in damages. Clinton organized a conference with the Inter-American Development Bank, where a new industrial park was discussed in an effort to \"build back better\". In response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake, U.S. president Barack Obama announced that Clinton and George W. Bush would coordinate efforts to raise funds for Haiti's recovery. Funds began pouring into Haiti, which led to funding becoming available for Caracol Industrial Park in a part of the country unaffected by the earthquake. While Hillary Clinton was in South Korea, she and Cheryl Mills worked to convince SAE-A, a large apparel subcontractor, to invest in Haiti despite the company's deep concerns about plans to raise the minimum wage. In the summer of 2010, the South Korean company signed a contract at the U.S. State Department, ensuring that the new industrial park would have a key tenant. In 2010, Clinton announced support of, and delivered the keynote address for, the inauguration of NTR, Ireland's first environmental foundation. At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, Clinton gave a widely praised speech nominating Barack Obama.\n2016 presidential election and after.\nDuring the 2016 presidential election, Clinton again encouraged voters to support Hillary, and made appearances speaking on the campaign trail. In a series of tweets, then-President-elect Donald Trump criticized his ability to get people out to vote. Clinton served as a member of the electoral college for the state of New York. He voted for the Democratic ticket consisting of his wife Hillary and her running-mate Tim Kaine.\nOn September 7, 2017, Clinton partnered with former presidents Jimmy Carter, George H. W. Bush, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama to work with One America Appeal to help the victims of Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in the Gulf Coast and Texas communities.\nIn 2020, Clinton again served as a member of the United States Electoral College from New York, casting his vote for the successful Democratic ticket of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.\nPost-presidential health concerns.\nIn September 2004, Clinton underwent quadruple bypass surgery. In March 2005, he again underwent surgery, this time for a partially collapsed lung. On February 11, 2010, he was rushed to New York-Presbyterian/Columbia Hospital in Manhattan after complaining of chest pains, and he had two coronary stents implanted in his heart. After this procedure, Clinton adopted a plant-based whole foods (vegan) diet, which had been recommended by doctors Dean Ornish and Caldwell Esselstyn. However, he has since incorporated fish and lean proteins at the suggestion of Dr. Mark Hyman, a proponent of the pseudoscientific ethos of functional medicine. As a result, he is no longer a strict vegan.\nIn October 2021, Clinton was treated for sepsis at the University of California, Irvine Medical Center.\nWealth.\nThe Clintons incurred several million dollars in legal bills during his presidency, which were paid off four years after he left office. Bill and Hillary Clinton have each earned millions of dollars from book publishing. In 2016, \"Forbes\" reported Bill and Hillary Clinton made about $240million in the 15years from January 2001, to December 2015, (mostly from paid speeches, business consulting and book-writing). Also in 2016, CNN reported the Clintons combined to receive more than $153million in paid speeches from 2001 until spring 2015. In May 2015, \"The Hill\" reported that Bill and Hillary Clinton have made more than $25million in speaking fees since the start of 2014, and that Hillary Clinton also made $5million or more from her book, \"Hard Choices\", during the same time period. In July 2014, \"The Wall Street Journal\" reported that at the end of 2012, the Clintons were worth between $5million and $25.5million, and that in 2012 (the last year they were required to disclose the information) the Clintons made between $16 and $17million, mostly from speaking fees earned by the former president. Clinton earned more than $104million from paid speeches between 2001 and 2012. In June 2014, ABC News and \"The Washington Post\" reported that Bill Clinton has made more than $100million giving paid speeches since leaving public office, and in 2008, \"The New York Times\" reported that the Clintons' income tax returns show they made $109million in the eight years from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2007, including almost $92million from his speaking and book-writing.\nBill Clinton has given dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to corporations and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech. Russian investment bank with ties to the Kremlin paid Clinton $500,000 for a speech in Moscow. Hillary Clinton said she and Bill came out of the White House financially \"broke\" and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. \"We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education.\" She added, \"Bill has worked really hard\u00a0... we had to pay off all our debts\u00a0... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members.\"\nPersonal life.\nAt the age of 10, he was baptized at Park Place Baptist Church in Hot Springs, Arkansas and remained a member of a Baptist church. In 2007, with Jimmy Carter, he founded the New Baptist Covenant Baptist organization.\nOn October 11, 1975, in Fayetteville, Arkansas, he married Hillary Rodham, whom he met while studying at Yale University. They had Chelsea Clinton, their only child, on February 27, 1980. He is the maternal grandfather to Chelsea's three children.\nHonors and recognition.\nVarious colleges and universities have awarded Clinton honorary degrees, including Doctorate of Law degrees and Doctor of Humane Letters degrees. He received an honorary degree from Georgetown University, his alma mater, and was the commencement speaker in 1980. He is an honorary fellow of University College, Oxford, which he attended as a Rhodes Scholar, although he did not complete his studies there. Schools have been named for Clinton, and statues have been built to pay him homage. U.S. states where he has been honored include Missouri, Arkansas, Kentucky, and New York. He was presented with the Medal for Distinguished Public Service by Secretary of Defense William Cohen in 2001. The Clinton Presidential Center was opened in Little Rock, Arkansas, in his honor on December 5, 2001.\nHe has been honored in various other ways, in countries that include the Czech Republic, Papua New Guinea, Germany, and Kosovo. The Republic of Kosovo, in gratitude for his help during the Kosovo War, renamed a major street in the capital city of Pristina as Bill Clinton Boulevard and added a monumental Clinton statue.\nClinton was selected as \"Time\" \"Man of the Year\" in 1992, and again in 1998, along with Ken Starr. From a poll conducted of the American people in December 1999, Clinton was among eighteen included in Gallup's List of Widely Admired People of the 20th century. He was honored with a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children, a J. William Fulbright Prize for International Understanding, a TED Prize (named for the confluence of technology, entertainment and design), and was named as an Honorary GLAAD Media Award recipient for his work as an advocate for the LGBT community.\nIn 2011, President Michel Martelly of Haiti awarded Clinton with the National Order of Honour and Merit to the rank of Grand Cross \"for his various initiatives in Haiti and especially his high contribution to the reconstruction of the country after the earthquake of January 12, 2010\". Clinton declared at the ceremony that \"in the United States of America, I really don't believe former American presidents need awards anymore, but I am very honored by this one, I love Haiti, and I believe in its promise\".\nU.S. president Barack Obama awarded Clinton the Presidential Medal of Freedom on November 20, 2013.\nRecordings.\nBill Clinton is one of the narrators on \"Wolf Tracks and Peter and the Wolf\", a 2003 recording of Sergei Prokofiev's \"Peter and the Wolf\" performed by the Russian National Orchestra, on Pentatone, together with Mikhail Gorbachev and Sophia Loren. This garnered Clinton the 2003 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children.\nThe audiobook edition of his autobiography, \"My Life\", read by Clinton himself, won the 2005 Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album as well as the Audie Award as the Audiobook of the Year.\nClinton has two more Grammy nominations for his audiobooks: \"\" in 2007 and \"Back to Work\" in 2012."}
{"title": "Kris_Kobach", "label": "Politician", "text": "Kris William Kobach (; born March 26, 1966) is an American lawyer and politician who served as the 31st Secretary of State of Kansas. A former Chairman of the Kansas Republican Party, Kobach came to national prominence over his far-right anti-immigration views, including involvement in the implementation of high-profile anti-immigration ordinances in various American cities. Kobach is also known for his calls for stronger voter ID laws in the United States, a national registry of Muslims in the United States, and his advocacy for anti-abortion legislation. He has made claims about the extent of voter fraud in the United States that studies and fact-checkers have concluded are false or unsubstantiated.\nKobach began his political career as a member of the City Council of Overland Park, Kansas. He was later the Republican nominee in Kansas's 3rd congressional district in the 2004 election, losing to Democratic incumbent Dennis Moore. He was elected Secretary of State of Kansas in 2010.\nAs Secretary of State of Kansas, Kobach implemented some of the strictest voter identification laws in the history of the United States and fought to remove nearly 20,000 registered voters from the state's voter rolls. Following considerable investigation and prosecution, Kobach secured nine convictions for voter fraud; all were cases of double voting, and most involved voters who claimed to have misunderstood their voting rights.\nKobach announced in June 2017 that he would run in the 2018 primary for Governor of Kansas against then-Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer, who became the Governor in January 2018 following the resignation of Sam Brownback. After narrowly defeating Colyer in the Republican primary by less than 500 votes, Kobach was defeated by Democrat Laura Kelly in the general election. In July 2019, Kobach launched his campaign for the U.S. Senate in the 2020 campaign after Senator Pat Roberts announced his retirement. Upon the campaign's launch, Kobach implied he had Trump's support. Kobach's main opponent in the Republican primary August 4 was U.S. Representative Roger Marshall, who received 40 percent of the vote to Kobach's 26 percent; nine other candidates split the remaining 33.5 percent of the vote. He has filed paperwork to run for Kansas Attorney General in 2022.\nEarly life, education, and academic career.\nKobach was born in Madison, Wisconsin on March 26, 1966. His family moved to Topeka, Kansas when he was just three years old, where his father owned a Buick dealership, that Kobach worked at while in high school. In 1984, Kobach graduated from Washburn Rural High School in Topeka, Kansas, where he was co-valedictorian, and the student body class president. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in Government from Harvard University, graduating \"summa cum laude\" and first in his department. The director of Harvard's Center for International Affairs, Professor Samuel P. Huntington, was Kobach's faculty advisor from 1984 to 1988. Huntington believed that migration, especially from Mexico and Latin America, represented the most perilous threat to what he called the \"American identity.\" When Kobach taught law at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, Huntington's writings were required reading in the course. From Harvard, Kobach went on to earn a Doctor of Philosophy in politics from Brasenose College of Oxford University, having been selected for a Marshall Scholarship. Returning to the U.S., he earned a J.D. from Yale Law School in 1995, and became an editor of the \"Yale Law Journal.\" During this time, Kobach published two books: \"The Referendum: Direct Democracy in Switzerland\" (Dartmouth, 1994), and \"Political Capital: The Motives, Tactics, and Goals of Politicized Businesses in South Africa\" (University Press of America, 1990).\nLegal career.\nFrom 1995 to 1996, Kobach clerked for Judge Deanell R. Tacha of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Lawrence, Kansas. He began his professorship at the University of Missouri\u2013Kansas City School of Law (UMKC) shortly thereafter. In 2001, President George W. Bush awarded him a White House Fellowship to work for Attorney General John Ashcroft. At the end of the fellowship, he stayed on as Counsel to the Attorney General. Shortly after the attacks of September 11, 2001, he led a team of attorneys and researchers who formulated and established the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System. In addition, he took part in work to reshape the Board of Immigration Appeals in 2002. After his government service ended, he returned to UMKC to teach law until he was elected Kansas Secretary of State.\nImmigration-related activism.\nLitigation.\nWhile running for Congress in 2004, Kobach represented out-of-state students on behalf of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR), in a lawsuit against the state of Kansas, challenging a state law which grants in-state tuition to undocumented immigrants. The suit was dismissed for lack of legal standing for the plaintiffs. In 2005, Kobach filed a lawsuit on behalf of FAIR's Immigration Reform Law Institute (IRLI), challenging a similar law in California. In September 2008, the California Court of Appeal held that California's law granting in-state tuition rates to undocumented immigrants was preempted by federal law. (Martinez v. Regents, 166 Cal. App. 4th 1121; 2008). In November 2010, the California Supreme Court unanimously reversed, finding that the law was not so preempted, because it was based on attendance for three years and graduation from a California high school.\nIn 2010, Kobach filed a third similar tuition lawsuit, this time in Nebraska. The case was dismissed in a Nebraska district court in December of that year, for plaintiffs' lack of legal standing.\nKobach has litigated numerous lawsuits defending cities and states that adopt laws to discourage illegal immigration. He served as lead lawyer defending the city of Valley Park, Missouri in a federal case concerning an ordinance that requires businesses to use a federal worker verification program known as E-Verify in order to maintain a business license. The ordinance was upheld by Missouri federal judge E. Richard Webber on January 31, 2008 (\"Gray v. Valley Park\", 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 7238). The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), representing the plaintiff, appealed the case to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals. Kobach prevailed on appeal, and the Court allowed the Valley Park ordinance to stand (\"Gray v. Valley Park\", 567 F.3d 976 (8th Cir. 2009)), saying that the ordinance \"addresses the employment of illegal aliens, not Hispanics.\"\nKobach was the lead attorney defending the city of Hazleton, Pennsylvania, whose ordinances prohibiting employing and renting to illegal immigrants had been struck down by a federal judge in Pennsylvania and again before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. In June 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court vacated the Third Circuit's decision and remitted the case back to the Third Circuit for reconsideration. Sup. Ct. No 10-722. In July 2013, the Third Circuit concluded again that both the employment and housing provisions of the Hazleton ordinances were preempted by federal immigration law.\nKobach became counsel in another lawsuit, in part involving a Farmers Branch, Texas ordinance that attempted to prevent landlords from renting to illegal immigrants. That case was appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals where it was first heard by a three judge panel that largely decided against the city. In addition to the costs of the immigration suits, the City had spent $850,000 defending two voting rights lawsuits. The City appealed the panel's ruling, in Case No. 10-10751, with the Fifth Circuit granting an \"en banc\" rehearing by the entire Court . After losing there with the costs to the City by that December reaching $6.1 million, the City appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which refused to hear its appeal in 2014. The city had engaged Kobach to help write the ordinance in October 2006. The plaintiffs in the case, including the Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), the ACLU and the ACLU's National Immigrants' Rights Project, were awarded $1.4 million in June 2014.\nAs of January 2011, it was estimated that Kobach had received $6.6 million from jurisdictions as he defended their anti-immigration ordinances he had helped to create and/or defend.\nIn 2011, the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) compared him to Harold Hill, the central character of the \"Music Man,\" writing: \"Like Hill\u2026Kobach comes to town with big ideas and a can-do attitude but leaves behind a trail of tears\u200a\u2014\u200ahuge legal bills and unworkable laws coupled with social turmoil.\" In an August 2, 2017 sendup, comedian Samantha Bee made the same comparison, in an episode of her \"Full Frontal with Samantha Bee\" television show, singing the Hill/Kobach part herself, with \"Hamilton's\" Javier Mu\u00f1oz appearing as the hectored immigrant.\nAs of September 2017, Kobach was listed as \"Of counsel\" by IRLI, the legal arm of FAIR, which is described as a \"hate group,\" by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\nIn August 2018, \"ProPublica\" and \"The Kansas City Star\" reported that none of the towns where Kobach helped to enact anti-immigration ordinances over a 13-year period still had those ordinances on the books. The ordinances were costly to defend in court, with some localities going bankrupt. At the same time, Kobach personally profited, earning more than $800,000 on legal work for the localities over a 13-year period, paid both by the localities and an anti-immigration advocacy group.\nArizona immigration law.\nKobach played a significant role in the drafting of Arizona SB 1070, a state law that attracted national attention as the country's broadest and strictest\u2014at the state level\u2014illegal immigration measure, and has assisted in defending the state during the ongoing legal battle over SB 1070's legality. On February 7, 2008, Federal Judge Neil V. Wake ruled against a lawsuit filed by construction contractors and immigrant organizations who sought to halt a state law that imposes severe penalties on employers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants. The plaintiffs appealed the ruling, but Arizona prevailed (with Kobach's assistance) in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (\"Chicanos por la Causa v. Arizona\", 558 F.3d 856; 2009). The case was further appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on the case \"Arizona v. United States\", upholding the provision requiring immigration status checks during law enforcement stops but striking down three other provisions as violations of the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.\nA 2015 ruling by the United States District Court for the District of Arizona limited the effectiveness of the lone provision of SB 1070 that had been upheld as constitutional. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had hired Kobach, lost re-election in 2016. The suit cost the county over $56,000,000 in legal fees and costs. During this litigation, it was revealed that Kobach was paid $300 per hour to train the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office in regard to immigration matters.\nAlabama immigration law.\nKobach was cited as a primary author of Alabama HB 56, passed in 2010, which was described as tougher than Arizona's law. Much of the law was invalidated on appeal at various levels of appeals courts or voluntarily withdrawn or reworded.\nBorder security initiatives.\nKobach visited Coolidge, Arizona to observe North Dakota's Fisher Industries demonstration of how it would build a border fence. Fisher maintained it could erect 218 miles of the barrier for $3.3 billion and be able to complete it in 13 months. Spin cameras positioned atop the fence would use facial recognition technology. Fiber optic cables buried in the ground could detect and differentiate between human activity, vehicles, tunneling, and animals as distant as 40 feet away. The Arizona barrier would be constructed with 42 miles near Yuma and 91 miles near Tucson, Arizona, plus 69 miles near El Paso, Texas, and 15 more miles near El Centro, California. It would reportedly cost $12.5 million per mile. Louisiana Republican U.S. Senator Bill Cassidy said he traveled with the group of politicians over the Easter recess to Coolidge, which is 120 miles north of the Mexico border, because he felt that not enough barrier and border enhancements had been erected since Donald Trump became president 27 months previously. North Dakota's junior U.S. Senator, Republican Kevin Cramer, was there to promote his state's firm, Fisher Industries, which demonstrated its ability by constructing a 56-foot fence in Coolidge, located 120 miles north of the Mexican border. However, Arizona's junior U.S. Senator, Republican Martha McSally said that a barrier will not resolve the border crisis.\nIn late 2018, Kobach joined with other right-wing political operatives, including billionaire Erik Prince, Trump's chief political strategist and former Breitbart editor Steve Bannon, Breitbart manager Brandon Darby, former Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Sheriff David Clarke, former Congressman Tom Tancredo and social media \"fake news\" scion, Brian Kolfage, to form an organization to raise funds ostensibly to facilitate construction of a barrier. Kolfage, a prodigious Internet fundraiser associated with a long history of dubious schemes using Facebook and GoFundMe to collect both money and potential contacts for exploitation, had raised tens of millions of donated dollars and asserted the organization would raise such private funds to construct hundreds of miles of their proposed border wall on private lands in Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas. As its prime organizer, in December 2018, Kolfage launched what he represented as an attempt to raise $1 billion via GoFundMe for the wall's construction. Kolfage stated that the target figure was achievable, adding \"This won't be easy, but it's our duty as citizens\".\nIn December 2018, he emailed the \"Washington Post\", stating that he started the fundraiser because \"political games from both parties\" had held back funding for the proposed wall. Within three days, over $9 million had been raised. In January 2019, Kolfage posted a message to the GoFundMe page that he had decided raising money instead through a nonprofit would be more productive. His new 501(c)(4) nonprofit was called \"We Build The Wall Inc.\" through which he described his plans to have segments of the wall privately erected through negotiations with U.S. landowners along the border. GoFundMe however issued a statement after Kolfage's statement that it would give refunds unless the donor chose to opt into the change to where the donations would go. Kobach said that 94% of the donors agreed to have their contributions disbursed to the 501(c)4.\nBy January 2019, Kobach joined Kolfage's advisory board, saying he was currently unpaid, but might take a paid position with Kolfage's organization. Kobach indicated the most substantial problems along the border were \"litter and security.\" Regarding a phone call between him and the president on January 23, 2019, Kobach reported that Trump endorsed the project saying, \"...the project has my blessing, and you can tell the media that,\" though the White House had not independently confirmed that contention. In addition to Koflage's history, another basic problem with the scheme was that almost all the land on the border is in the hands of the federal government, border states, and Native American tribes. The small number of privately owned border parcels in proximity to the demarcation are widely dispersed, leaving few opportunities to allow for the construction of any connected barriers. That left open the question, for what purpose would all that money actually be used? As the money Kolfage was accumulating was going to a 501(c)4, it could all be spent as \"dark money\" in political campaigns, with next to no public reporting of expenditures required.\nIn early June, 2019, the Kolflage/Kobach group constructed an access gate on federal land under the jurisdiction of the United States element of the International Boundary and Water Commission (IBWC). That is the body that, partnered with Mexico, administers control of rivers along the border. The commission noted the gate impermissibly blocked a U.S. Government-owned levee road. \"We Build the Wall\" kept the gate closed, according to the commission, despite repeated requests to allow access. On June 10, the commission took the step of securing the gate open with a lock and chain in the daytime, only keeping it locked at night.\nOn August 20, 2020, a federal grand jury indictment was unsealed against We Build the Wall advisory board member Steve Bannon, Kolfage, and two others, charging them with conspiracy to commit wire fraud and money laundering. Each charge has a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison upon conviction. Federal prosecutors of the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York allege that Bannon, United States Air Force veteran Kolfage, and the two other defendants used funds received from the We Build the Wall fundraising campaign, marketed to support the building of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, in a way which was \"inconsistent\" with how they were advertised for use to the public. According to the indictment, donations were collected through a GoFundMe campaign that was launched in December 2018. Bannon promoted the project until the day before the indictment, saying \"You've been the leader of this, assisting President Trump in building this wall in these tough areas\" in his \"War Room: Pandemic\" podcast. On January 20, 2021, eight hours before he left office, Trump issued a pardon for Bannon.\nPolitical career.\nEarly political involvement.\nKobach won a seat on the Overland Park City Council, in April 1999. Following the September 11 attacks, Kobach helped construct a program that mandated that men from 24 predominantly Muslim countries and North Korea be fingerprinted, photographed and questioned at government offices. Of the 83,000 plus men who did so, the government moved to deport 13,740 of them for immigration violations.\nKobach ran for Kansas State Senate in 2000, finishing third out of four Republican primary candidates.\nIn the 2004 election cycle, Kobach was the Republican nominee for Congress in the 3rd District, narrowly besting primary opponent and 2002 party nominee Adam Taff by 207 votes, with state representative Patricia Lightner far behind. He lost to incumbent Dennis Moore, 55%\u201343%. The victory was the largest of Moore's congressional campaigns. The campaign thrust Kobach onto the national stage, mostly due to his stance on illegal immigration. Kobach advocated for the imposition of a national consumption (sales) tax. He was given a speaking role on the opening day of the 2004 Republican National Convention and used his slot to call for the U.S. military to be sent to the Mexican border to block illegal immigration.\nChairman of the Kansas Republican Party.\nOn January 28, 2007, Kobach was elected Chairman of the Kansas Republican Party (GOP), serving until January 2009. Kobach's chairmanship was noted for the broad changes he introduced to election efforts. As Chairman, he raised money for targeted statewide and legislative races and instituted a direct-role policy for the state party in those races. He also pushed the State Committee to create a \"loyalty committee\", which was charged with sanctioning Republicans who assisted Democratic candidates in contested races.\nThis led to several party officers being stripped of voting rights in party matters as punishment for giving campaign contributions to Democratic Candidates. After Kobach left office, a Federal Elections Commission (FEC) audit strongly criticized Kobach's financial management of the Kansas GOP. The FEC audit found that when Kobach served as chairman, the state party failed to pay state and federal taxes. It was also discovered that illegal contributions were accepted.\nIn December 2007, Kobach sent an email saying, \"[T]o date, the Kansas GOP has identified and caged more voters in the last 11 months than the previous two years.\"\nKansas Secretary of State.\nOn May 26, 2009, Kobach announced his candidacy for Kansas Secretary of State. His opponents in the Republican primary were Shawnee County Election Commissioner Elizabeth Ensley and J.R. Claeys, former president of the National Association of Government Contractors. Kobach won the Republican nomination with 50.6% of the vote. Ensley and Claeys finished with 27.0% and 22.4%, respectively.\nOn November 2, 2010, Kobach defeated incumbent Democrat Chris Biggs, 59%\u201337%. Kobach was endorsed by Tennessee's former U.S. Senator Fred Thompson, as well as former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft (his former boss at the Dept. of Justice). Joe Arpaio, Arizona's controversial then-Sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, campaigned for Kobach as well.\nAlthough Kobach's campaign treasurer, Tom Arpke, possessed campaign experience, losing a state senate race in 2008, winning a Salina City Council seat the next year, and a state House seat in 2010, he was found to have under-reported contributions by $35,000 and nearly $43,000 in expenditures in Kobach's 2010 campaign, resulting in a maximum $5,000 fine. Kobach complained that he was being discriminated against because former Republican Governor Bill Graves received a much smaller fine for similar violations. Kobach alleged, \"The only real distinction I can see is that I'm a conservative and he's a moderate.\" The chair of the Kansas Ethics Commission said \"The commission does not condone lack of candor before the commission.\" Commission members questioned Arpke's honesty, a recurrent theme in his subsequent career. When he obtained convictions of Kansans for interstate voting irregularities in 2016, Kobach said, \"The fines are \"exactly what I wanted to see in cases like this when I made the case before Kansas Legislature that this authority was needed ... A $5,000 fine is very significant, and hopefully something no one would want to have to pay\", he said.\nThe 2012 Republican Party platform included self-deportation as a response to illegal immigration to the United States. Kobach proposed the measure, stating \"If you really want to create a job tomorrow, you can remove an illegal alien today.\"\nIn 2013, the League of Women Voters joined a challenge to Kobach's \"proof of citizenship\" requirements for Kansas Voters.\nIn response to a caller on his March 1, 2015 radio show, Kobach agreed that it would not be \"a huge jump\" for the Obama administration to call for an end to the prosecution of all African-American suspects. The Kansas Democratic Party decried Kobach's comment as \"hate speech\" and termed it \"a new low.\" Wichita's Oletha Faust-Goudeau, the only African-American woman in the Kansas Senate, called Kobach's comments ridiculous. Kobach said that he stood by his allegations declaring, \"My point was to bring attention to the Obama Justice Department's position that some civil rights statutes can't be enforced against people of color\", Kobach said. \"For example, one of the Obama administration's first actions it took in 2009 was to drop the slam-dunk charges against the New Black Panther Party for voter intimidation.\" One Republican member of the Civil Rights Commission disagreed, however. Abigail Thernstrom, writing in \"National Review\", described the incident as \"small potatoes\". She warned that exaggerating its importance could hurt conservatives, noting that in 45 years there had only been three successful prosecutions. She said only two \"Panthers,\" one of whom displayed a billy club, had been at a single, majority-black precinct in Philadelphia. After months of hearings, testimony, and investigation, no actual evidence was found that any voters were afraid to vote. She continued, \"Too much overheated rhetoric filled with insinuations and unsubstantiated charges has been devoted to this case.\"\nOn September 2, 2015, representatives of groups most likely to be affected by Kobach's plan to shorten a deadline for tens of thousands of suspended voters to produce proof of citizenship, including the ACLU, the League of Women Voters (LWV), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the National Organization for Women (NOW), all testified in a Topeka hearing conducted by Brian Caskey, a Kobach appointee, against the implementation of Kobach's policy. Although Kobach's office was in the building adjacent to the courthouse, he failed to appear for the rule change hearing and to answer questions. Instead, his request was supported by Andrew Howell, a Shawnee county elections official whom Kobach also had appointed.\nIn response to criticism levied by the campaign staff of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Kobach characterized them as \"left-wing knuckleheads\". He remarked that Clinton was getting her \"pant suit in a twist\", over his stance in favor of implementing some of the most strictly enforced voter ID laws in the United States. Clinton had claimed Kobach's interventions were an attempt to make voting more difficult for key Democratic constituencies, such as young people and racial minorities.\nIn October 2015, Kobach spoke at a conference organized by Social Contract Press, an organization that the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has designated as a hate group.\nWhile speaking on February 20, 2016, to a committee of the Kansas 2nd Congressional District delegates, regarding their challenges of the proof-of-citizenship voting law he championed in 2011, Kobach said: \"The ACLU and their fellow communist friends, the League of Women Voters \u2014 you can quote me on that, sued\".\nIn February 2016, Kobach endorsed Donald Trump's campaign for the U.S. Presidency, citing his stance on immigration. He proposed a halt to what he said was $23 billion in annual remittances by Mexican nationals illegally living in the U.S. unless Mexico makes a one-time $5\u201310 billion payment for Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.\nOn August 1, 2018, Kobach's office was ordered by federal judge Julie A. Robinson to pay $26,000 in attorney fees to the Kansas American Civil Liberties Union for court costs in a proof-of-citizenship case which he lost.\nElection ruling in 2014 U.S. Senate race.\nIn September 2014, Democrat Chad Taylor announced he was withdrawing from that year's U.S. Senate race in Kansas. Kobach ruled that he had improperly filed his withdrawal, and his name had to remain on the ballot. Taylor claimed to have followed the instructions of Assistant Secretary of State Brad Bryant on his filing, which was completed within the appropriate time frame. Citing concurrence from Attorney General Derek Schmidt, Kobach's move was cheered by the Kansas Republican Party. Both Kobach and Schmidt were members of Republican U.S. Senator Pat Roberts' honorary campaign committee. Taylor's attempt to withdraw left the race more open for independent Greg Orman, strengthening his challenge to Sen. Roberts.\nOn September 18, 2014, the Kansas Supreme Court ruled that Taylor's withdrawal was proper and that Kobach had to remove Taylor's name from the ballot.\nOn October 1, 2014, a panel of three Shawnee County judges ruled that the Kansas Democratic Party was not required by state law to fill the vacancy on the ballot; Kobach ordered the ballots to be printed the next day. Kobach was re-elected in November 2014 over moderate former Republican State Senator and Democratic candidate Jean Kurtis Schodorf by a margin of nearly 19%.\nKansas Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act.\nIn 2009, records indicated that just seven allegations of voter fraud had been referred for investigation and possible prosecution, and just a single one had been prosecuted since 2004. In 2008, a similar bill was vetoed by then-Governor Kathleen Sebelius, a Democrat.\nHowever, on April 18, 2011, Governor Brownback signed Kobach's voter ID \"SAFE\" Act. Its core provisions are as follows:\nTravel issues.\nUnder Governor Sam Brownback, who left office on January 31, 2018, Kansas endured major fiscal deficits that affected highway funding and school transportation funding. In an effort to critically examine government expenditures, the Associated Press (AP) examined records of all flights taken by top government officials (regardless of which state agency paid for the trip) taken within the 15-month period from January 2015 to March 24, 2016. The Governor of Kansas is required to reimburse the state for personal or political travel, but the AP discovered that Kobach had not reimbursed the state for flights totaling more than 4,350 miles in the state Highway Patrol (KHP) nine-passenger, Raytheon King Air 350. A number of Kobach's trips aboard the state plane seemed to provide no apparent benefits to Kansans, nor were they undertaken in pursuit of official duties. Kobach is alleged to have scheduled negligible state business to coincide with Republican Party functions, taking his family along with him.\nIn August, he and two of his daughters made a $360 flight to Newton to meet the county clerk before attending the county Republican Ice Cream Social. Two days later he flew to Wichita, at a cost of $524, to be the keynote speaker at the Sedgwick County Republican Party fundraising picnic. He spoke there about Republican party partisan issues.\nHe was unable to reserve the Beechcraft to fly to Washington, D.C., for a hearing and deposition on a lawsuit which he had joined in support of Brian Newby, whom he had helped get appointed as the federal Election Assistance Commission (EAC) director. Newby had previously been appointed by Kobach as a Kansas elections official. Kobach and a staff member's commercial flights and other expenses cost $6,594. Newby, without public notice, unilaterally changed a national voter registration form in order to require residents of Kansas, Georgia and Alabama to show proof of citizenship. Representative Jim Ward criticized Kobach's use of the state plane to promote national voter ID policies, an action he contended was intended to \"suppress votes.\" State Senate Democratic Minority Leader Anthony Hensley said Kobach should reimburse Kansas for trips to Republican Party events, characterizing claims that the political functions coincided with official business was \"probably just a ruse.\"\nVoter fraud claims.\nAs Secretary of State of Kansas, Kobach has implemented some of the strictest voter ID laws in the United States. In September 2016 it was reported he \"agreed last month to add nearly 20,000 properly registered voters to the state's rolls only after being threatened with contempt of court.\" In response to a sufficient citizens petition that, as somewhat uniquely allowed in Kansas, requesting the convening of a grand jury for the purpose of investigating Kobach's actions, the state Court of Appeals ruled against him. He complained to the Kansas Supreme Court that Derek Schmidt, the Kansas Attorney General, who had withdrawn from the case, failed to properly represent him in the Appeals court. In deciding the merits, the state Supreme Court ruled on August 31, 2018 that a grand jury to investigate the matter must be convened in Douglas County, where he resided. The Brennan Center for Justice described him as \"a key architect behind many of the nation's anti-voter and anti-immigration policies.\" Kobach has periodically made unsubstantiated claims about the extent of voter fraud in the United States.\nIn a 2010 press conference, Kobach asserted there could be as many as 2,000 people who were using the identities of dead people to vote in Kansas, mentioning it \"certainly seems like a very real possibility\" that \"Albert K. Brewer\" was an example of one such deceased individual who had voted in a recent primary. When \"The Wichita Eagle\" followed up on Kobach's assertion, it discovered Brewer, 78 years old, was still alive, although his father, who was born in 1904 and had a different middle initial, had died in 1996. Brewer told the Eagle reporter, \"I don't think this is heaven, not when I'm raking leaves.\"\nKobach has also said that there are 18,000 non-citizens registered to vote in Kansas, a claim that \"NBC News\" described as \"misleading\" and \"debunked\".\nKobach supported Trump's claims that millions of non-citizens voted in the 2016 presidential election. Kobach estimated that 3.2 million non-citizens voted, citing a widely debunked study. Kobach complained that, during one of his appearances, CNN ran text on the screen saying Kobach's claims that millions illegally voted in the 2016 election were \"false\". CNN also asked him if he had any proof of his allegation that thousands of Massachusetts voters actually had voted in New Hampshire in 2016. He replied that he had none.\nIn September 2017, Kobach claimed to have proof that voter fraud swung the 2016 Senate race in New Hampshire and may have swung New Hampshire's 2016 presidential vote; fact-checkers and election experts found that Kobach's assertion was false. Kobach claimed that more than 5,000 individuals voted by using out-of-state driving licenses as identification, even though New Hampshire residents are required to update their licenses in order to drive. However, New Hampshire state law allows residents of the state who happen to have out-of-state driving licenses to vote. There are a number of reasons why some voters may use out-of-state driving licenses, with the most likely being that they are out-of-state college students. Numerous legitimate New Hampshire voters said that this was the case with them; they were students at colleges in New Hampshire who had yet to update their driving license. New Hampshire Public Radio also found that most instances of out-of-state driving licenses being used were in college towns. Another reason is that they may be military personnel on active duty. \"FactCheck.Org\" described Kobach's claim as \"baseless\" and \"bogus\", noting that Kobach \"hasn't provided evidence of any illegal voting\". Later that September, Kobach backtracked on his claims, but said that there have been \"anecdotal reports\" about voter fraud.\nRichard L. Hasen, the Chancellor's Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of California, Irvine, an election law expert, has described Kobach as a \"charlatan\", \"provocateur\" and \"a leader nationally in making irresponsible claims that voter fraud is a major problem in this country.\"\nProsecutions of voter fraud.\nIn 2015, Kobach received from the legislature and the governor the right to prosecute cases of voter fraud, after claiming for four years that Kansas had a massive problem of voter fraud that the local and state prosecutors were not adequately addressing. At that time, he \"said he had identified more than 100 possible cases of double voting.\" Testifying during hearings on the bill, questioned by Rep. John Carmichael, Kobach was unable to cite a single other state that gives its Secretary of State such authority. By February 7, 2017, Kobach had filed nine cases and obtained six convictions. All were regarding cases of double voting; none would have been prevented by voter ID laws. One case was dropped. The other two were still pending. All six convictions involved older citizens, including four white Republican men and one woman, who were unaware that they had done anything wrong.\nOne of those Kansans prosecuted, Randall Kilian, thought he was expressing his preference about marijuana legalization as it affected his new Colorado retirement property after receiving a mail-in ballot in 2012, when he was 59 years old. He did not want pot growing next to his home, so he marked that issue only, and mailed it in as instructed. The sheriff and county attorney of Ellis County, Kansas, learned of this and questioned Kilian. Both concluded he had not intentionally broken the law and decided not to prosecute. However, when Kobach got prosecutorial authority in such cases, a year later, he reopened the case. Trying to avoid the expense of a trial, Kilian pleaded guilty in 2016 and paid a $2,500 fine.\nCritics of Kobach, including the Southern Poverty Law Center, claim he overreaches on cases that district attorneys deemed not worth prosecuting, and allege that he is motivated by racism. In his 2020 U.S. Senate campaign, Kobach hired a white supremacist who had also backed his 2018 gubernatorial campaign. In 2017, while vetting Kobach as a potential appointee for the administration of Donald Trump, the Republican National Committee raised \"White Supremacy\" as a possible problem affecting such an action.\nKobach examined 84 million votes that were cast in 22 states, but referred only 14 cases to be prosecuted. University of Kansas assistant professor of political science Patrick Miller includes voter intimidation as a form of fraud. \"The substantially bigger issue with voter fraud has been election fraud being perpetrated by election officials and party officials tampering with votes ... It is not the rampant problem that the public believes that is there. Kris Kobach says it is. Donald Trump says it is. And the data just aren't there to prove it. It's a popular misconception that this is a massive problem.\"\nA Brennan Center for Justice report calculated that rates of actual voter fraud are between 0.00004 percent and 0.0009 percent. The Center calculated that someone is more likely to be struck by lightning than to commit voter fraud.\nCrosscheck.\nIn his role as Kansas Secretary of State, Kobach directed the Interstate Voter Registration Crosscheck Program, which compared state records to find people possibly registered to vote in more than one place. The program had been launched in 2005 by a predecessor of Kobach, Republican Ron Thornburgh. From 2011 until the program's temporary suspension in early 2018, Kobach oversaw its rapid expansion to 30 states.\nThe program was dogged with accusations of voter suppression enabled by its primitive data matching. According to the \"New York Times,\" \"The program searches for double registrations using only voters' first and last names and date of birth, and it generates thousands of false matches\u2014John Smith in Kansas can easily be confused with John Smith in Iowa.\" Due to its tendency to produce false matches, the program could be implemented to suppress the vote and wrongly remove legitimate voters from voter rolls.\nThe large numbers of false positives produced by the program led to sensational and misleading headlines: for example, 35,750 voters in the 2012 North Carolina general election matched with voters with supposedly identical voters in other states, but upon close investigation only \"eight cases of potential double voting were referred to prosecutors and two people were convicted.\" A 2016 paper by researchers at Stanford, Harvard, Yale and the University of Pennsylvania found that if the program were fully implemented \"200 legitimate voters may be impeded from voting for every double vote stopped.\" By 2017, doubts over the accuracy of Crosscheck had led four states to withdraw from the program.\nIn 2017, researchers revealed that Crosscheck's massive database was poorly secured. Tech reporter Dell Cameron wrote in Gizmodo \"It would be difficult to overstate Crosscheck's carelessness when it comes to handling voter records\". Fourteen national security experts wrote an amicus brief asserting that \"large-scale databases containing personal information are particularly attractive targets for malicious cyber actors\" to argue against Kobach building a second, similar database. As Crosscheck member states grew concerned over the safety of their voter data, Kobach suspended the program temporarily in early 2018.\nThe program's suspension became federally mandated upon the settlement of Moore v Kobach (later referred to as Moore v Schwab) in December 2019 which accused the Crosscheck program of violating voters' privacy rights through their careless handling of voter data.\nKobach's data leaks.\nThe technology website Gizmodo discovered that Kobach's office had made the last four digits of the Social Security (SS) numbers of thousands of state employees and legislators available to anyone doing an Internet search. It informed Kobach's office of the problem and was informed it would be remedied. Gizmodo analyzed conflict of interest forms filed by the current 125 state House members, and those of 40 senators, and found the partial SS numbers for 117 of the Kansas House members, and those of 34 senators, as well as the numbers of former legislators. In a separate instance, the state of Florida, which had received Social Security numbers of hundreds of Kansas voters from Kobach in 2013 via participation in the Crosscheck program, made them publicly available in 2017 leading to the federally mandated suspension of the program after a lawsuit accused Kobach of violating voters' privacy rights.\nProof of citizenship requirement laws.\nFrom 2013\u20132015, more than 36,000 Kansas residents (14% of those trying to register to vote) were placed on a suspense list because they failed to meet the proof of citizenship requirements that had been introduced in a 2013 law. Kobach justified the law, saying that it stopped what he described as the rampant problem of non-citizens voting; \"Reuters\" noted that \"there is little evidence\" of non-citizen voting being a problem. A federal judge ordered Kobach to register more than 18,000 voters kept off the rolls by the proof of citizenship law; in her ruling, she wrote, \"The court cannot find that the state's interest in preventing non-citizens from voting in Kansas outweighs the risk of disenfranchising thousands of qualified voters\". The judge noted that there was only evidence of three non-citizens in Kansas voting between 2003 and 2013.\nA \"Reuters\" analysis of the individuals on a suspense list found that \"more than 60 percent were age 25 or under. They were clustered in the high-population areas of Wichita, Topeka and the Kansas City suburbs, and the college towns of Lawrence and Manhattan.\" 41 percent were unaffiliated, 35 percent registered as Democrats and 23 percent as Republicans. \"Reuters\" noted that the proof of citizenship requirement \"has created a chaotic two-tier system where some Kansans can vote in state elections and some cannot, some need to provide proof of citizenship and others do not, and many county election officials are uncertain how to proceed.\"\nAn appellate case, No. 16-5196, requesting an injunction by the federal courts to prevent the implementation of revised voter registrations in Kansas, Georgia and Alabama, was argued on September 8, 2016, and decided in favor of the appellants on September 26, 2016. The relief was granted by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. It prevented the use of the revised forms. The case was the League of Women Voters of the United States, et al., versus Brian Newby, in his capacity as the Executive Director of the United States Election Assistance Commission. On June 18, 2018, a federal judge ruled that proof of citizenship voting requirements were unconstitutional, and ordered Kobach to take six hours of legal education before he could renew his law license.\n\"Fish v. Kobach\" trial.\nOn February 18, 2016, the American Civil Liberties Union filed suit against Kobach and Kansas Secretary of Revenue Nick Jordan on behalf of Steven Wayne Fish and others alleging that the Documentary Proof of Citizenship requirement of the Kansas Secure and Fair Elections (SAFE) Act violated the National Voter Registration (Motor Voter) Act of 1993. A temporary injunction was issued on May 17, which was upheld by the appellate court in Denver on October 19. On June 23, 2017, Kobach was fined $1,000 for \"deliberately attempting to mislead the court\" on whether he was complying with the court orders in this case.\nIn April 2018, Kobach was found to be in contempt of court for failing to follow an order by a federal judge to notify the approximately 18,000 voters whose voting registration was being held up by Kobach that they were fully registered and could vote. Kobach had at the time of the order assured the judge that he would notify these voters via postcard. More than 18 months later, the ACLU noted to the judge that Kobach had yet to do so. Trial hearings had run from March 6 to 19, 2018, with a contempt hearing for Mr. Kobach on March 20.\nOn April 18, 2018, Julie A. Robinson the Chief Judge of the U.S. District Court of Kansas, officially ruled that Kobach was in contempt. He was not fined but was ordered to pay court costs, including more than $26,000 in attorney fees for the American Civil Liberties Union, which sought the contempt ruling and that \"any further remedial measures\" would be taken upon her ruling on the case. Moriah Day, a spokeswoman for Kobach's campaign for governor, said the secretary of state's office would appeal the decision and would have no other comment. Governor Jeff Coyler, who was competing against Kobach for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, said Kobach should be required to personally pay those fees that had been awarded. The response of the Secretary's office was that Kobach is shielded from any such liability. Kobach did pay a $1,000 fine, per Judge Robinson's order, but he did so with a credit card belonging to a staff member who was detailed to Ukraine with the U.S. military. He accepted a diversion agreement the details of which remain confidential, in response to complaints made over his actions in the citizenship requirements case. In the agreement, he stipulated that he had failed to properly supervise attorneys and support staff.\nVoter identification laws.\nKobach traveled to Alaska both to testify in the legislature on behalf of photo I.D. laws and to recruit its participation as another state in his \"Kansas Project.\" Opposing the change, representatives of indigenous Alaskan Natives said a photo I.D. rule would impede voting in remote, roadless, Native majority areas, referred to as \"the bush.\" Republican Lt. Governor Treadwell declined to support the bill, however, despite Kobach's claim that it was Treadwell who recruited him to push for its passage.\nTreadwell's opposition was based on concerns that the legislation in question would suppress voting in that demographic due to inherent difficulties for remote village residents in obtaining such identification, for whom getting driver's licenses can be burdensome and which are not mandated to have photos. Treadwell said he had no recollection of ever talking to Kobach directly about it although the subject had arisen in a roundtable discussion with NASS convention attendees. Responding to a reporter, he claimed he was unaware that Kobach had testified in his state, firmly rebutting the notion that he had any role in advancing the bill. The reporter, Richard Mauer,validated that Treadwell had not taken any position on it in testimony nor had he supported it via correspondence.\nOn October 31, 2018, 6 days before the gubernatorial general election, Kobach appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper and Jeffrey Toobin. After Cooper mentioned Kobach's efforts to require proof of U.S. citizenship while voting being struck down by a federal judge and leading to Kobach being ordered to attend a legal class, Toobin accused Kobach of having racially motivated intentions with the law, stating Kobach \"has devoted his career to stopping black people and poor people from voting,\" leading to a visibly offended Kobach calling Toobin's charge \"an outrageous accusation,\" to which Toobin responded \"Well, it's completely true.\" Kobach accused Toobin of displaying unsubstantiated claims, stating that \"the vast majority of African-Americans approve of photo ID.\" Toobin called Kobach's voter suppression committee \"a preposterous joke\" stating that the commission was disbanded because it could not prove high rates of voter fraud in the United States. Toobin accused Kobach of supporting electoral fraud, stating that Kobach's problem was \"that some people vote for Democrats, and you want to stop that by establishing voter requirements.\" Cooper then turned the conversation to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy. The conflict received heavy media attention, and HuffPost stated that Kobach \"has cultivated a reputation for voter suppression.\"\nDiscarding of provisional ballots.\nIn January 2017, Kansas election officials tossed thousands of uncounted provisional ballots cast in November 2016, saying that there was no record that those residents were registered voters. Kobach's office did not compile a count of how many ballots were tossed, but an assessment by the \"Associated Press\" and the League of Women Voters of the state's 11 largest counties out of a total of 105 counties, show that at least 8,864 ballots cast were discarded without being counted, slightly more than 1 percent of total votes in those counties.\nCommission on Election Integrity.\nTrump issued executive order establishing the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity on May 11, 2017. White House officials reported that Kobach would be serving as vice-chairman (with Vice President Pence as chairman) of the twelve-member, Republican majority commission, which will \"review claims of improper registrations and voting, fraudulent registrations and voter suppression\".\nAlthough Pence was the titular head of the Commission on Voter Integrity, Kobach was its operational leader. In that capacity, Kobach, who serves on the elections committee of the National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), wrote to the top election official in every state requesting they turn over voter data ostensibly to aid a countrywide search for evidence of election irregularities. Besides information such as the names and party affiliations of all registered voters, Kobach sought birth dates, felony conviction records, voting histories for the past decade and the last four digits of all voters' Social Security numbers. This precipitated a resounding bipartisan rejection of his inquiries with 22 states quickly rejecting his requests. Ironically, Indiana's Secretary of State, Connie Lawson, and even Kobach himself, indicated that their state laws forbade them from complying.\nKentucky's Secretary of State, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes, said the supposed basis for creation of the commission in the first place\u00a0\u2014 that voter fraud was pervasive and needed to be restrained\u00a0\u2014 was essentially a pretext. She continued, \"Kentucky will not aid a commission that is at best a waste of taxpayer money and at worst an effort to legitimize voter suppression efforts across the country\". Mississippi's Republican Secretary of State, Delbert Hosemann, said, \"They can go jump in the Gulf of Mexico, and Mississippi is a great state to launch from ... Mississippi residents should celebrate Independence Day and our state's right to protect the privacy of our citizens by conducting our own electoral processes.\"\nThe ACLU, representing plaintiffs in a voting rights case, asked the presiding federal judge to prevent Kobach from withholding the public documents he was photographed carrying as he met with Trump, by virtue of marking them \"confidential\". The plaintiffs demanded the public release of those documents they have received, that had been prepared with state funds. They claimed Kobach \"made statements to the public, the Court, and the President, suggesting that noncitizen registration fraud is a serious, widespread problem\", at the same time he tried to hide those same documents that debunked his claim, to prevent having to testify himself in open court about those same materials.\nIn June 2017, a federal magistrate judge, James O'Hara, found that Kobach had made \"patently misleading representations\" to the court when he claimed he didn't possess the materials sought by the plaintiffs, in the course of the document dispute. Kobach had been photographed with the president with the documents under his arm, and much of the cover page was readable in that photograph. In light of Kobach's \"deceptive conduct and lack of candor\", he was fined $1,000 by the court and ordered to submit to questioning by the ACLU about the documents.\nA student at Topeka's Washburn University took note of the magistrate judge's action and filed a complaint with the Disciplinary board of the Kansas Supreme Court, alleging that by his conduct, Kobach had \"shown a lack of respect for the courts.\" She informed the local press that the board had notified her by mail that it was investigating her complaint.\nOn July 3, 2017, a complaint was filed with the United States Department of Justice by Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a progressive activist group, to investigate whether Kobach violated the Hatch Act, accusing him of using his position as a federal employee, vice chairman of the Commission, to promote his current campaign for governor of Kansas, and to solicit campaign contributions.\nNon-profit organizations are plaintiffs in different lawsuits including the ACLU (\"ACLU v. Trump and Pence\" and \"Joyner v. Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity\") and the NAACP (\"NAACP v. Trump\"), contesting practices engaged in by the Commission. They include the American Civil Liberties Union, the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, the NAACP, Public Citizen, and the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC). The lawsuits by the first two groups involve the lack of transparency of the Commission's meetings, whereas the lawsuits by the second two groups involve the collection by the Commission of personal private data.\nOn July 24, United States District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly denied EPIC's request for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and preliminary injunction against the Commission, ruling that the Commission was not required to conduct a privacy review before gathering data. On August 29, the government's attorney told the judge that \"confusion\" at the Department of Justice had resulted in the failure to disclose relevant documents to the plaintiffs, and Kollar-Kotelly ordered the defendants to provide a \"Vaughn Index\" listing those documents they wanted to withhold in whole or part, and how it would comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act.\nIn January 2018, in the \"Joyner\" case the Department of Justice disclosed that the White House would not be turning over any state voter data to the Department of Homeland Security, despite the White House's and Kobach's earlier statements to the contrary.\nFellow Commission member Hans Von Spakovsky described the efforts of his Heritage Foundation colleague, Kobach, to expose the alleged existence of extensive voter fraud as, \"carefully described research\". An email sent by Von Spakovsky, the director of the Foundation's Election Law Reform Initiative, on Foundation letterhead, surfaced in September 2017, in which he had also urged United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions to block any Democrats and \"moderate Republicans and/or academics,\" from being appointed to the Commission.\nThe commission was disbanded by the Trump administration on January 3, 2018 without issuing a report. Richard L. Hasen, an election law expert, described its chairman as \"a leader nationally in making irresponsible claims that voter fraud is a major problem in this country.\"\n2018 Kansas gubernatorial primary.\nOn June 8, 2017, Kobach formally announced his campaign for Governor of Kansas in the 2018 election. In 2017, he was appointed the Vice Chairman and \"driving force\" behind Trump's Commission on Election Integrity, which purported to quantify the extent of voter fraud in the United States, but which critics said was intended to disenfranchise or deter legal voters. The Trump administration dissolved the commission on January 3, 2018.\nDuring this campaign for Governor, Kobach repeatedly used a slogan asserting that Kansas was the \"sanctuary state of the Midwest.\" The Associated Press noted that Kobach's slogan was \"false for several reasons, including the state's laws, compliance with federal immigration authorities and the undocumented immigrant population. Kansas has not passed any laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, unlike another Midwest state, Illinois.\" Kobach did not identify any sanctuary cities in Kansas when asked by the Associated Press.\nOn August 7, 2018, Kobach defeated incumbent Governor Jeff Colyer in the Republican gubernatorial primary in a tight vote. Kobach finished with a 343-vote margin.\n2018 Kansas gubernatorial general election.\nDemocratic state senator Laura Kelly easily won the Democratic nomination. In the general election, she defeated Republican primary winner Kobach and Independent Greg Orman, who had finished second in the 2014 U.S. Senate race against incumbent Republican Pat Roberts.\nKelly had benefited from Republican defections. On September 13, 2018, three prominent Republicans endorsed Kelly: Former Governor Bill Graves, former U.S. Senator Sheila Frahm, and former Kansas Senate President Dick Bond. On September 18, they were joined by former U.S. Senator and Republican from Kansas, Nancy Kassebaum, the daughter of ex-Governor Alf Landon, the 1936 Republican presidential nominee. She said: \"I'm a Republican, but that doesn't mean you walk lock step always with the party.\" \"...Kobach has developed a record that shows a focus on ways and how to accomplish his end goals that I think are not the best for Kansas.\" Regarding Kelly, Kassebaum said, \"...her experience, 18 years in the Kansas Legislature..., has given her a real understanding of what it takes to work across the aisle.\" On October 19, Governor Mike Hayden, a Republican who served from 1987 through 1991, also joined Kelly's endorsers who included former Governors Mark Parkinson, a Republican who became a Democrat, Democrats Kathleen Sebelius and John Carlin. Every living former governor of Kansas had endorsed Kelly, except Sam Brownback. Hayden said, \"This is a critical year for the state of Kansas. No one can sit on the sidelines in this election.\" Hayden continued, \"I've been a registered Republican for over 50 years. I seldom vote for Democratic candidates, but in this race, I strongly support Laura Kelly.\" Hayden said that, \"after much thought and analyzing,\" he felt that Orman could not win the governor's race. Former state senator Tim Owens, was the campaign treasurer for independent candidate Orman, but he stepped down on October 30, 2018, then endorsed moderate democrat Laura Kelly in the race. State Senate President and former chair of the American Legislative Exchange Council Susan Wagle enthusiastically endorsed Kobach, though two years later she filed to run against him for the U.S. Senate seat of the retiring Pat Roberts. Wagle had said he was the \"strongest candidate,\" and, \"I ask my fellow Republicans to stand with the candidate who best reflects Kansas values.\"\nKobach received political contributions from US Immigration Reform Pac, a political action committee (PAC) which was headed by the widow of John Tanton (1934-2019), a white supremacist known for founding numerous exclusionary and \"English-Only\" groups that were the core of the modern American anti-immigrant movement. It previously gave him $4,000 in his congressional race in 2004, but raised that to $20,000 when he was running for governor. Other groups founded by Tanton included the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) where Kobach worked for ten years. Paul Nachman, whom the Southern Poverty Law Center identifies as a \"Montana-based extremist who frequently writes for VDARE, an openly racist blog that serves as a source for white nationalists and antisemites,\" was another donor. The Southern Poverty Law Center describes VDARE as \"an anti-immigration hate website\" which \"regularly publishes articles by prominent white nationalists, race scientists and anti-Semites\", including Steve Sailer, Jared Taylor, J. Philippe Rushton, Samuel T. Francis, and Pat Buchanan.\nState Objections Board.\nIn 2018, after allegations that appointed incumbent, Republican Representative Michael Capps, did not live as required in the electoral district in which he was running, a complaint was submitted by the Democratic party to the board. In 2018, Capps ran for the seat in House District 85, having given his residence address as 3103 North Governeour, Wichita, with a mailing address of 6505 East Central Ave #110. Capps had first filed to run for seat 97, but after Representative Chuck Weber resigned his District 85 seat, Capps said he lived at the Governeour street address, a home which had been scheduled to be sold at auction on June 27, 2018. Democrats complained it was not Capps' true address, but the state Objections Board, composed of Republicans Lieutenant Governor Tracey Mann, Attorney General Derek Schmidt and Kobach, refused to uphold the complaint and allowed Capps to stay on the ballot. Capps received 54% of the vote to 46% for Democrat Monica Marks. When a Wichita Eagle reporter went to the home in the wake of October 2019 accusations about a fabricated attack video made by Capps against Wichita mayoral runoff candidate Brandon Whipple, an unidentified young man living there said he was \"house sitting\" and hadn't seen Capps, \"in a while.\"\n2020 U.S. Senate election.\nIn 2019, Kobach announced he was running for the United States Senate seat being vacated by the retiring Pat Roberts. Roberts was opposed to his candidacy, however, as was the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC). Its officials privately informed Kansas Republicans that should Kobach enter the race, the NRSC would labor to assure he did not win the primary. Referring to the theme, he said, \"I\u2019ve been on the southern border constantly in the past six months and I can tell you stories that will make your skin crawl.\" A spokesperson confirmed Kobach had spoken to Trump about the announcement of his candidacy on July 4. \"I don\u2019t talk about what the president and I say in our communications, but let me just say he was very encouraging when we spoke a few days ago.\"\nKobach was credited with introducing the controversial tactic of adding a citizenship question to the 2020 census questionnaires, but it was thought his advocacy may have led to the Supreme Court ruling against the initiative, as the Trump administration informed the court that U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross had initiated the divisive proposal. Joanna Rodriguez, the NRSC press secretary, stated, \"Just last year Kris Kobach ran and lost to a Democrat. Now, he wants to do the same and simultaneously put President Trump\u2019s presidency and Senate Majority at risk. We know Kansans won\u2019t let that happen and we look forward to watching the Republican candidate they do choose win next fall.\" Kobach said he thought the NRSC had not taken such a position, responding to an inquiry, \"The race in the Kansas Senate is going to be about President Trump. It\u2019s certainly not going to endanger President Trump.\" Kobach's 2020 campaign employed Joe Suber, an Olathe, Kansas man who regularly makes posts to a white nationalist, Holocaust-denialist website, \"The Unz Review\". Suber had set up and became the registered agent for a limited liability corporation, 'Kobach for Senate.\"\nCampaign finance violation questions.\nKobach's involvement with the 501(c)4, \"We Build the Wall,\" (WBtW) has given cause for concern, as the fundraising and campaign mailing lists it is accumulating are prohibited from coordinating with his Senate campaign, but the ability and appetite for effective oversight within the Trump administration are anticipated to likely be inadequate. On August 1, 2019, Kobach sent out a campaign fundraiser using both the corporate name and email list of WBtW donors. Common Cause Vice President for policy and litigation Paul S. Ryan said, \"At a minimum, this Kobach for Senate fundraising solicitation email appears to violate the 'paid for by' disclaimer requirement\" for official campaign communications. Ryan specified the requirement that mandates disclosure of the financial sponsors who originate official political communications. Kobach's email might be legal if his campaign paid fair market value for the use of WBtW's list. If that were the case, a \"paid for by\" disclaimer would be required but was not present in the solicitation. Ryan said, \"If the Kobach committee did not pay fair market value for the cost of disseminating this email, then the Kobach committee has arguably committed the more serious campaign finance law violation of receiving a corporate contribution in the form of a coordinated expenditure.\" We Build The Wall is legally prohibited from financing federal political campaigns, in any fashion. Besides the concerns raised about Kolfage himself, a week prior to the mailer, right-wing anti-immigrant, WBtW board member and former congressman Tom Tancredo sat on the stage alongside Kobach and endorsed him in a New Mexico rally pushing the Wall. The Kobach campaign said after Common Cause filed a formal complaint and request for an investigation into the apparent violations, that it is a \"radical leftist organization\" that the complaint was without substance and, \"This attack by Common Cause also includes a frivolous letter to the Department of Justice, asking the Department of Justice to launch a pointless investigation. This is also typical of Common Cause tactics and it is intended to cause distraction wherever conservative Republicans are leading in important political campaigns.\"\nOn July 23, 2019, Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle of Wichita filed the paperwork with the Federal Elections Commission necessary to run. She criticized Kobach's employment in his controversial privately financed and constructed scheme to build the southern border wall. Wagle supports the building of a federally designed, bid, and funded wall while saying Kobach's group undermines federal involvement. \"We don't need some rogue organization going out and building the wall,\" she said. In July 2018, Wagle had supported Kobach in the gubernatorial primary, saying, \"I am proud to endorse Kris Kobach.\" The endorsement was unlawfully sent out by Wagle's staff spokeswoman on a state computer, thus violating Kansas ethics rules.\nPrimary debate.\nIn a live-streamed debate on May 22, 2020, in a ballroom devoid of spectators due to the COVID-19 pandemic, all candidates praised president Donald Trump. Kobach took on his opponents who all agreed that he could not not win the general election against presumptive Democratic nominee, Barbara Bollier. They were Wagle, former Kansas City Chiefs defensive end Dave Lindstrom, wealthy businessman Bob Hamilton, and incumbent congressman Roger Marshall. Marshall said, \"We cannot afford to send a failed candidate back this fall who will lose to Barbara Bollier and hand the Senate majority over to Chuck Schumer.\" \"Instead, we need to send a tried and trusted friend of President Trump.\" Referring to Marshall, Kobach replied, \"Do you want a go-along-to-get-along kind of senator, a gutless wonder who never takes a stand, or, do you want someone who poses a threat?\" Hamilton said voters didn't have to choose between Kobach, who couldn't win, and a moderate Marshall, in whose behest the state party leaders had urged Senator Wagle and Lindstrom, to drop out of the race. Objecting to the party pressure, Lindstrom characterized his opponents as \"shortsighted, self-serving...career politicians who are divisive, controversial,\" and, \"have a record of losing elections.\" Wagle touted her own candidacy, saying, \"It\u2019s very, very important that we send a leader to the U.S. Senate who is articulate, who is persuasive, who other people respect.\" \"I'm the one who's already debated Barbara Bollier.\" \"I win on the Senate floor. I've beat (sic) her numerous times,\" \"...the conservative voice that can beat that liberal voice in the U.S. Senate.\" In response to a claim that Marshall would not prioritize agriculture, Marshall said, \"Fake news and another lie by Kris Kobach.\"\nConnections with Trump administration.\nKobach was a member of the Platform Committee of the 2016 Republican National Convention. It was subsequently reported that Kobach was being considered for Secretary of Homeland Security. He was photographed carrying a document into a meeting with Trump the title of which could be read as being, \"Department of Homeland Security, Kobach Strategic Plan for First 365 Days\". This plan reportedly included a register of Muslims as part of a suite of proposals, which included the \"extreme vetting\" of immigrants. \"The New York Times\" described Kobach as \"close to the White House inner circle, including the president and his chief strategist, Steve Bannon\",; also published by the \"New York Times\" on June 18, 2017, on Page MM26 of the Sunday Magazine with the headline: \"The Exclusionist\"&lt;/ref&gt; and having told the Associated Press that he met Trump in May 2017 through his son Donald Trump Jr., \"with whom he has a mutual friend\". He was named vice chairman of the new Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity by Trump in 2017. In June 2017 he told supporters that he has had \"the honor of personally advising President Trump, both before the election and after the election, on how to reduce illegal immigration.\"\nIn a March 14, 2019 hearing, Commerce Department Secretary Wilbur Ross was questioned about his conversations regarding the adding of a citizenship question to the 2020 census surveys, which he had with immigration hardliners Kobach, Bannon, and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Missouri Democratic Representative Lacy Clay accused Ross of being \"complicit\" regarding his efforts to weaken minority group voting rights, accusing Ross of committing perjury. He called for Ross to tender his resignation, saying, \"You lied to Congress. You misled the American people and you are complicit in the Trump administration's intent to suppress the growing political power of the non-white population.\" The United States Supreme Court heard arguments on April 23, 2019, regarding appeals of rejections by three circuit courts of the proposed inclusion of the survey question. The court affirmed the appeals, rejecting the question's inclusion, and it was felt Kobach's initial advocacy of the initiative undermined the rationale of the Census Bureau's case.\nWhen asked by ABC News about Trump's claim that he (Trump) had \"won the\u00a0popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,\" Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway gave Kobach as a source of the claim. Kobach later told reporters in Kansas that, \"I think the president-elect is absolutely correct when he says the number of illegal votes cast exceeds the popular-vote margin between him and Hillary Clinton,\" pointing to a 2014 study led by Jesse Richman, that claimed that \"6.4 percent of noncitizens voted in 2008\". However, Richman's results, when reviewed by other researchers, were thoroughly rejected. Richman claimed to have found 489 noncitizens within a Harvard survey of 55,400 American adults, called the Cooperative Congressional Election Study. Two years later, three coordinators of the original C.C.E.S. study went back and re-interviewed 19,000 of the respondents, finding only 85 who said they were noncitizens and not one could be matched to a valid voting record. \"Thus the best estimate of the percentage of noncitizens who vote is zero\", the researchers wrote.\nIn late March 2019, the Associated Press reported that President Donald Trump was considering creating a post of \"immigration czar\" to coordinate efforts among federal agencies involved in the issues, with Kobach being one of two top candidates for the job.\nIn the spring of 2019, Kobach presented a 10-point list of conditions that would have to be fulfilled for him to become Trump's \"immigration czar.\" The list included: A West Wing office; \u201cwalk in\u201d access to the Oval Office; 24-hour access to a government jet so he could fly to the border on a moment's notice and travel back to Kansas on weekends; an assurance that he would be made Secretary of Homeland Security by November 2019; a guarantee that he would be the administration's primary spokesman on immigration policy; a guarantee that other Cabinet secretaries whose positions relate to immigration would defer to him, with Trump mediating disputes as needed; a seven-person staff; a security detail if necessary; and the title of assistant to the president. Some Trump administration officials were shocked by Kobach's presumptuousness. The position would not require Senate confirmation; Trump, however, was certain Kobach would have difficulty winning Senate confirmation for the position.\nAfter Joe Biden won the 2020 presidential election and Donald Trump refused to concede, Kobach led a group which sought to aid Trump in his efforts to overturn the election results.\nPolitical positions.\nKobach initially came to prominence in U.S. politics over his hardline views on immigration, which lead to accusations against him of white supremacy, and his involvement in the implementation of high-profile anti-immigration ordinances in various American towns.\nIn October 2017, Kobach wrote a column in Breitbart News which said that immigrants commit a disproportionate share of crimes, and that the United States should limit the amount of immigrants admitted on a yearly basis. According to \"The Kansas City Star,\" the claims made in the article have \"been debunked by numerous studies over multiple years. In fact, studies have found immigrants are\u00a0\"less\"\u00a0likely to commit crimes than people born in the U.S.\" To support his claims, Kobach cited a column by Peter Gemma, who is associated with white supremacist groups and the American Holocaust denial movement.\nKobach identifies himself as a supporter the rights of gun owners including extending concealed carry rights down from age 21 to age 18, and believes school teachers, coaches, and staff should be allowed to carry guns. Kobach is against gun control. Kobach advocated for the Convention of States, and has frequently voiced his support for states' rights. Kobach supports strict abortion regulations and identifies as pro-life. He has also stated that he \"supports mandatory prison sentences for selling illegal drugs.\"\nIn June 2017, Kobach advocated for the ending of state tuition funding for illegal immigrants, and called for mass deportations of illegal immigrants. Kobach has also been criticized for saying that he would do nothing, if elected, to ensure protections for LGBTQ workers in Kansas.\nBarack Obama's citizenship.\nKobach repeatedly called on President Barack Obama to release his birth certificate and defended those who persisted in claiming that Obama may have been born outside the United States, specifically in Kenya. As Kansas Secretary of State, he requested additional evidence of Obama's birth before he would allow Obama to appear on Kansas ballots for the 2012 presidential election, even after the release of Obama's long-form birth certificate. In 2009, Kobach \"joked at a GOP barbecue that Obama and God had something in common because neither has a birth certificate.\" Kobach responded to criticism of the joke with \"Lighten up. It's just a joke... Are they really suggesting it is forbidden to tell jokes about Barack Obama?\"\nIn 2010, during his candidacy for the Kansas secretary of state, Kobach said Obama could end the controversy over his citizenship by producing a \"long-form\" birth certificate. In the preceding two years, judges had termed such suits \"frivolous.\" These included U.S. District Judge R. Barclay Surrick of Philadelphia, who had thrown out a lawsuit on the issue, saying it was a waste of the court's time. Kobach said that the certificate released by Obama \"doesn't have a doctor's signature on it. ... Look, until a court says otherwise, I'm willing to accept that he's a natural U.S. citizen. But I think it is a fair question: Why just not produce the long-form birth certificate?\"\nIn September 2012, while leading the three-person State Objections Board, and joined by Kansas Attorney General Derek Schmidt and Kansas Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer, Kobach requested additional evidence, including the product of investigations from Mississippi and Arizona, that Obama was born in the United States. Kobach said he did not have enough evidence to determine if Obama could appear on the Kansas ballot for the 2012 presidential election. \"The New York Times\" editorialized that the actions of the Kansas authorities \"reignited long-running conspiracy theories that the president was not born in the United States.\" CNN reported that \"the Kansas ballot measure is one of\u00a0several examples\u00a0of the birther movement's still-persistent presence.\" At the time, Obama had released his long-form birth certificate but \"CBS News\" noted that \"so-called \"birthers\" persist with a variety of arguments that he is ineligible for the presidency. Generally, they claim that the birth certificate as released by the president is a forgery or that he is not eligible for the presidency despite being born in Hawaii.\" Kobach maintained that the questioning of Obama's citizenship was not frivolous. Later that September, after a complainant dropped his challenge of Obama's eligibility for the Kansas ballot and after Hawaii officials sent a note to Kobach saying that Obama's birth certificate was genuine, Kobach allowed Obama to remain on the ballot and said, \"That, for me, settles the issue\".\nIn 2016, Kobach said that there are \"interesting things\" about the question of Obama's citizenship that \"just made you scratch your head.\" Kobach said that Obama's opposition to the Kansas proof of citizenship requirement law was possibly because the president was not a citizen himself: \"maybe that's why he doesn't talk about proof of citizenship, because he, you know, he would rather not bring up the citizenship issue.\"\nPersonal life and activities.\nKobach was born in Madison, Wisconsin, to Janice Mardell (n\u00e9e Iverson) and William Louis Kobach. His great-grandparents were Bohemian and German on his father's side and Norwegian on his mother's side; they came to Wisconsin in the 1890s, where they were mostly farmers.\nAt the age of seven, in 1974, Kobach moved to Kansas with his parents and two sisters, and grew up mostly in Topeka where his father owned the Bill Kobach Buick-GMC car dealership.\nKobach was married on June 23, 2001 to Heather Mannschreck, a former environmental systems engineer who now has a part-time photography business in addition to homeschooling their five daughters. Kobach, his wife, and their children live on their farm near Lecompton, north of Lawrence, Kansas. Their residence is in a building, the permits for which Kobach originally received lower taxation and permitting fees due to claimed intent for agricultural exemptions, rather than residential use. He stated he intends to build a residential home on the property. When building it, Kobach \"closed in\" the plumbing and electric work so it was not possible for the building inspector to examine it without tearing up the floor and removing walls that covered wiring. There was no septic system or water source. Despite those difficulties, he was granted permit waivers by the county administration, precipitating public controversy.\nKobach served as a missionary to Uganda in 2005 and 2006. Previously, he had volunteered to help build a school in a South African township through the Get Ahead Foundation. He served as a Big Brother. He was a national rowing champion (men's pair event, master's division in 1998; men's double event, master's division, 2001, 2002). He is an Eagle Scout.\nOn February 7, 2018, the Better Business Bureau (BBB) issued an \"F\" rating, its lowest possible rating, for a Missouri-based group called Veterans in Defense of Liberty (VIDOL). The BBB found that the 501(c)(4) organization received less than 6% of $1.4 million in donations solicited for the organization. Over 94% of funds went to American Target Advertising (ATA), a Virginia-based company which mailed solicitations for donations. Kobach, who has no military background, said he joined the group's advisory board because he cares \"deeply about veterans and veterans' issues\" and would review the organization's financial records to determine whether to sever ties with the group. In July 2019, VIDOL said it had revised its previous IRS 990 form to reflect a much lower percentage of its revenues going to Richard Viguerie's conservative fundraising apparatus, ATA. Seventeen months later, on July 12, 2019, it was reported that despite the VIDOL organization's difficulties, Kobach still remained on its board of directors. The St. Louis Better Business Bureau indicated it did not have sufficient evidence to revive its original \"F\" rating. Chris Thetford, spokesman for the Bureau, said Magill's group doesn't currently have a revised rating because its IRS form 990 for 2017 wasn't yet publicly available, so the bureau backed its initial consumer warning, one remaining online with a clarification from the advertising firm about the prodigious costs of outsourcing direct mailings. He said if consumers desire to write a check to the organization they should be told that their contributions are not being solicited for a charitable cause. Thetford further said, \"The real issue here...It was not conspicuously disclosed to people on their marketing materials that donations were not tax deductible.\"\nIn October 2020, Kobach pitched a line of products to Kansas legislators with businessman Daniel Drake, claiming their Sarus Systems products would \"kill COVID.\" Their claims were characterized as misleading and unsubstantiated by an independent investigation, done over a two-month period by the \"Columbia Journalism Review\".\nElectoral history.\n "}
{"title": "Leon_Trotsky", "label": "Politician", "text": "Lev Davidovich Bronstein ( \u2013 21 August 1940), better known as Leon Trotsky (), was a Ukrainian-Russian Marxist revolutionary, political theorist and politician. Ideologically a communist, he developed a variant of Marxism which has become known as Trotskyism.\nBorn into a wealthy Ukrainian-Jewish family in Yanovka (present-day Bereslavka in Ukraine), Trotsky embraced Marxism after moving to Nikolayev in 1896. In 1898, Tsarist authorities arrested him for revolutionary activities and subsequently exiled him to Siberia. He escaped from Siberia in 1902 and moved to London, where he befriended Vladimir Lenin. In 1903, he sided with Julius Martov's Mensheviks against Lenin's Bolsheviks during the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party's initial organisational split. Trotsky helped organize the failed Russian Revolution of 1905, after which he was again arrested and exiled to Siberia. He once again escaped, and spent the following 10 years working in Britain, Austria, Switzerland, France, Spain, and the United States. After the 1917 February Revolution brought an end to the Tsarist monarchy, Trotsky returned from New York via Canada to Russia and became a leader in the Bolshevik faction. As chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, he played a key role in the October Revolution of November 1917 that overthrew the new Provisional Government.\nOnce in government, Trotsky initially held the post of Commissar for Foreign Affairs and became directly involved in the 1917\u20131918 Brest-Litovsk negotiations with Germany as Russia pulled out of the First World War. From March 1918 to January 1925, Trotsky headed the Red Army as People's Commissar for Military and Naval Affairs and played a vital role in the Bolshevik victory in the Russian Civil War of 1917\u20131922. He became one of the seven members of the first Bolshevik Politburo in 1919.\nAfter the death of Lenin (January 1924) and the rise of Joseph Stalin, Trotsky gradually lost his government positions; the Politburo eventually expelled him from the Soviet Union in February 1929. He spent the rest of his life in exile, writing prolifically and engaging in open critique of Stalinism. In 1938 Trotsky and his supporters founded the Fourth International in opposition to Stalin's Comintern. After surviving multiple attempts on his life, Trotsky was assassinated in August 1940 in Mexico City by Ram\u00f3n Mercader, an agent of the Soviet NKVD. Written out of Soviet history books under Stalin, Trotsky was one of the few Soviet political personalities whom the Soviet administration under Nikita Khrushchev did not rehabilitate in the 1950s.\nChildhood and family (1879\u20131895).\nLeon Trotsky was born Lev Davidovich Bronstein to David Leontyevich Bronstein (1847\u20131922) and Anna Lvovna (n\u00e9e Zhivotovskaya, 1850\u20131910) on 7 November 1879, the fifth child of a Ukrainian Jewish family of wealthy farmers in Yanovka or Yanivka, in the Kherson governorate of the Russian Empire (now Bereslavka, in Ukraine), a small village from the nearest post office. His father, David Leontyevich, had lived in Poltava, and later moved to Bereslavka, as it had a large Jewish community. The language spoken at home was a mixture of Russian and Ukrainian (known as Surzhyk). Trotsky's younger sister, Olga, who also grew up to be a Bolshevik and a Soviet politician, married the prominent Bolshevik Lev Kamenev.\nSome authors, notably Robert Service, have claimed that Trotsky's childhood first name was the Yiddish \"Leiba\". The American Trotskyist David North said that this was an assumption based on Trotsky's Jewish birth, but, contrary to Service's claims, there is no documentary evidence to support his using a Yiddish name, when that language was not spoken by his family. Both North and political historian Walter Laqueur wrote that Trotsky's childhood name was \"Lyova\", a standard Russian diminutive of the name \"Lev.\" North has compared the speculation on Trotsky's given name to the undue emphasis given to his having a Jewish surname.\nWhen Trotsky was eight, his father sent him to Odessa to be educated. He was enrolled in a German-language school, which became Russified during his years in Odessa as a result of the Imperial government's policy of Russification. As Isaac Deutscher notes in his biography of Trotsky, Odessa was then a bustling cosmopolitan port city, very unlike the typical Russian city of the time. This environment contributed to the development of the young man's international outlook.\nAlthough Trotsky spoke French, English, and German to a good standard, he said in his autobiography \"My Life\" that he was never perfectly fluent in any language but Russian. Raymond Molinier wrote that Trotsky spoke French fluently.\nEarly political activities and life (1896\u20131917).\nRevolutionary activity and imprisonment (1896\u20131898).\nTrotsky became involved in revolutionary activities in 1896 after moving to the harbor town of Nikolayev (now Mykolaiv) on the Ukrainian coast of the Black Sea. At first a \"narodnik\" (revolutionary agrarian socialist populist), he initially opposed Marxism but was won over to Marxism later that year by his future first wife, Aleksandra Sokolovskaya. Instead of pursuing a mathematics degree, Trotsky helped organize the South Russian Workers' Union in Nikolayev in early 1897. Using the name \"Lvov\", he wrote and printed leaflets and proclamations, distributed revolutionary pamphlets, and popularized socialist ideas among industrial workers and revolutionary students.\nIn January 1898, more than 200 members of the union, including Trotsky, were arrested. He was held for the next two years in prison waiting trial, first in Nikolayev, then Kherson, then Odessa, and finally in Moscow. In the Moscow prison, he came into contact with other revolutionaries, heard about Lenin and read Lenin's book, \"The Development of Capitalism in Russia\". Two months into his imprisonment, on 1\u20133 March 1898, the first Congress of the newly formed Russian Social Democratic Labor Party (RSDLP) was held. From then on Trotsky identified as a member of the party.\nFirst marriage and Siberian exile (1899\u20131902).\nWhile in the prison in Moscow, in the summer of 1899, Trotsky married Aleksandra Sokolovskaya (1872\u20131938), a fellow Marxist. The wedding ceremony was performed by a Jewish chaplain.\nIn 1900, he was sentenced to four years in exile in Siberia. Because of their marriage, Trotsky and his wife were allowed to be exiled to the same location in Siberia. They were exiled to Ust-Kut and the Verkholensk in the Baikal Lake region of Siberia. They had two daughters, Zinaida (1901\u20131933) and Nina (1902\u20131928), both born in Siberia.\nIn Siberia, Trotsky studied philosophy. He became aware of the differences within the party, which had been decimated by arrests in 1898 and 1899. Some social democrats known as \"economists\" argued that the party should focus on helping industrial workers improve their lot in life and were not so worried about changing the government. They believed that societal reforms would grow out of the worker's struggle for higher pay and better working conditions. Others argued that overthrowing the monarchy was more important and that a well-organized and disciplined revolutionary party was essential. The latter position was expressed by the London-based newspaper \"Iskra\" (\"The Spark\"), which was founded in 1900. Trotsky quickly sided with the \"Iskra\" position and began writing for the paper.\nIn the summer of 1902, at the urging of his wife, Aleksandra, Trotsky escaped from Siberia hidden in a load of hay on a wagon. Aleksandra later escaped from Siberia with their daughters. Both daughters married, and Zinaida had children, but the daughters died before their parents. Nina Nevelson died from tuberculosis in 1928, cared for in her last months by her older sister. Zinaida Volkova followed her father into exile in Berlin, taking her son by her second marriage but leaving behind a daughter in Russia. Suffering also from tuberculosis and depression, Zinaida committed suicide in 1933. Aleksandra disappeared in 1935 during the Great Purges in the Soviet Union under Stalin and was murdered by Stalinist forces three years later.\nFirst emigration and second marriage (1902\u20131903).\nUntil this point in his life, Trotsky had used his birth name: Lev (Leon) Bronstein. He changed his surname to \"Trotsky\", the name he would use for the rest of his life. It is said he adopted the name of a jailer of the Odessa prison in which he had earlier been held. This became his primary revolutionary pseudonym. After his escape from Siberia, Trotsky moved to London, joining Georgi Plekhanov, Vladimir Lenin, Julius Martov and other editors of \"Iskra\". Under the pen name \"Pero\" (\"feather\" or \"pen\"), Trotsky soon became one of the paper's leading writers.\nUnknown to Trotsky, the six editors of \"Iskra\" were evenly split between the \"old guard\" led by Plekhanov and the \"new guard\" led by Lenin and Martov. Plekhanov's supporters were older (in their 40s and 50s), and had spent the previous 20 years together in exile in Europe. Members of the new guard were in their early 30s and had only recently emigrated from Russia. Lenin, who was trying to establish a permanent majority against Plekhanov within \"Iskra,\" expected Trotsky, then 23, to side with the new guard. In March 1903 Lenin wrote:\nBecause of Plekhanov's opposition, Trotsky did not become a full member of the board. But from then on, he participated in its meetings in an advisory capacity, which earned him Plekhanov's enmity.\nIn late 1902, Trotsky met Natalia Sedova (1882\u20131962), who soon became his companion. They married in 1903, and she was with him until his death. They had two children together, Lev Sedov (1906\u20131938) and Sergei Sedov (1908\u20131937), both of whom would predecease their parents. Regarding his sons' surnames, Trotsky later explained that after the 1917 revolution:\nTrotsky never used the name \"Sedov\" either privately or publicly. Natalia Sedova sometimes signed her name \"Sedova-Trotskaya\".\nSplit with Lenin (1903\u20131904).\nIn the meantime, after a period of secret police repression and internal confusion that followed the First Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party in 1898, \"Iskra\" succeeded in convening the party's Second Congress in London in August 1903. Trotsky and other \"Iskra\" editors attended. The first congress went as planned, with \"Iskra\" supporters handily defeating the few \"economist\" delegates. Then the congress discussed the position of the Jewish Bund, which had co-founded the RSDLP in 1898 but wanted to remain autonomous within the party.\nShortly after that, the pro-Iskra delegates unexpectedly split into two factions. The split was initially over an organisational issue. Lenin and his supporters, the Bolsheviks, argued for a smaller but highly organized party where only party members would be seen as members, while Martov and his supporters, the Mensheviks, argued for a bigger and less disciplined party where people who assisted the party would also be seen as members. In a surprise development, Trotsky and most of the Iskra editors supported Martov and the Mensheviks, while Plekhanov supported Lenin and the Bolsheviks. During 1903 and 1904, many members changed sides in the factions. Plekhanov soon parted ways with the Bolsheviks. Trotsky left the Mensheviks in September 1904 over their insistence on an alliance with Russian liberals and their opposition to a reconciliation with Lenin and the Bolsheviks.\nFrom 1904 until 1917, Trotsky described himself as a \"non-factional social democrat\". He worked between 1904 and 1917, trying to reconcile different groups within the party, which resulted in many clashes with Lenin and other prominent party members. Trotsky later maintained that he had been wrong in opposing Lenin on the issue of the party. During these years, Trotsky began developing his theory of permanent revolution and developed a close working relationship with Alexander Parvus in 1904\u201307.\nDuring their split, Lenin referred to Trotsky as \"Little Judas\" (\"Iudushka\", based on the character from Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin's novel \"The Golovlyov Family\"), a \"scoundrel\" and a \"swine\".\n1905 revolution and trial (1905\u20131906).\nThe unrest and agitation against the Russian government came to a head in Saint Petersburg on 3 January 1905 (Julian Calendar), when a strike broke out at the Putilov Works in the city. This single strike grew into a general strike, and by 7 January 1905, there were 140,000 strikers in Saint Petersburg.\nOn Sunday, 9 January 1905, Father Georgi Gapon led a peaceful procession of citizens through the streets to the Winter Palace to beseech the Tsar for food and relief from the oppressive government. The Palace Guard fired on the peaceful demonstration, resulting in the deaths of some 1,000 demonstrators. Sunday, 9 January 1905, became known as Bloody Sunday.\nFollowing the events of Bloody Sunday, Trotsky secretly returned to Russia in February 1905, by way of Kyiv. At first he wrote leaflets for an underground printing press in Kyiv, but soon moved to the capital, Saint Petersburg. There he worked with both Bolsheviks, such as Central Committee member Leonid Krasin, and the local Menshevik committee, which he pushed in a more radical direction. The latter, however, were betrayed by a secret police agent in May, and Trotsky had to flee to rural Finland. There he worked on fleshing out his theory of permanent revolution.\nOn 19 September 1905, the typesetters at the Ivan Sytin's printing house in Moscow went out on strike for shorter hours and higher pay. By the evening of 24 September, the workers at 50 other printing shops in Moscow were also on strike. On 2 October 1905, the typesetters in printing shops in Saint Petersburg decided to strike in support of the Moscow strikers. On 7 October 1905, the railway workers of the Moscow\u2013Kazan Railway went out on strike. Amid the resulting confusion, Trotsky returned from Finland to Saint Petersburg on 15 October 1905. On that day, Trotsky spoke before the Saint Petersburg Soviet Council of Workers Deputies, which was meeting at the Technological Institute in the city. Also attending were some 200,000 people crowded outside to hear the speeches\u2014about half of all workers in Saint Petersburg.\nAfter his return, Trotsky and Parvus took over the newspaper \"Russian Gazette,\" increasing its circulation to 500,000. Trotsky also co-founded, together with Parvus and Julius Martov and other Mensheviks, \"Nachalo\" (\"The Beginning\"), which also proved to be a very successful newspaper in the revolutionary atmosphere of Saint Petersburg in 1905.\nJust before Trotsky's return, the Mensheviks had independently come up with the same idea that Trotsky had: an elected non-party revolutionary organization representing the capital's workers, the first Soviet (\"Council\") of Workers. By the time of Trotsky's arrival, the Saint Petersburg Soviet was already functioning headed by Khrustalyev-Nosar (Georgy Nosar, alias Pyotr Khrustalyov). Khrustalyev-Nosar had been a compromise figure when elected as the head of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Khrustalev-Nosar was a lawyer that stood above the political factions contained in the Soviet.\nHowever, since his election, he proved to be very popular with the workers in spite of the Bolsheviks' original opposition to him. Khrustalev-Nosar became famous in his position as spokesman for the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Indeed, to the outside world, Khrustalev-Nosar was the embodiment of the Saint Petersburg Soviet. Trotsky joined the Soviet under the name \"Yanovsky\" (after the village he was born in, Yanovka) and was elected vice-chairman. He did much of the actual work at the Soviet and, after Khrustalev-Nosar's arrest on 26 November 1905, was elected its chairman. On 2 December, the Soviet issued a proclamation which included the following statement about the Tsarist government and its foreign debts: \nThe following day, the Soviet was surrounded by troops loyal to the government and the deputies were arrested. Trotsky and other Soviet leaders were tried in 1906 on charges of supporting an armed rebellion. On 4 October 1906 he was convicted and sentenced to internal exile to Siberia.\nSecond emigration (1907\u20131914).\nWhile en route to exile in Obdorsk, Siberia, in January 1907, Trotsky escaped at Berezov and once again made his way to London. He attended the 5th Congress of the RSDLP. In October, he moved to Vienna, Austria-Hungary. For the next seven years, he often took part in the activities of the Austrian Social Democratic Party and, occasionally, of the German Social Democratic Party.\nIn Vienna, Trotsky became close to Adolph Joffe, his friend for the next 20 years, who introduced him to psychoanalysis.\nIn October 1908 he was asked to join the editorial staff of \"Pravda\" (\"Truth\"), a bi-weekly, Russian-language social democratic paper for Russian workers, which he co-edited with Adolph Joffe and Matvey Skobelev. It was smuggled into Russia. The paper appeared very irregularly; only five issues were published in its first year.\nAvoiding factional politics, the paper proved popular with Russian industrial workers. Both the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks split multiple times after the failure of the 1905\u20131907 revolution. Money was very scarce for the publication of \"Pravda\". Trotsky approached the Russian Central Committee to seek financial backing for the newspaper throughout 1909.\nA majority of Bolsheviks controlled the Central Committee in 1910. Lenin agreed to the financing of \"Pravda\" but required a Bolshevik to be appointed as co-editor of the paper. When various Bolshevik and Menshevik factions tried to re-unite at the January 1910 RSDLP Central Committee meeting in Paris over Lenin's objections, Trotsky's \"Pravda\" was made a party-financed 'central organ'. Lev Kamenev, Trotsky's brother-in-law, was added to the editorial board from the Bolsheviks, but the unification attempts failed in August 1910. Kamenev resigned from the board amid mutual recriminations. Trotsky continued publishing \"Pravda\" for another two years until it finally folded in April 1912.\nThe Bolsheviks started a new workers-oriented newspaper in Saint Petersburg on 22 April 1912 and also called it \"Pravda\". Trotsky was so upset by what he saw as a usurpation of his newspaper's name that in April 1913, he wrote a letter to Nikolay Chkheidze, a Menshevik leader, bitterly denouncing Lenin and the Bolsheviks. Though he quickly got over the disagreement, the message was intercepted by the Russian police, and a copy was put into their archives. Shortly after Lenin's death in 1924, the letter was found and publicized by Trotsky's opponents within the Communist Party to portray him as Lenin's enemy.\nThe 1910s were a period of heightened tension within the RSDLP, leading to numerous frictions between Trotsky, the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The most serious disagreement that Trotsky and the Mensheviks had with Lenin at the time was over the issue of \"expropriations\", i.e., armed robbery of banks and other companies by Bolshevik groups to procure money for the Party. These actions had been banned by the 5th Congress, but were continued by the Bolsheviks.\nIn January 1912, the majority of the Bolshevik faction, led by Lenin, as well as a few defecting Mensheviks, held a conference in Prague and decided to break away from the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party, and formed a new party, the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (Bolsheviks). In response, Trotsky organized a \"unification\" conference of social democratic factions in Vienna in August 1912 (a.k.a. \"The August Bloc\") and tried to re-unite the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks into one party. The attempt was generally unsuccessful.\nIn Vienna, Trotsky continuously published articles in radical Russian and Ukrainian newspapers, such as \"Kievskaya Mysl,\" under a variety of pseudonyms, often using \"Antid Oto\". In September 1912, \"Kievskaya Mysl\" sent him to the Balkans as its war correspondent, where he covered the two Balkan Wars for the next year. While there, Trotsky chronicled the ethnic cleansing carried out by the Serbian army against the Albanian civilian population. He became a close friend of Christian Rakovsky, later a leading Soviet politician and Trotsky's ally in the Soviet Communist Party. On 3 August 1914, at the outbreak of World War I, in which Austria-Hungary fought against the Russian Empire, Trotsky was forced to flee Vienna for neutral Switzerland to avoid arrest as a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9.\nWorld War I (1914\u20131917).\nThe outbreak of World War I caused a sudden realignment within the RSDLP and other European social democratic parties over the issues of war, revolution, pacifism and internationalism, redividing the party into defeatists and defencists. Within the RSDLP, Lenin, Trotsky and Martov advocated various internationalist anti-war positions that saw defeat for your own country's ruling class imperialists as the \"lesser evil\" in the war, while they opposed all imperialists in the imperialist war. These anti-war believers were known as \"defeatists\". Those who supported one side over the other in the war were known as \"defencists\". Plekhanov and many other defencist social democrats (both Bolsheviks and Mensheviks) supported the Russian government to some extent and wanted them to win the war, while Trotsky's ex-colleague Parvus, now a defencist, sided against Russia so strongly that he wanted Germany to win the war. In Switzerland, Trotsky briefly worked within the Swiss Socialist Party, prompting it to adopt an internationalist resolution. He wrote a book opposing the war, \"The War and the International,\" and the pro-war position taken by the European social democratic parties, primarily the German party.\nAs a war correspondent for the \"Kievskaya Mysl\", Trotsky moved to France on 19 November 1914. In January 1915 in Paris, he began editing (at first with Martov, who soon resigned as the paper moved to the left) \"Nashe Slovo\" (\"Our Word\"), an internationalist socialist newspaper. He adopted the slogan of \"peace without indemnities or annexations, peace without conquerors or conquered.\" Lenin advocated Russia's defeat in the war and demanded a complete break with the Second International.\nTrotsky attended the Zimmerwald Conference of anti-war socialists in September 1915 and advocated a middle course between those who, like Martov, would stay within the Second International at any cost and those who, like Lenin, would break with the Second International and form a Third International. The conference adopted the middle line proposed by Trotsky. At first opposed, in the end Lenin voted for Trotsky's resolution to avoid a split among anti-war socialists.\nIn September 1916, Trotsky was deported from France to Spain for his anti-war activities. Spanish authorities did not want him and deported him to the United States on 25 December 1916. He arrived in New York City on 13 January 1917. He stayed for nearly three months at 1522 Vyse Avenue in The Bronx. In New York he wrote articles for the local Russian language socialist newspaper, \"Novy Mir,\" and the Yiddish-language daily, \"Der Forverts\" (\"The Jewish Daily Forward\"), in translation. He also made speeches to Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9s.\nTrotsky was living in New York City when the February Revolution of 1917 overthrew Tsar Nicholas II. He left New York on 27 March 1917, but his ship, the \"SS Kristianiafjord,\" was intercepted by British naval officials in Canada at Halifax, Nova Scotia. He was detained for a month at Amherst Internment Camp in Nova Scotia. While imprisoned in the camp, Trotsky established an increasing friendship with the workers and sailors amongst his fellow inmates, describing his month at the camp as \"one continual mass meeting\".\nTrotsky's speeches and agitation incurred the wrath of German officer inmates who complained to the British camp commander, Colonel Morris, about Trotsky's \"anti-patriotic\" attitude. Morris then forbade Trotsky to make any more public speeches, leading to 530 prisoners protesting and signing a petition against Morris' order. Back in Russia, after initial hesitation and facing pressure from the workers' and peasants' Soviets, the Russian foreign minister Pavel Milyukov was compelled to demand the release of Trotsky as a Russian citizen, and the British government freed him on 29 April 1917.\nHe reached Russia on 17 May 1917. After his return, Trotsky substantially agreed with the Bolshevik position, but did not join them right away. Russian social democrats were split into at least six groups, and the Bolsheviks were waiting for the next party Congress to determine which factions to merge with. Trotsky temporarily joined the Mezhraiontsy, a regional social democratic organization in Saint Petersburg, and became one of its leaders. At the First Congress of Soviets in June, he was elected a member of the first All-Russian Central Executive Committee (\"VTsIK\") from the Mezhraiontsy faction.\nAfter an unsuccessful pro-Bolshevik uprising in Saint Petersburg, Trotsky was arrested on 7 August 1917. He was released 40 days later in the aftermath of the failed counter-revolutionary uprising by Lavr Kornilov. After the Bolsheviks gained a majority in the Petrograd Soviet, Trotsky was elected chairman on . He sided with Lenin against Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev when the Bolshevik Central Committee discussed staging an armed uprising, and he led the efforts to overthrow the Provisional Government headed by Aleksandr Kerensky.\nThe following summary of Trotsky's role in 1917 was written by Stalin in \"Pravda\", 6 November 1918. Although this passage was quoted in Stalin's book \"The October Revolution\" (1934), it was expunged from Stalin's \"Works\" (1949).\nAfter the success of the uprising on 7\u20138 November 1917, Trotsky led the efforts to repel a counter-attack by Cossacks under General Pyotr Krasnov and other troops still loyal to the overthrown Provisional Government at Gatchina. Allied with Lenin, he defeated attempts by other Bolshevik Central Committee members (Zinoviev, Kamenev, Rykov, etc.) to share power with other socialist parties. By the end of 1917, Trotsky was unquestionably the second man in the Bolshevik Party after Lenin. He overshadowed the ambitious Zinoviev, who had been Lenin's top lieutenant over the previous decade, but whose star appeared to be fading. This reversal of position contributed to continuing competition and enmity between the two men, which lasted until 1926 and did much to destroy them both.\nOn 23 November 1917 Trotsky revealed the secret treaty arrangements which had been made between the Tsarist Regime, Britain and France, causing them considerable embarrassment.\nRussian Revolution and aftermath.\nCommissar for Foreign Affairs and Brest-Litovsk (1917\u20131918).\nAfter the Bolsheviks came to power, Trotsky became the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs and published the secret treaties previously signed by the Triple Entente that detailed plans for post-war reallocation of colonies and redrawing state borders.\nIn preparation for peace talks with the representatives of the German government and the representatives of the other Central Powers leading up to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, Leon Trotsky appointed his old friend Adolph Joffe to represent the Bolsheviks. When the Soviet delegation learned that Germans and Austro-Hungarian planned to annex slices of Polish territory and to set up a rump Polish state with what remained, while the Baltic provinces were to become client states ruled by German princes, the talks were recessed for 12 days. The Soviets' only hopes were that given time their allies would agree to join the negotiations or that the western European proletariat would revolt, so their best strategy was to prolong the negotiations. As Foreign Minister Leon Trotsky wrote, \"To delay negotiations, there must be someone to do the delaying\". Therefore Trotsky replaced Joffe as the leader of the Soviet delegation during the peace negotiations in Brest-Litovsk from 22 December 1917 to 10 February 1918. At that time the Soviet government was split on the issue. Left Communists, led by Nikolai Bukharin, continued to believe that there could be no peace between a Soviet republic and a capitalist country and that only a revolutionary war leading to a pan-European Soviet republic would bring a durable peace.\nThey cited the successes of the newly formed (15 January 1918) voluntary Red Army against Polish forces of Gen. J\u00f3zef Dowbor-Mu\u015bnicki in Belarus, White forces in the Don region, and newly independent Ukrainian forces as proof that the Red Army could repel German forces, especially if propaganda and asymmetrical warfare were used.\nThey were willing to hold talks with the Germans as a means of exposing German imperial ambitions (territorial gains, reparations, etc.) in the hope of accelerating the hoped\u2212for Soviet revolution in the West. Still, they were dead set against signing any peace treaty. In the case of a German ultimatum, they advocated proclaiming a revolutionary war against Germany to inspire Russian and European workers to fight for socialism. This opinion was shared by Left Socialist Revolutionaries, who were then the Bolsheviks' junior partners in a coalition government.\nLenin, who had earlier hoped for a speedy Soviet revolution in Germany and other parts of Europe, quickly decided that the imperial government of Germany was still firmly in control and that, without a strong Russian military, an armed conflict with Germany would lead to a collapse of the Soviet government in Russia. He agreed with the Left Communists that ultimately a pan-European Soviet revolution would solve all problems, but until then the Bolsheviks had to stay in power. Lenin did not mind prolonging the negotiating process for maximum propaganda effect, but, from January 1918 on, advocated signing a separate peace treaty if faced with a German ultimatum. Trotsky's position was between these two Bolshevik factions. Like Lenin, he admitted that the old Russian military, inherited from the monarchy and the Provisional Government and in advanced stages of decomposition, was unable to fight:\nBut he agreed with the Left Communists that a separate peace treaty with an imperialist power would be a terrible morale and material blow to the Soviet government, negate all its military and political successes of 1917 and 1918, resurrect the notion that the Bolsheviks secretly allied with the German government, and cause an upsurge of internal resistance. He argued that any German ultimatum should be refused, and that this might well lead to an uprising in Germany, or at least inspire German soldiers to disobey their officers since any German offensive would be a naked grab for territories. Trotsky wrote in 1925:\nGermany resumed military operations on 18 February. Within a day, it became clear that the German army was capable of conducting offensive operations and that Red Army detachments, which were relatively small, poorly organized and poorly led, were no match for it. On the evening of 18 February 1918, Trotsky and his supporters in the committee abstained, and Lenin's proposal was accepted 7\u20134. The Soviet government sent a radiogram to the German side, taking the final Brest-Litovsk peace terms.\nGermany did not respond for three days and continued its offensive, encountering little resistance. The response arrived on 21 February, but the proposed terms were so harsh that even Lenin briefly thought that the Soviet government had no choice but to fight. But in the end, the committee again voted 7\u20134 on 23 February 1918; the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was signed on 3 March and ratified on 15 March 1918. Since Trotsky was so closely associated with the policy previously followed by the Soviet delegation at Brest-Litovsk, he resigned from his position as Commissar for Foreign Affairs to remove a potential obstacle to the new policy.\nHead of the Red Army (spring 1918).\nThe entire Bolshevik leadership of the Red Army, including People's Commissar (defence minister) Nikolai Podvoisky and commander-in-chief Nikolai Krylenko, protested vigorously and eventually resigned. They believed that the Red Army should consist only of dedicated revolutionaries, rely on propaganda and force, and have elected officers. They viewed former imperial officers and generals as potential traitors who should be kept out of the new military, much less put in charge of it. Their views continued to be popular with many Bolsheviks throughout most of the Russian Civil War, and their supporters, including Podvoisky, who became one of Trotsky's deputies, were a constant thorn in Trotsky's side. The discontent with Trotsky's policies of strict discipline, conscription and reliance on carefully supervised non-Communist military experts eventually led to the Military Opposition (Russian: ), which was active within the Communist Party in late 1918\u20131919.\nOn 13 March 1918, Trotsky's resignation as Commissar for Foreign Affairs was officially accepted, and he was appointed People's Commissar of Army and Navy Affairs\u2014in place of Podvoisky\u2014and chairman of the Supreme Military Council. The post of commander-in-chief was abolished, and Trotsky gained full control of the Red Army, responsible only to the Communist Party leadership, whose Left Socialist Revolutionary allies had left the government over Brest-Litovsk.\nCivil War (1918\u20131920).\n1918.\nThe military situation soon tested Trotsky's managerial and organization-building skills. In May\u2013June 1918, the Czechoslovak Legions \"en route\" from European Russia to Vladivostok rose against the Soviet government. This left the Bolsheviks with the loss of most of the country's territory, an increasingly well-organized resistance by Russian anti-Communist forces (usually referred to as the White Army after their best-known component) and widespread defection by the military experts whom Trotsky relied on.\nTrotsky and the government responded with a full-fledged mobilisation, which increased the size of the Red Army from fewer than 300,000 in May 1918 to one million in October, and an introduction of political commissars into the army. The latter had the task of ensuring the loyalty of military experts (mostly former officers in the imperial army) and co-signing their orders. Trotsky regarded the organisation of the Red Army as built on the ideas of the October Revolution. As he later wrote in his autobiography:\nIn response to Fanya Kaplan's failed assassination of Lenin on 30 August 1918, and to the successful assassination of the Petrograd Cheka chief Moisei Uritsky on 17 August 1918, the Bolsheviks instructed Felix Dzerzhinsky to commence a Red Terror, announced in the 1 September 1918 issue of the \"Krasnaya Gazeta\" (\"Red Gazette\"). Regarding the Red Terror Trotsky wrote:\nIn dealing with deserters, Trotsky often appealed to them politically, arousing them with the ideas of the Revolution.\nGiven the lack of manpower and the 16 opposing foreign armies, Trotsky also insisted on the use of former Tsarist officers as military specialists within the Red Army, in combination with Bolshevik political commissars to ensure the revolutionary nature of the Red Army. Lenin commented on this:\nIn September 1918, the Bolshevik government, facing continuous military difficulties, declared what amounted to martial law and reorganized the Red Army. The Supreme Military Council was abolished, and the position of commander-in-chief was restored, filled by the commander of the Latvian Riflemen, Loakim Vatsetis (a.k.a. Jukums V\u0101cietis), who had formerly led the Eastern Front against the Czechoslovak Legions. Vatsetis took charge of the day-to-day operations of the army. At the same time, Trotsky became chairman of the newly formed Revolutionary Military Council of the Republic and retained overall control of the military. Trotsky and Vatsetis had clashed earlier in 1918, while Vatsetis and Trotsky's adviser Mikhail Bonch-Bruevich were also on unfriendly terms. Nevertheless, Trotsky eventually established a working relationship with the often prickly Vatsetis.\nThe reorganization caused yet another conflict between Trotsky and Stalin in late September. Trotsky appointed former imperial general Pavel Pavlovich Sytin to command the Southern Front, but in early October 1918 Stalin refused to accept him and so he was recalled from the front. Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov tried to make Trotsky and Stalin reconcile, but their meeting proved unsuccessful.\n1919.\nThroughout late 1918 and early 1919, there were a number of attacks on Trotsky's leadership of the Red Army, including veiled accusations in newspaper articles inspired by Stalin and a direct attack by the Military Opposition at the VIIIth Party Congress in March 1919. On the surface, he weathered them successfully and was elected one of only five full members of the first Politburo after the Congress. But he later wrote:\nIn mid-1919, the dissatisfied had an opportunity to mount a serious challenge to Trotsky's leadership: the Red Army grew from 800,000 to 3,000,000 and fought simultaneously on sixteen fronts.\nAt the 3\u20134 July Central Committee meeting, after a heated exchange, the majority supported Kamenev and Smilga against V\u0101cietis and Trotsky. Trotsky's plan was rejected, and he was much criticized for various alleged shortcomings in his leadership style, much of it of a personal nature. Stalin used this opportunity to pressure Lenin to dismiss Trotsky from his post.\nHowever, some significant changes to the leadership of the Red Army were made. Trotsky was temporarily sent to the Southern Front, while Smilga informally coordinated the work in Moscow. Most members of the Revolutionary Military Council who were not involved in its day-to-day operations were relieved of their duties on 8 July, and new members, including Smilga, were added. The same day, while Trotsky was in the south, V\u0101cietis was suddenly arrested by the Cheka on suspicion of involvement in an anti-Soviet plot, and replaced by Sergey Kamenev. After a few weeks in the south, Trotsky returned to Moscow and resumed control of the Red Army. A year later, Smilga and Tukhachevsky were defeated during the Battle of Warsaw, but Trotsky refused this opportunity to pay Smilga back, which earned him Smilga's friendship and later his support during the intra-Party battles of the 1920s.\nBy October 1919, the government was in the worst crisis of the Civil War: Denikin's troops approached Tula and Moscow from the south, and General Nikolay Yudenich's troops approached Petrograd from the west. Lenin decided that since it was more important to defend Moscow, Petrograd would have to be abandoned. Trotsky argued that Petrograd needed to be defended, at least in part to prevent Estonia and Finland from intervening. In a rare reversal, Trotsky was supported by Stalin and Zinoviev, and prevailed against Lenin in the Central Committee.\n1920.\nWith the defeat of Denikin and Yudenich in late 1919, the Soviet government's emphasis shifted to the economy. Trotsky spent the winter of 1919\u201320 in the Urals region trying to restart its economy. A false rumor of his assassination circulated in Germany and the international press on New Year's Day 1920. Based on his experiences, he proposed abandoning the policies of War Communism, which included confiscating grain from peasants, and partially restoring the grain market. Still committed to War Communism, Lenin rejected his proposal.\nIn early 1920, Soviet\u2013Polish tensions eventually led to the Polish\u2013Soviet War. In the run-up and during the war, Trotsky argued that the Red Army was exhausted and the Soviet government should sign a peace treaty with Poland as soon as possible. He did not believe that the Red Army would find much support in Poland proper. Lenin later wrote that he and other Bolshevik leaders believed the Red Army's successes in the Russian Civil War and against the Poles meant \"The defensive period of the war with worldwide imperialism was over, and we could, and had the obligation to, exploit the military situation to launch an offensive war.\"\nPoland defeated the Red Army, and the offensive was turned back during the Battle of Warsaw in August 1920, in part because of Stalin's failure to obey Trotsky's orders in the run-up to the decisive engagements. Back in Moscow, Trotsky again argued for a peace treaty, and this time prevailed.\nTrade union debate (1920\u20131921).\nTrotsky's position formed while he led a special commission on the Soviet transportation system, Tsektran. He was appointed there to rebuild the rail system ruined by the Civil War. Being the Commissar of War and a revolutionary military leader, he saw a need to create a militarized \"production atmosphere\" by incorporating trade unions directly into the State apparatus. His unyielding stance was that in a worker's state, the workers should have nothing to fear from the State, and the State should fully control the unions. In the Ninth Party Congress, he argued for: \"...a regime in which every worker feels himself a soldier of labour, who cannot dispose of himself freely; if the order is given to transfer him, he must carry it out; if he does not carry it out, he will be a deserter who is punished. Who looks after this? The trade unions. It creates the new regime. This is the militarisation of the working class.\"\nLenin sharply criticized Trotsky and accused him of \"bureaucratically nagging the trade unions\" and of staging \"factional attacks.\" His view did not focus on State control as much as the concern that a new relationship was needed between the State and the rank-and-file workers. He said, \"Introduction of genuine labour discipline is conceived only if the whole mass of participants in productions takes a conscious part in the fulfillment of these tasks. Bureaucratic methods and orders from above cannot achieve this.\" This was a debate that Lenin thought the party could not afford. His frustration with Trotsky was used by Stalin and Zinoviev with their support for Lenin's position, to improve their standing within the Bolshevik leadership at Trotsky's expense.\nDisagreements threatened to get out of hand, and many Bolsheviks, including Lenin, feared that the party would splinter. The Central Committee was split almost evenly between Lenin's and Trotsky's supporters, with all three Secretaries of the Central Committee (Krestinsky, Yevgeny Preobrazhensky and Leonid Serebryakov) supporting Trotsky.\nAt a meeting of his faction at the Tenth Party Congress in March 1921, Lenin's faction won a decisive victory, and a number of Trotsky's supporters (including all three secretaries of the Central Committee) lost their leadership positions. Krestinsky was replaced as a member of the Politburo by Zinoviev, who had supported Lenin. Krestinsky's place in the secretariat was taken by Vyacheslav Molotov. The congress also adopted a secret resolution on \"Party unity\", which banned factions within the Party except during pre-Congress discussions. The resolution was later published and used by Stalin against Trotsky and other opponents.\nAt the end of the Tenth Congress, after peace negotiations had failed, Trotsky gave the order for the suppression of the Kronstadt rebellion, the last major revolt against Bolshevik rule. Trotsky's role was questioned by other socialists, including ex-Trotskyists. In the United States, Dwight Macdonald broke with Trotsky and left the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party by noting the Kronstadt rebellion. A similar critique of Trotsky's role in the Kronstadt rebellion was raised by American anarchist Emma Goldman. In her essay \"Trotsky Protests Too Much\", she states, \"I admit, the dictatorship under Stalin's rule has become monstrous. That does not, however, lessen the guilt of Leon Trotsky as one of the actors in the revolutionary drama of which Kronstadt was one of the bloodiest scenes\". Some Trotskyists, most notably Abbie Bakan, have argued that the claim that the Kronstadt rebels were \"counterrevolutionary\" has been supported by evidence of White Army and French government support for the Kronstadt sailors' March rebellion. Other historians, most notably Paul Avrich, claimed the evidence did not point towards this conclusion, and saw the Kronstadt Rebellion as spontaneous.\nTrotsky's contribution to the Russian Revolution.\nVladimir Cherniaev, a leading Russian historian, sums up Trotsky's main contributions to the Russian Revolution:\nHistorian Geoffrey Swain argues that:\nLenin said in 1921 that Trotsky was \"in love with organisation,\" but in working politics, \"he has not got a clue.\" Swain explains the paradox by arguing that Trotsky was not good at teamwork; he was a loner who had mostly worked as a journalist, not as a professional revolutionary like the others.\nLenin's illness (1922\u20131923).\nIn late 1921, Lenin's health deteriorated and he was absent from Moscow for longer periods of time. He had three strokes between 25 May 1922 and 9 March 1923, which caused paralysis, loss of speech and finally death on 21 January 1924. With Lenin increasingly sidelined throughout 1922, Stalin was elevated to the newly created position of the Central Committee general secretary. Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev became part of the \"troika\" (triumvirate) formed by Stalin to ensure that Trotsky, publicly the number-two man in the country and Lenin's heir presumptive, would not succeed Lenin.\nThe rest of the recently expanded Politburo (Rykov, Mikhail Tomsky, Bukharin) was at first uncommitted, but eventually joined the \"troika.\" Stalin's power of patronage in his capacity as general secretary clearly played a role, but Trotsky and his supporters later concluded that a more fundamental reason was the process of slow bureaucratisation of the Soviet regime once the extreme conditions of the Civil War were over. Much of the Bolshevik elite wanted 'normality,' while Trotsky was personally and politically personified as representing a turbulent revolutionary period that they would much rather leave behind.\nAlthough the exact sequence of events is unclear, evidence suggests that at first the \"troika\" nominated Trotsky to head second-rate government departments (e.g., Gokhran, the State Depository for Valuables). In mid-July 1922, Kamenev wrote a letter to the recovering Lenin to the effect that \"(the Central Committee) is throwing or is ready to throw a good cannon overboard\". Lenin was shocked and responded:\nFrom then until his final stroke, Lenin spent much of his time trying to devise a way to prevent a split within the Communist Party leadership, which was reflected in \"Lenin's Testament.\" As part of this effort, on 11 September 1922 Lenin proposed that Trotsky become his deputy at the Council of People's Commissars (Sovnarkom). The Politburo approved the proposal, but Trotsky \"categorically refused\".\nIn late 1922, Trotsky secured an alliance with Lenin against Stalin and the emerging Soviet bureaucracy. Stalin had recently engineered the creation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), further centralising state control. The alliance proved effective on the issue of foreign trade but was hindered by Lenin's progressing illness.\nIn January 1923, Lenin amended his Testament to suggest that Stalin should be removed as the party's general secretary, while also mildly criticising Trotsky and other Bolshevik leaders. The relationship between Stalin and Lenin had broken down completely by this time, as was demonstrated during an event where Stalin crudely insulted Lenin's wife, Nadezhda Krupskaya. In March 1923, days before his third stroke, Lenin asked Trotsky to denounce Stalin and his so-called \"Great-Russian nationalistic campaign\" at the XIIth Party Congress.\nAt the XIIth Party Congress in April 1923, however, just after Lenin's final stroke, Trotsky did not raise the issue. Instead, he made a speech about intra-party democracy while avoiding any direct confrontation of the \"troika.\" Stalin had prepared for the congress by replacing many local party delegates with those loyal to him, mostly at the expense of Zinoviev and Kamenev's backers.\nThe delegates, most of whom were unaware of the divisions within the Politburo, gave Trotsky a standing ovation. This upset the \"troika\", already infuriated by Karl Radek's article, \"Leon Trotsky \u2013 Organiser of Victory\" published in \"Pravda\" on 14 March 1923. Stalin delivered the key reports on organisational structure and questions of nationality; while Zinoviev delivered the Central Committee political report, traditionally Lenin's prerogative. Among the resolutions adopted by the XIIth Congress were those calling for greater democracy within the Party, but these were vague and remained unimplemented.\nLeft opposition (1923\u20131924).\nStarting in mid-1923, the Soviet economy ran into significant difficulties, which led to numerous strikes countrywide. Two secret groups within the Communist Party, \"Workers' Truth\" and \"Workers' Group\", were uncovered and suppressed by the Soviet secret police. On 8 October 1923 Trotsky sent a letter to the Central Committee and the Central Control Commission, attributing these difficulties to lack of intra-Party democracy. Trotsky wrote:\nOther senior communists who had similar concerns sent \"The Declaration of 46\" to the Central Committee on 15 October in which they wrote:\nAlthough the text of these letters remained secret at the time, they had a significant effect on the Party leadership and prompted a partial retreat by the \"troika\" and its supporters on the issue of intra-Party democracy, notably in Zinoviev's \"Pravda\" article published on 7 November. Throughout November, the \"troika\" tried to come up with a compromise to placate, or at least temporarily neutralise, Trotsky and his supporters. (Their task was made easier by the fact that Trotsky was sick in November and December.) The first draft of the resolution was rejected by Trotsky, which led to the formation of a special group consisting of Stalin, Trotsky and Kamenev, which was charged with drafting a mutually acceptable compromise. On 5 December, the Politburo and the Central Control Commission unanimously adopted the group's final draft as its resolution. On 8 December, Trotsky published an open letter, in which he expounded on the recently adopted resolution's ideas. The \"troika\" used his letter as an excuse to launch a campaign against Trotsky, accusing him of factionalism, setting \"the youth against the fundamental generation of old revolutionary Bolsheviks\" and other sins.\nTrotsky defended his position in a series of seven letters which were collected as \"The New Course\" in January 1924. The illusion of a \"monolithic Bolshevik leadership\" was thus shattered and a lively intra-Party discussion ensued, both in local Party organizations and in the pages of \"Pravda\". The discussion lasted most of December and January until the XIIIth Party Conference of 16\u201318 January 1924. Those who opposed the Central Committee's position in the debate were thereafter referred to as members of the Left Opposition. In 1924, in a series of conferences at Sverdlov University; Stalin cited several times, in a critic way:'the Permanentists', as the followers of Trotsky 'Permanent revolution'.\nSince the \"troika\" controlled the Party apparatus through Stalin's Secretariat and \"Pravda\" through its editor Bukharin, it was able to direct the discussion and the process of delegate selection. Although Trotsky's position prevailed within the Red Army and Moscow universities and received about half the votes in the Moscow Party organisation, it was defeated elsewhere, and the Conference was packed with pro-\"troika\" delegates. In the end, only three delegates voted for Trotsky's position, and the Conference denounced \"Trotskyism\" as a \"petty bourgeois deviation\".\nAfter Lenin's death (1924).\nThere was little overt political disagreement within the Soviet leadership throughout most of 1924. On the surface, Trotsky remained the most prominent and popular Bolshevik leader, although his \"mistakes\" were often alluded to by \"troika\" partisans. Behind the scenes, he was completely cut off from the decision-making process. Politburo meetings were pure formalities since all key decisions were made ahead of time by the \"troika\" and its supporters. Trotsky's control over the military was undermined by reassigning his deputy, Ephraim Sklyansky, and appointing Mikhail Frunze, who was being groomed to take Trotsky's place.\nAt the thirteenth Party Congress in May, Trotsky delivered a conciliatory speech:\nIn the meantime, the Left Opposition, which had coagulated somewhat unexpectedly in late 1923 and lacked a definite platform aside from general dissatisfaction with the intra-Party \"regime\", began to crystallise. It lost some less dedicated members to the harassment by the \"troika\", but it also began formulating a program.\nconomically, the Left Opposition and its theoretician Yevgeni Preobrazhensky came out against further development of capitalist elements in the Soviet economy and in favour of faster industrialisation. That put them at odds with Bukharin and Rykov, the \"Right\" group within the Party, who supported the \"troika\" at the time. On the question of world revolution, Trotsky and Karl Radek saw a period of stability in Europe while Stalin and Zinoviev confidently predicted an \"acceleration\" of revolution in Western Europe in 1924. On the theoretical plane, Trotsky remained committed to the Bolshevik idea that the Soviet Union could not create a true socialist society in the absence of the world revolution, while Stalin gradually came up with a policy of building 'Socialism in One Country'. These ideological divisions provided much of the intellectual basis for the political divide between Trotsky and the Left Opposition on the one hand and Stalin and his allies on the other.\nAt the thirteenth Congress Kamenev and Zinoviev helped Stalin defuse Lenin's Testament, which belatedly came to the surface. But just after the congress, the \"troika\", always an alliance of convenience, showed signs of weakness. Stalin began making poorly veiled accusations about Zinoviev and Kamenev. Yet in October 1924, Trotsky published \"Lessons of October,\" an extensive summary of the events of the 1917 revolution.\nIn it, he described Zinoviev's and Kamenev's opposition to the Bolshevik seizure of power in 1917, something that the two would have preferred be left unmentioned. This started a new round of intra-party struggle, which became known as the \"Literary Discussion\", with Zinoviev and Kamenev again allied with Stalin against Trotsky. Their criticism of Trotsky was concentrated in three areas:\nTrotsky was again sick and unable to respond while his opponents mobilised all of their resources to denounce him. They succeeded in damaging his military reputation so much that he was forced to resign as People's Commissar of Army and Fleet Affairs and Chairman of the Revolutionary Military Council on 6 January 1925. Zinoviev demanded Trotsky's expulsion from the Communist Party, but Stalin refused to go along and played the role of a moderate. Trotsky kept his Politburo seat, but was effectively put on probation.\nA year in the wilderness (1925).\nFor Trotsky, 1925 was a difficult year. After the bruising \"Literary Discussion\" and losing his Red Army posts, he was effectively unemployed throughout the winter and spring. In May 1925, he was given three posts: chairman of the Concessions Committee, head of the electro-technical board, and chairman of the scientific-technical board of industry. Trotsky wrote in \"My Life\" that he \"was taking a rest from politics\" and \"naturally plunged into the new line of work up to my ears\".\nSome contemporary accounts paint a picture of a remote and distracted man. Later in the year, Trotsky resigned his two technical positions (maintaining Stalin-instigated interference and sabotage) and concentrated on his work in the Concessions Committee.\nIn one of the few political developments that affected Trotsky in 1925, the circumstances of the controversy over Lenin's Testament were described by American Marxist Max Eastman in his book \"Since Lenin Died\" (1925). Trotsky denied these statements made by Eastman in an article he wrote.\nIn the meantime, the \"troika\" finally broke up. Bukharin and Rykov sided with Stalin while Krupskaya and Soviet Commissar of Finance Grigory Sokolnikov aligned with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The struggle became open at the September 1925 meeting of the Central Committee and came to a head at the XIV Party Congress in December 1925. With only the Leningrad Party organization behind them, Zinoviev and Kamenev, dubbed \"The New Opposition\", were thoroughly defeated while Trotsky refused to get involved in the fight and did not speak at the Congress.\nUnited Opposition (1926\u20131927).\nIn early 1926, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters in the \"New Opposition\" gravitated closer to Trotsky's supporters, and the two groups soon formed an alliance, which also incorporated some smaller opposition groups within the Communist Party. The alliance became known as the United Opposition.\nThe United Opposition was repeatedly threatened with sanctions by the Stalinist leadership of the Communist Party, and Trotsky had to agree to tactical retreats, mostly to preserve his alliance with Zinoviev and Kamenev. The opposition remained united against Stalin throughout 1926 and 1927, especially on the issue of the Chinese Revolution. The methods used by the Stalinists against the Opposition became more and more extreme. At the XV Party Conference in October 1926, Trotsky could barely speak because of interruptions and catcalls, and at the end of the Conference he lost his Politburo seat. In 1927, Stalin started using the GPU (Soviet secret police) to infiltrate and discredit the opposition. Rank-and-file oppositionists were increasingly harassed, sometimes expelled from the Party and even arrested.\nSoviet policy toward the Chinese Revolution became the ideological line of demarcation between Stalin and the United Opposition. The Chinese Revolution began on 10 October 1911, resulting in the abdication of the Chinese Emperor, Puyi, on 12 February 1912. Sun Yat-sen established the Republic of China.\nIn reality, however, the Republic controlled very little of the country. Much of China was divided between various regional warlords. The Republican government established a new \"nationalist people's army and a national people's party\"\u2014the Kuomintang. In 1920, the Kuomintang opened relations with Soviet Russia. With Soviet help, the Republic of China built up the nationalist people's army. With the development of the nationalist army, a Northern Expedition was planned to smash the power of the warlords of the northern part of the country. This Northern Expedition became a point of contention over foreign policy by Stalin and Trotsky. Stalin tried to persuade the small Chinese Communist Party to merge with the Kuomintang (KMT) Nationalists to bring about a bourgeois revolution before attempting to bring about a Soviet-style working class revolution.\nTrotsky wanted the Communist Party to complete an orthodox proletarian revolution and have clear class independence from the KMT. Stalin funded the KMT during the expedition. Stalin countered Trotskyist criticism by making a secret speech in which he said that Chiang's right-wing Kuomintang were the only ones capable of defeating the imperialists, that Chiang Kai-shek had funding from the rich merchants, and that his forces were to be utilized until squeezed for all usefulness like a lemon before being discarded. However, Chiang quickly reversed the tables in the Shanghai massacre of 12 April 1927 by massacring the Communist Party in Shanghai midway through the Northern Expedition.\nDefeat and exile (1927\u20131928).\nDuring this time Trotsky gave the eulogy at the funeral of his friend, the Soviet diplomat Adolph Joffe, in November 1927. It would be the last speech that Trotsky would give in the Soviet Union. When the XV Party Congress made United Opposition views incompatible with membership in the Communist Party, Zinoviev, Kamenev and their supporters capitulated and renounced their alliance with the Left Opposition. Trotsky and most of his followers, on the other hand, refused to surrender and stayed the course. Trotsky was exiled to Alma Ata, Kazakhstan on 31 January 1928. He was expelled from the Soviet Union to Turkey in February 1929, accompanied by his wife Natalia Sedova and their eldest son, Lev.\nFate of Left Oppositionists after Trotsky's exile (1929\u20131941).\nAfter Trotsky's expulsion from the Soviet Union, Trotskyists within the Soviet Union began to waver. Between 1929 and 1932, most leading members of the Left Opposition surrendered to Stalin, \"admitted their mistakes\" and were reinstated in the Communist Party. One initial exception to this was Christian Rakovsky, who inspired Trotsky between 1929 and 1934 with his refusal to capitulate as state suppression of any remaining opposition to Stalin increased by the year. In late 1932, Rakovsky had failed with an attempt to flee the Soviet Union and was exiled to Yakutia in March 1933. Answering Trotsky's request, the French mathematician and Trotskyist Jean Van Heijenoort, together with his fellow activist Pierre Frank, unsuccessfully called on the influential Soviet author Maxim Gorky to intervene in favor of Christian Rakovsky, and boarded the ship he was traveling on near Constantinople. According to Heijenoort, they only managed to meet Gorky's son, Maxim Peshkov, who reportedly told them that his father was indisposed, but promised to pass on their request. Rakovsky was the last prominent Trotskyist to capitulate to Stalin in April 1934, when Rakovsky formally \"admitted his mistakes\" (his letter to \"Pravda\", titled \"There Should Be No Mercy\", depicted Trotsky and his supporters as \"agents of the German Gestapo\"). Rakovsky was appointed to high office in the Commissariat for Health and allowed to return to Moscow, also serving as Soviet ambassador to Japan in 1935. However, Rakovsky was cited in allegations involving the killing of Sergey Kirov, and was arrested and imprisoned in late 1937, during the Great Purge.\nAlmost all Trotskyists who were still within the Soviet Union's borders were executed in the Great Purges of 1936\u20131938, although Rakovsky survived until the Medvedev Forest massacre of September 1941, where he was shot dead along with 156 other prisoners on Stalin's orders, less than three months into the Axis invasion of the Soviet Union. Also among the Medvedev Forest victims was Trotsky's sister/Kamenev's first wife, Olga Kameneva.\nExile (1929\u20131940).\nIn February 1929, Trotsky was deported from the Soviet Union to his new exile in Turkey. During his first two months in Turkey, Trotsky lived with his wife and eldest son at the Soviet Union Consulate in Istanbul and then at a nearby hotel in the city. In April 1929, Trotsky, his wife and son were moved to the island of B\u00fcy\u00fckada by the Turkish authorities. On B\u00fcy\u00fckada, they were moved into a house called the Yanaros mansion. During his exile in Turkey, Trotsky was under the surveillance of the Turkish police forces of Mustafa Kemal Pasha. Trotsky was also at risk from the many former White Army officers who lived on Prinkipo, officers who had opposed the October Revolution and who had been defeated by Trotsky and the Red Army in the Russian Civil War. However, Trotsky's European supporters volunteered to serve as bodyguards and assured his safety. At this time, he made requests to enter Belgium, France, Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom, but all refused access.\nIn 1931, Trotsky wrote a letter to a friend entitled \"What is Fascism\" in which he attempted to define fascism and asserted that the Comintern was wrong to describe the Dictatorship of Primo de Rivera as \"fascist\" because it wasn't a mass movement arising from a base in the lower classes.\nOn 20 February 1932, Trotsky and all of his family lost their Soviet citizenship and were forbidden to enter the Soviet Union. In 1932, Trotsky entered via a port into the fascist Kingdom of Italy on his way to a socialist conference in Denmark. By the end of 1932, Trotsky had joined a conspiratorial political bloc with the anti-Stalin opposition inside the USSR. There was no evidence of any alliance with Nazi Germany or Japan, as the Soviet Union government claimed. The alleged members of the anti-Stalin bloc were Zinovievites, rightists and Trotskyists who \"capitulated\" to Stalin. Kamenev and Zinoviev were also alleged members of the bloc. Trotsky wanted by no means that the alliance became a fusion, and he was afraid of the right gaining much power inside the bloc. Historian Pierre Brou\u00e9 concluded that the bloc dissolved in early 1933, since some of its members like Zinoviev and Kamenev joined Stalin again, and because there were no letters in the Trotsky Harvard archive mentioning the bloc after 1932. In July 1933, Trotsky was offered asylum in France by Prime Minister \u00c9douard Daladier. Trotsky accepted the offer, but he was forbidden to live in Paris and soon found himself under the surveillance of the French police. From July 1933 to February 1934, Trotsky and his wife lived in Royan. The philosopher and activist Simone Weil also arranged for Trotsky and his bodyguards to stay for a few days at her parents' house. Following the 6 February 1934 crisis in France, the French minister of internal affairs, Albert Sarraut, signed a decree to deport Trotsky from France. However, no foreign government was found willing to accept Trotsky within its borders. Accordingly, the French authorities instructed Trotsky to move to a residence in the tiny village of Barbizon under the strict surveillance of the French police, where Trotsky found his contact with the outside world to be even worse than during his exile in Turkey.\nIn May 1935, soon after the French government had agreed to the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance with the Soviet Union government, Trotsky was officially told that he was no longer welcome in France. After weighing his options, Trotsky applied to move to Norway. After obtaining permission from Justice Minister Trygve Lie to enter the country, Trotsky and his wife became a guest of Konrad Knudsen at Norderhov, near H\u00f8nefoss, and spent over a year living at Knudsen's house, from 18 June 1935 to 2 September 1936, although Trotsky was hospitalized for a few weeks at the nearby Oslo Community Hospital from 19 September 1935.\u00a0\nFollowing French media complaints about Trotsky's role in encouraging the mass strikes in France in May and June 1936 with his articles, the Johan Nygaardsvold-led Norwegian government began to exhibit disquiet about Trotsky's actions. In the summer of 1936, Trotsky's asylum was increasingly made a political issue by the fascist Nasjonal Samling, led by Vidkun Quisling,\u00a0 along with an increase in pressure from the Soviet government on the Norwegian authorities. On 5 August 1936, Knudsen's house was burgled by fascists from the Nasjonal Samling while Trotsky and his wife were out on a seashore trip with Knudsen and his wife. The burglars targeted Trotsky's works and archives for vandalism. The raid was largely thwarted by Knudsen's daughter, Hj\u00f8rdis, although the burglars did take a few papers from the nearest table as they left. Although the perpetrators were caught and put on trial, the \"evidence\" obtained in the burglary was used by the government to make claims against Trotsky.\u00a0\nOn 14 August 1936, the Soviet Press Agency TASS announced the discovery of a \"Trotskyist\u2013Zinovievist\" plot and the imminent start of the Trial of the Sixteen accused. Trotsky demanded a complete and open enquiry into Moscow's accusations. The accused were sentenced to death, including Grigory Zinoviev and Lev Kamenev, and executed on 25 August 1936. On 26 August 1936, eight policemen arrived at Knudsen's house demanding that Trotsky sign new conditions for residing in Norway. These conditions included agreeing to write no more about current political matters, to give no interviews, and to have all his correspondence (incoming and outgoing) inspected by the police. Trotsky categorically refused the conditions, and Trotsky was then told that he and his wife would soon be moved to another residence. The following day Trotsky was interrogated by the police about his political activities, with the police officially citing Trotsky as a \"witness\" to the fascist raid of 5 August 1936.\nOn 2 September 1936, four weeks after the break-in at Knudsen's house, Trygve Lie ordered that Trotsky and his wife be transferred to a farm in Hurum, where they were under house arrest.\u00a0 The treatment of Trotsky and his wife at Hurum was harsh, as they were forced to stay indoors for 22 hours per day under the constant guard of thirteen policemen, with only one hour permitted twice a day for a walk on the farm.\u00a0 Trotsky was prevented from posting any letters and prevented from arguing back against his critics in Norway and beyond. Only Trotsky's lawyers and the Norwegian Labour Party Parliamentary leader, Olav Scheflo, were permitted to visit.\u00a0 From October 1936, even the outdoor walks were prohibited for Trotsky and his wife.\u00a0 Trotsky did eventually manage to smuggle out one letter on 18 December 1936, titled \"The Moscow \"Confessions\"\". On 19 December 1936, Trotsky and his wife were deported from Norway after being put on the Norwegian oil tanker \"Ruth\", under guard by Jonas Lie. When later living in Mexico, Trotsky was utterly scathing about the treatment he received during his 108 days at Hurum, and accused the Norwegian government of trying to prevent him from publicly voicing his strong opposition to the Trial of the Sixteen and other show trials, saying:\nThe \"Ruth\" arrived in Mexico on 9 January 1937.\u00a0 On Trotsky's arrival, the Mexican president, L\u00e1zaro C\u00e1rdenas, welcomed Trotsky to Mexico and arranged for his special train \"The Hidalgo\" to bring Trotsky to Mexico City from the port of Tampico.\nFrom January 1937 to April 1939, Trotsky and his wife lived in the Coyoac\u00e1n area of Mexico City at La Casa Azul (The Blue House), the home of the painter Diego Rivera and Rivera's wife and fellow painter, Frida Kahlo, with whom Trotsky had an affair. His final move was a few blocks away to a residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939, following a break with Rivera.\nTrotsky wrote prolifically while in exile, penning several key works, including his \"History of the Russian Revolution\" (1930) and \"The Revolution Betrayed\" (1936), a critique of the Soviet Union under Stalinism. He argued that the Soviet state had become a \"degenerated workers' state\" controlled by an undemocratic bureaucracy, which would eventually either be overthrown via a political revolution establishing a workers' democracy, or degenerate into a capitalist class.\nWhile in Mexico, Trotsky also worked closely with James P. Cannon, Joseph Hansen, and Farrell Dobbs of the Socialist Workers Party of the United States, and other supporters. Cannon, a long-time leading member of the American communist movement, had supported Trotsky in the struggle against Stalinism since he had first read Trotsky's criticisms of the Soviet Union in 1928. Trotsky's critique of the Stalinist regime, though banned, was distributed to leaders of the Comintern. Among his other supporters was Chen Duxiu, founder of the Chinese Communist Party.\nWhile in Mexico, Trotsky worked with Andr\u00e9 Breton and Diego Rivera to write the Manifesto for an Independent Revolutionary Art, which inspired the creation of the organization, the International Federation of Independent Revolutionary Art (FIARI) in 1938. This organization was short-lived and ended before 1940.\nMoscow show trials.\nIn August 1936, the first Moscow show trial of the so-called \"Trotskyite\u2013Zinovievite Terrorist Center\" was staged in front of an international audience. During the trial, Zinoviev, Kamenev and 14 other accused, most of them prominent Old Bolsheviks, confessed to having plotted with Trotsky to kill Stalin and other members of the Soviet leadership. The court found everybody guilty and sentenced the defendants to death, Trotsky, in absentia. The second show trial of Karl Radek, Grigori Sokolnikov, Yuri Pyatakov and 14 others, took place in January 1937, during which more alleged conspiracies and crimes were linked to Trotsky. The findings were published in the book \"Not Guilty\".\nFourth International.\nFor fear of splitting the Communist movement, Trotsky initially opposed the idea of establishing parallel Communist parties or a parallel international Communist organization that would compete with the Third International. In mid-1933, after the Nazi takeover in Germany and the Comintern's response to it, he changed his mind. He said:\nIn 1938, Trotsky and his supporters founded the Fourth International, which was intended to be a revolutionary and internationalist alternative to the Stalinist Comintern.\nDies Committee.\nTowards the end of 1939, Trotsky agreed to go to the United States to appear as a witness before the Dies Committee of the House of Representatives, a forerunner of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. Representative Martin Dies Jr., chairman of the committee, demanded the suppression of the American Communist Party. Trotsky intended to use the forum to expose the NKVD's activities against him and his followers.\nHe made it clear that he also intended to argue against the suppression of the American Communist Party and to use the committee as a platform for a call to transform World War II into a world revolution. Many of his supporters argued against his appearance. When the committee learned the nature of the testimony Trotsky intended to present, it refused to hear him, and he was denied a visa to enter the United States. On hearing about it, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union immediately accused Trotsky of being in the pay of the oil magnates and the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\nFinal months.\nAfter quarreling with Diego Rivera, Trotsky moved to his final residence on Avenida Viena in April 1939. On 27 February 1940, Trotsky wrote a document known as \"Trotsky's Testament\", in which he expressed his final thoughts and feelings for posterity. He was suffering from high blood pressure, and feared that he would suffer a cerebral haemorrhage. After forcefully denying Stalin's accusations that he had betrayed the working class, he thanked his friends and above all his wife, Natalia Sedova, for their loyal support:\nAssassination.\nAfter a failed attempt to have Trotsky murdered in March 1939, Stalin assigned the overall organization of implementing the task to the NKVD officer Pavel Sudoplatov, who, in turn, co-opted Nahum Eitingon. According to Sudoplatov's \"Special Tasks\", the NKVD proceeded to set up three NKVD agent networks to carry out the murder; these three networks were designed to operate entirely autonomously from the NKVD's hitherto-established spy networks in the U.S. and Mexico.\nOn 24 May 1940, Trotsky survived a raid on his villa by armed assassins led by the NKVD agent Iosif Grigulevich and Mexican painter David Alfaro Siqueiros. Trotsky's 14-year-old grandson, Vsevolod Platonovich \"Esteban\" Volkov (born 7 March 1926), was shot in the foot. A young assistant and bodyguard of Trotsky, Robert Sheldon Harte, disappeared with the attackers and was later found murdered; it is probable that he was an accomplice who granted them access to the villa. Trotsky's other guards fended off the attackers. Following the failed assassination attempt, Trotsky wrote an article titled \"Stalin Seeks My Death\" on 8 June 1940, in which he stated that another assassination attempt was certain.\nOn 20 August 1940, Trotsky was attacked in his study by Spanish-born NKVD agent Ram\u00f3n Mercader, who used an ice axe as a weapon.\nA mountaineering ice axe has a narrow end, called the pick, and a flat wide end called the adze. The adze of the axe wounded Trotsky, fracturing his parietal bone and penetrating into his brain. The blow to his head was bungled and failed to kill Trotsky instantly. Witnesses stated that Trotsky spat on Mercader and began struggling fiercely with him, which resulted in Mercader's hand being broken. Hearing the commotion, Trotsky's bodyguards burst into the room and nearly beat Mercader to death, but Trotsky stopped them, laboriously stating that the assassin should be made to answer questions. Trotsky was then taken to a hospital and operated on, surviving for more than a day, but dying, at the age of 60, on 21 August 1940 from exsanguination and shock. Mercader later testified at his trial:\nAccording to James P. Cannon, the Trotskyist secretary of the American Socialist Workers Party, Trotsky's last words were \"I will not survive this attack. Stalin has finally accomplished the task he attempted unsuccessfully before.\" Mercader was tried and convicted of the murder and spent the next 20 years in a Mexican prison. Stalin wrote that the assassin of Trotsky was a dangerous Trotskyist. This is why Mercader had no awards initially, though his mother was presented with the Order of Lenin for her own part of the operation. Ram\u00f3n Mercader could not be either assassinated or freed from prison by the Soviets. But when he had been released from jail in 1960 and arrived to the USSR in 1961 Leonid Brezhnev signed a sentence to award Ramon Ivanovich Lopez with the Order of Lenin, the Gold Star of the Hero, and the title of the Hero of the Soviet Union \"for the special deed\". The KGB boss Alexander Shelepin presented all these awards to Ram\u00f3n Mercader in person.\nLegacy.\nTrotsky's house in Coyoac\u00e1n has been preserved in much the same condition as it was on the day he was assassinated there, and is now the Leon Trotsky Museum in Mexico City, run by a board which includes his grandson Esteban Volkov. Trotsky's grave is located on its grounds. The foundation \"International Friends of the Leon Trotsky Museum\" has been organized to raise funds to improve the museum further.\nTrotsky was never formally rehabilitated during the rule of the Soviet government, despite the de-Stalinization-era rehabilitation of most other Old Bolsheviks killed during the Great Purges. His son, Sergei Sedov, who died in 1937, was rehabilitated in 1988, as was Nikolai Bukharin. Beginning in 1989, Trotsky's books, forbidden until 1987, were published in the Soviet Union.\nTrotsky was rehabilitated on 16 June 2001 by the General Prosecutor's Office (Certificates of Rehabilitation No. 13/2182-90, No. 13-2200-99 in Archives Research Center \"Memorial\").\nContributions to Marxist theory.\nTrotsky considered himself to be a \"Bolshevik-Leninist,\" arguing for the establishment of a vanguard party. He viewed himself as an advocate of orthodox Marxism.\nHis politics differed from some aspects from those of Stalin or Mao Zedong, most importantly in his rejection of the theory of Socialism in one country and his declaring of the need for an international \"permanent revolution.\" Numerous Fourth Internationalist groups around the world continue to describe themselves as Trotskyists and see themselves as standing in this tradition. However, they have different interpretations of the conclusions to be drawn from this. Supporters of the Fourth International echo Trotsky's opposition to Stalinist totalitarianism, advocating political revolution and arguing that socialism cannot sustain itself without democracy.\nPermanent Revolution.\nThe Permanent Revolution concept is the theory that the bourgeois democratic tasks in countries with delayed bourgeois democratic development can only be accomplished through the establishment of a workers' state, and that the creation of a workers' state would inevitably involve inroads against capitalist property. Thus, the accomplishment of bourgeois democratic tasks passes over into proletarian tasks. Although most closely associated with Leon Trotsky, the call for a \"Permanent Revolution\" is first found in the writings of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels in March 1850, in the aftermath of the 1848 Revolution, in their Address of the Central Committee to the Communist League:\nTrotsky's conception of the Permanent Revolution is based on his understanding, drawing on the work of the founder of Russian Marxism Georgy Plekhanov, that in 'backward' countries the tasks of the Bourgeois Democratic Revolution could not be achieved by the bourgeoisie itself. Trotsky first developed this conception in collaboration with Alexander Parvus in late 1904\u20131905. The relevant articles were later collected in Trotsky's books \"1905\" and in \"Permanent Revolution\", which also contains his essay \"Results and Prospects.\" Some Trotskyists have argued that the state of the Third World shows that capitalism offers no way forward for underdeveloped countries, thus again proving the central tenet of the theory.\nUnited front.\nTrotsky was a central figure in the Comintern during its first four congresses. During this time, he helped to generalize the strategy and tactics of the Bolsheviks to newly formed Communist parties across Europe and further afield. From 1921 onwards, the united front, a method of uniting revolutionaries and reformists in the common struggle while winning some of the workers to revolution, was the central tactic put forward by the Comintern after the defeat of the German revolution.\nAfter he was exiled and politically marginalized by Stalinism, Trotsky continued to argue for a united front against fascism in Germany and Spain. According to Joseph Choonara of the British Socialist Workers Party in \"International Socialism\", his articles on the united front represent an essential part of his political legacy."}
{"title": "George_Galloway", "label": "Politician", "text": "George Galloway (born 16 August 1954) is a British politician, broadcaster, and writer serving as the leader of the Workers Party of Britain since 2019 and as the founder and lead spokesman of All for Unity since 2020. He currently presents \"The Mother of All Talk Shows\" on Radio Sputnik and \"Sputnik\" on RT UK. Between 1987 and 2010, and then between 2012 and 2015, he was a Member of Parliament (MP) for four constituencies, first for the Labour Party and later the Respect Party, the latter of which he joined in 2004 and led from 2013 until its dissolution in 2016.\nGalloway was born in Dundee to a Scottish father and Irish mother. After becoming the youngest ever chair of the Scottish Labour Party in 1981, he was general secretary of the London-based charity War on Want from 1983 until elected as MP for Glasgow Hillhead (later Glasgow Kelvin) at the 1987 general election. In 2003, Galloway was expelled from the Labour Party for bringing the party into disrepute, including having called on British troops to disobey orders.\nIn 2004, Galloway became a member of the Respect Party, becoming party leader by late 2013. Having decided not to seek re-election for Glasgow Kelvin, he stood for Respect at the 2005 general election for Bethnal Green and Bow, defeating the sitting Labour MP, Oona King. He served for one parliamentary term and did not contest the seat at the 2010 general election. He returned to the House of Commons at the Bradford West by-election in 2012, but lost his seat at the 2015 general election. He stood as the Respect candidate in the 2016 London mayoral election, finishing in seventh place with 1.4% of the vote. He stood as an independent candidate for Manchester Gorton in 2017 and for West Bromwich East in 2019. Following the 2019 general election, he founded the Workers Party of Britain. He led All for Unity, a Scottish party he founded to support British unionism in the face of rising support for Scottish independence and the Scottish National Party (SNP), into the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, where it captured 0.9% of the vote.\nGalloway testified to the United States Senate in 2005 over alleged illicit payments from the United Nations' Oil for Food Program. Galloway supports the Palestinian side in the Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict, opposes Zionism, and was involved in the Viva Palestina aid convoys. Galloway supported Jeremy Corbyn in the 2015 Labour Party leadership election and during Corbyn's leadership of the party. In the 2016 EU membership referendum, he advocated a \"Leave\" vote, campaigning with the cross-party, pro-Brexit organisation Grassroots Out, while before the 2019 European Parliament election he announced on Twitter, \"for one-time only\", he would support Nigel Farage's Brexit Party.\nEarly life and career.\nBackground and education.\nGalloway was born in Dundee, Scotland. His father was a Scottish trade unionist, while his mother was of Irish descent. Initially raised in Lochee, Dundee, he has described himself as \"born in an attic in a slum tenement in the Irish quarter of Dundee, which is known as Tipperary.\" His father began as an electrician, before becoming an electro-mechanical engineer at NCR. After being made redundant, he retrained as a teacher. His mother was a cleaner, and then a factory worker. According to Galloway, his father was patriotic, while his mother had Irish nationalist sympathies, and was critical of perceived British pretensions in the world. Galloway took his mother's side in arguments, and has been a long-time supporter of Sinn F\u00e9in and Irish reunification. David Morley, Galloway's biographer, has written that people who knew both father and son have said that they shared similar Marxist opinions, common in the local Labour movement of the time.\nHe grew up in Charleston, Dundee and attended Charleston Primary and then Harris Academy, a non-denominational school, playing for the school football team as well as for West End United U12s, Lochee Boys Club U16s and St Columba's U18s. According to Galloway, he grew a moustache at the age of 15, and refused to shave it off when his headmaster objected. He decided, at the age of 18, never to drink alcohol; the reason was originally derived from comments by his father, and he has described alcohol as having a \"very deleterious effect on people\".\nLabour Party organiser.\nGalloway joined the Labour Party Young Socialists aged just 13 (although he said he was 15) and was still a teenager when he became secretary of the Dundee Labour Party.\nGalloway became vice-chairman of the Labour Party in the City of Dundee and a member of the Scottish Executive Committee in 1975. On 5 May 1977, he contested his first election campaign in the Scottish district elections, but failed to hold the safe Labour Gillburn ward in Dundee being defeated by the independent Bunty Turley. He became the secretary organiser of the Dundee Labour Party in 1977 and at 26 was the youngest ever chairman of the Scottish Labour Party in March 1981, a post he held for a year after holding the vice-chairman post over the previous year.\nAfter a trip to Beirut, Lebanon during 1977, Galloway became a supporter of Palestine, stating during his libel case against \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2004 that \"barely a week after my return I made a pledge, in the Tavern Bar in Dundee's Hawkhill District, to devote the rest of my life to the Palestinian and Arab cause.\" He supported Dundee City Council when it flew the Palestinian flag over the City Chambers building, and was involved in the twinning of Dundee with the Palestinian West Bank town of Nablus (Shechem) in 1980.\nIn late 1981, Galloway was interviewed for the \"Scottish Marxist\" in which Galloway supported the affiliation of the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) to the Labour Party, in the same way as the Fabian Society does. Believing that a deficiency in political theory was being filled by the entryist infiltration of the party by the Trotskyists (such as the Militant group), Galloway thought the problem was better resolved by communist thinking from members of the CPGB. (He was later opposed to the expulsion of members of Militant.)\nIn response, Denis Healey, Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, tried and failed to remove Galloway from the list of Prospective Parliamentary Candidates. Healey lost his motion by 13 votes to five. Galloway once quipped that, to overcome a \u00a31.5\u00a0million deficit which had arisen in Dundee's city budget, he, Ernie Ross, and leading councillors should be placed in the stocks in the city square: \"we would allow people to throw buckets of water over us at 20p a time.\"\nIn 1983, Galloway attempted to stand for the safe Labour seat of Rhondda after the Welsh Transport and General Workers' Union and the National Union of Miners had both nominated him to succeed Alec Jones, who had died. He hoped to be selected in the newly created seat of Dunfermline East where no incumbent was standing. Galloway failed to be selected for either seat, with Rhondda selecting Allan Rogers and Dunfermline East selecting future Chancellor of the Exchequer and later Prime Minister, Gordon Brown.\nStanding as a candidate for a place on the Labour Party National Executive Committee in 1986, in a large field of 18 candidates, Galloway finished in 16th place.\nWar on Want.\nFrom November 1983 to 1987, Galloway was the general secretary of War on Want, a British charity campaigning against poverty worldwide. In this post he travelled widely, and wrote eye-witness accounts of the famine in Eritrea in 1985 which were published in \"The Sunday Times\" and \"The Spectator\". His deputy at the charity, Simon Stocker, recalled: \"If you went into a fight with George, you knew you would never walk out with a win.\"\nOn 28 October 1986, the \"Daily Mirror\", in a front-page story by Alastair Campbell, claimed Galloway had spent \u00a320,000 in expenses and had been \"enjoying a life of luxury.\" An internal investigation, and later, an independent auditor, both cleared him of the accusation of any misuse of funds, although he did repay \u00a31,720 in contested expenses. The official history of War on Want comments about Galloway that \"even though the problems were not all of his own making, his way of dealing with them heightened tensions\".\nPolitical career (1987\u20132005).\nMember of Parliament for a Glasgow seat.\nAt the 1987 general election, Galloway was elected as the MP for Glasgow Hillhead gaining the seat for Labour from the SDP defeating Roy Jenkins with a majority of 3,251 votes. Although known for his left-wing political views, Galloway was never a member of the Campaign Group.\nIn a 2002 \"Guardian\" interview, Galloway said he had supported the Soviet Union and said that its end was \"the biggest catastrophe of my life\". Galloway told Robert Chalmers of \"The Independent on Sunday\" in June 2012: \"I am not a pacifist. I am a revolutionary. I am a Socialist who doesn't like Capitalism and who likes Imperialism less. I am a revolutionary and I support the armed struggle where there is no alternative.\"\nAt a press gathering for War on Want in September 1987, when Galloway had stood down as general secretary of the organisation, a journalist asked him about his personal arrangements during the previous year's War on Want conference on the Greek island of Mykonos. The new MP replied: \"I travelled and spent lots of time with people in Greece, many of whom were women, some of whom were known carnally to me. I actually had sexual intercourse with some of the people in Greece.\" By then separated from his first wife, Galloway made front-page headlines in the tabloid press at the time. Many years later, in a 2016 \"New Internationalist\" interview, he speculated that an incident of sexual abuse from a colonel, which he suffered when he was 12, has led to a \"lifelong fear of being gay and this led me into ostentatious, rapacious heterosexual promiscuity\".\nIn February 1988, the executive committee of his constituency Labour Party passed a vote of no confidence in him by 15 to 8. The constituency's general management committee voted 54-to-44 in favour of the motion a fortnight later on 22 February, although just three of the 25 members in the trade union section supported it. According to Tam Dalyell in 2003, the new Member of Parliament \"was [the] only one MP that I can recollect making speeches about human rights in Iraq\" in the House of Commons.\nGalloway gained re-selection when challenged by Trish Godman (wife of fellow MP Norman Godman) in June 1989, but failed to get a majority of the electoral college on the first ballot. This was the worst result for any sitting Labour MP who was reselected, but Galloway gained 62% in total in the final vote. Galloway assured his party there would be a \"summer of peace and reconciliation\" in his acceptance speech, but this did not happen. Many members of the party who had supported Godman reportedly refused to work for Galloway in the next election, including Johann Lamont, who later became Leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2011. The following August, 13 of the 26 members of the constituency party's executive committee resigned, including Lamont. According to her, Galloway \"has done nothing to build bridges with the Members of the Executive [Committee of the Constituency Labour Party] who opposed his selection.\" She told a journalist from \"The Guardian\": \"The quarrel we have is all about accountability, and democracy ... working in harmony, rather than any personal matters.\"\nThe Labour Party leadership election in 1992 saw Galloway voting for the eventually successful candidates, John Smith for leader and Margaret Beckett as deputy leader. In 1994, after Smith died, Galloway declined to cast a vote in the leadership election (one of only three MPs to do so). In a debate with the leader of the Scottish National Party, Alex Salmond, Galloway responded to one of Salmond's jibes against Labour by declaring \"I don't give a fuck what Tony Blair thinks\".\nIn 1997, Galloway's Glasgow Hillhead constituency was abolished and, although facing a challenge for the Labour nomination as the candidate for Glasgow Kelvin at the 1997 general election, Galloway defeated Shiona Waldron. He was unchallenged for the nomination for the 2001 general election. Galloway was elected with majorities of 16,643 and 12,014 votes respectively. During the period he was Labour MP for Glasgow Kelvin, from 1997 to 2003, he voted against the whip 32 times, five votes out of 665 (0.8%) in the 1997\u20132001 parliament and the majority (27 votes out of 209 or 12.9%) in the period before he was expelled from the Labour Party. During the 2001\u201302 session, he was the ninth most rebellious Labour MP. Galloway was one of several politicians arrested in February 2001 during a protest at the Faslane nuclear base in Scotland, which led to him being convicted of a breach of the peace and fined \u00a3180.\nIraq from 1991.\nThe first Gulf war.\nGalloway opposed the 1991 Gulf War and was critical of the effect that the subsequent sanctions had on the people of Iraq. In his book \"I'm Not the Only One\" (2004), Galloway expresses the opinion that Kuwait is \"clearly a part of the greater Iraqi whole, stolen from the motherland by perfidious Albion\", although Christopher Hitchens claimed the state existed before Iraq had a name. The massacre of Kurds and Shias just after the 1991 Gulf war, was according to Galloway, \"a civil war that involved massive violence on both sides\".\nWriting for \"The Observer\" in April 2003, David Aaronovitch speculated that Galloway changed his opinion of Saddam Hussein under \"the belief that my enemy's enemy is my friend. Or, in the context of the modern world, any anti-American will do. When Iraq stopped being a friend of the West it became a friend of George's.\"\nMeeting with Saddam Hussein in 1994.\nIn January 1994, Galloway faced some of his strongest criticism on his return from a Middle Eastern visit during which he had met Saddam Hussein. At his meeting with the Iraqi leader, he reported the support given to Saddam by the people of the Gaza Strip which he had just visited: \"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability [...] I can honestly tell you that there was not a single person to whom I told I was coming to Iraq and hoping to meet with yourself who did not wish me to convey their heartfelt, fraternal greetings and support.\" He ended his speech with the statement \"Sir, I salute your courage, your strength, your indefatigability.\" Galloway said that he was saluting the Iraqi people, rather than Saddam Hussein, in the speech, which meaning was accurately translated for the Iraqi leader.\nAs news of the incident reached the UK, Labour leader John Smith, in a statement, said: \"I deeply deplore the foolish statement made in Iraq by Mr. George Galloway. In no way did he speak for the Labour Party and I wholly reject his comments.\" Shortly after his return, Galloway was given a \"severe reprimand\" by the Labour Chief Whip, Derek Foster, for his unauthorised trip to Iraq. The MP apologised for his conduct and undertook to follow future instruction from the whips.\nFor his visit with Saddam, Galloway was dubbed the \"MP for Baghdad North\". Galloway said, when he spoke before the U.S. Senate on 17 May 2005, that he had \"met Saddam Hussein exactly the same number of times as Donald Rumsfeld met him.\" Whereas \"Rumsfeld met him to sell him guns\", Galloway had \"met him to try to bring about an end to sanctions, suffering and war.\"\nThe Mariam Appeal.\nIn 1998, Galloway founded the Mariam Appeal which was intended, according to its website's welcome page in 1999, \"to campaign against sanctions on Iraq which are having disastrous effects on the ordinary people of Iraq\". The campaign was named after Mariam Hamza, a child flown by the fund from Iraq to Britain to receive treatment for leukaemia. The intention was to raise awareness of the suffering and death of hundreds of thousands of other Iraqi children, due to poor health conditions and lack of suitable medicines and facilities, and to campaign for the lifting of the Iraq sanctions that many maintained were responsible for that situation. In 1999, Galloway was criticised for spending Christmas in Iraq with Tariq Aziz, who was Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister at the time. In a 17 May 2005 hearing of the United States Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Galloway stated that he had many meetings with Aziz, and characterised their relationship as friendly. In all, he has admitted to more than 10 meetings with Aziz.\nDuring the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the fund received scrutiny after a complaint that Galloway used some donated money to pay for his travel expenses. He responded by stating that the expenses were incurred in his capacity as the appeal's chairman. Although the Mariam Appeal was never a registered charity and never intended to be such, it was investigated by the Charity Commission. The report of this year-long inquiry, published in June 2004, found that the Mariam Appeal was undertaking charitable work (and so ought to have registered with the commission), but did not substantiate allegations that any funds had been misused. It emerged some years later that Galloway had appealed in a letter dated 24 April 2003 to Lord Goldsmith, the Attorney-General, to stop the investigation into the Mariam Appeal. According to a report in \"The Times\", after the letter was released under the Freedom of Information Act, Galloway falsely asserted that the appeal \"received no money from Iraq\".\nA further Charity Commission Report published on 7 June 2007 found that the appeal had received funds from Fawaz Zureikat that originated from the Oil For Food programme, and concluded that:\n Galloway, in response, stated: \"I've always disputed the Commission's retrospective view that a campaign to win a change in national and international policy \u2013 a political campaign \u2013 was, in fact, a charity\".\nIraq and Saddam Hussein.\nIn a House of Commons debate on 6 March 2002, Foreign Office minister Ben Bradshaw said Galloway was \"not just an apologist, but a mouthpiece, for the Iraqi regime over many years.\" Galloway called the minister a liar and refused to withdraw on the grounds that Bradshaw's claim was \"a clear imputation of dishonour\", and the sitting was suspended due to the dispute. Bradshaw later withdrew his allegation, and Galloway apologised for using unparliamentary language. In an article by Ewen MacAskill published by \"The Guardian\" in March 2000 about a visit by Galloway to Iraq and the Middle East, the politician describes himself as a supporter of the Iraqi people and the Ba'ath Party, but not Saddam Hussein himself.\nIn August 2002, Galloway returned to Iraq and met Saddam Hussein for a second and final time. According to Galloway, the intention of the trip was to persuade Saddam to re-admit Hans Blix, and the United Nations weapons inspectors into the country. \nGiving evidence in his libel case against \"The Daily Telegraph\" newspaper in 2004, Galloway testified that he regarded Saddam as a \"bestial dictator\" and would have welcomed his removal from power, but not by means of a military attack on Iraq. Galloway also pointed out that he was a prominent critic of Saddam Hussein's government in the 1980s, as well as of the role of Margaret Thatcher's government in supporting arms sales to Iraq during the Iran\u2013Iraq War. In his memoir, \"I'm Not the Only One\" first published in 2004, Galloway wrote that \"just as Stalin industrialised the Soviet Union, so on a different scale Saddam plotted Iraq's own Great Leap Forward.\" He continued: \"He managed to keep his country together until 1991. Indeed, he is likely to have been the leader in history who came closest to creating a truly Iraqi national identity, and he developed Iraq and the living, health, social and education standards of his own people.\"\nIn 2006 a video surfaced showing Galloway greeting Uday Hussein, Saddam's eldest son, with the title of \"Excellency\" at Uday's palace in 1999. Galloway is heard saying he will be with Uday \"until the end\". By his own account in \"I'm Not the Only One\", Galloway advised members of Saddam Hussein's government about the ways to deal with a potential American invasion:\nThe Iraq war and Labour Party expulsion.\nGalloway became the vice-president of the Stop the War Coalition in 2001. Actively involved, he often delivered speeches from StWC platforms at anti-war demonstrations. After permission for a rally in Hyde Park during the international anti-war protests on 15 February 2003 was initially refused, Galloway said the government had a choice between \"half a million people at the rally or half a million people in a riot\".\nJust over a month later, Galloway said in a 28 March 2003 interview with Abu Dhabi TV that Tony Blair and George W. Bush had \"lied to the British Air Force and Navy, when they said the battle of Iraq would be very quick and easy. They attacked Iraq like wolves,\" and added that \"the best thing British troops can do is to refuse to obey illegal orders\". This incitement for \"British troops to defy orders\" was later among the formal reasons for his expulsion from the Labour Party.\nOn 18 April 2003, \"The Sun\" published an interview with Tony Blair who said: \"His comments were disgraceful and wrong. The National Executive will deal with it\". At this time, Labour MP Tam Dalyell commented in Galloway's defence: \"I think he is a deeply serious, committed politician and a man of great sincerity about the causes he takes up.\" On 6 May 2003, David Triesman, then general secretary of the Labour Party, suspended Galloway from holding office in the party pending a hearing on charges that he had violated the party's constitution by \"bringing the Labour Party into disrepute through behaviour that is prejudicial or grossly detrimental to the Party.\" Speaking on BBC Radio, Galloway said he stood by every word of the Abu Dhabi interview.\nThe National Constitutional Committee, responsible for internal disciplinary matters, held a hearing on 22 October 2003, to consider the charges, taking evidence from Galloway himself, from other party witnesses, viewing media interviews, and hearing character testimony from former cabinet minister Tony Benn, among others. The following day, the committee decided in favour of four of the five charges accusing Galloway of \"bringing the party into disrepute,\" and expelled Galloway from the Labour Party. A claim that, in a speech, he had congratulated a successful anti-war candidate from the Socialist Alliance in Preston was rejected.\nAccording to Ian McCartney, Labour Party chairman at the time, Galloway was the only Labour MP who \"incited foreign forces to rise up against British troops\" in the Iraq War. Galloway said after the NCC had decided on his expulsion: \"This was a politically motivated kangaroo court whose verdict had been written in advance in the best tradition of political show trials.\" Galloway claimed at the time that other MPs who had opposed the war, such as: Bob Marshall Andrews and Glenda Jackson, would be expelled in due course, but no other MP was expelled from the Labour Party for their statements about the Iraq war. After an article by Galloway was published in the \"Morning Star\" attacking the Labour Party, Tony Benn wrote in his diary in June 2004, quoting from the article, that if he had persuaded the NEC not to expel him, Galloway would have remained \"a member of a party currently run by a 'blood-splattered, lying, crooked group of war criminals'. It put me off George Galloway in a fairly fundamental way\".\nIn 2005, at the time of the Iraq War, Galloway called President George W. Bush the world's \"biggest terrorist\".\nIraq after Saddam Hussein.\nGalloway defended Iraqi insurgents targeting Western forces as \"martyrs\" during August 2005 in appearances on Middle Eastern television channels, Iraqis who were with the allies security forces he called \"collaborators\" and said it was \"normal\" for them to be the targets of suicide bombers. Galloway said: \"These poor Iraqis\u00a0\u2013 ragged people, with their sandals, with their Kalashnikovs, with the lightest and most basic of weapons\u00a0\u2013 are writing the names of their cities and towns in the stars, with 145 military operations every day, which has made the country ungovernable. We don't know who they are, we don't know their names, we never saw their faces, they don't put up photographs of their martyrs, we don't know the names of their leaders\". Galloway was challenged by the BBC but denied making the \"martyrs\" comment.\nGalloway continued to praise Tariq Aziz. In April 2005, on Al Jazeera during that year's general election campaign, he described Aziz as \"an eminent diplomatic and intellectual person\". In his opinion, Aziz was \"a political prisoner\" and Galloway advocated his release.\nOil for Food.\n\"Daily Telegraph\" libel case.\nOn 22 April 2003, \"The Daily Telegraph\" published news articles and comment describing documents found by its reporter David Blair in the ruins of the Iraqi Foreign Ministry. The documents purported to be records of meetings between Galloway and Iraqi intelligence agents, and they stated that he had received \u00a3375,000 per year from the proceeds of the Oil-for-Food Programme. Galloway completely denied the claims and pointed to the nature of the discovery within an unguarded, bombed-out building as being questionable. He instigated legal action against the newspaper, which was heard in the High Court on 14 November 2004.\nOn 2 December, Justice David Eady ruled that the story had been \"seriously defamatory\", and that \"The Daily Telegraph\" was \"obliged to compensate Mr Galloway ... and to make an award for the purposes of restoring his reputation.\" Galloway was awarded damages of \u00a3150,000 plus, after a failed appeal in 2006, legal costs of about \u00a32\u00a0million.\nBoth sides regarded the libel case as an important test of the Reynolds qualified-privilege defence. \"The Daily Telegraph\" did not attempt to claim justification (where the defendant seeks to prove the truth of the defamatory reports): \"It has never been the \"Telegraph's\" case to suggest that the allegations contained in these documents are true\". The newspaper argued that it acted responsibly as the allegations it reported were of sufficient public interest to outweigh the damage caused to Galloway's reputation. The trial judge did not accept this defence, noting that comments such as Galloway being guilty of \"treason\", \"in Saddam's pay\", and being \"Saddam's little helper\" caused him [the judge] to conclude that \"the newspaper was not neutral but both embraced the allegations with relish and fervour and went on to embellish them\"; additionally, the judge ruled, Galloway had not been given a fair or reasonable opportunity to make inquiries or meaningful comment upon the documents before they were published.\nOliver Thorne, a forensic expert later stated \"In my opinion the evidence found fully supports that the vast majority of the submitted documents are authentic\".\nOther libel claims.\nThe \"Christian Science Monitor\" also published a story on 25 April 2003, stating that it had documentary evidence that he had received \"more than ten million dollars\" from the Iraqi government. However, on 20 June 2003, the \"Monitor\" reported that its own investigation had concluded that the documents were sophisticated forgeries.\nGalloway sued the \"Christian Science Monitor\" for libel. In March 2004, Galloway accepted damages and a public apology from the \"Monitor\".\nIn January 2004, a further set of allegations were made in the Iraqi newspaper \"Al-Mada\". The newspaper claimed to have found documents in the Iraqi national oil corporation showing that Galloway received (through an intermediary) some of the profits arising from the sale of 19.5\u00a0million barrels (3,100,000 m\u00b3) of oil. Galloway said that money had been paid into the Mariam Appeal by Iraqi businessmen who had profited from the UN-run programme. He stated he had not benefited personally and that there was nothing illicit about the transaction:\nIn May 2005, \"The Guardian\" reported that \"despite all the investigations in the oil-for-food programme, no one has ever produced any evidence that Iraqi oil money ended up in Mr Galloway's pocket\".\nUS Senate.\nAllegations.\nIn May 2005, a US Senate committee report accused Galloway along with former French minister Charles Pasqua of receiving the right to buy oil under the UN's oil-for-food scheme. The report was issued by the US Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, chaired by Senator Norm Coleman, a Republican from Minnesota.\nColeman's committee said that Pasqua had received allocations worth from 1999 to 2000, and Galloway received allocations worth from 2000 to 2003. The allegations against Pasqua and Galloway, both outspoken opponents of U.N. sanctions against Iraq in the 1990s, have been made before, including in an October report by US arms inspector Charles Duelfer as well as in the various purported documents described earlier in this section.\nGalloway countered the charges by accusing Coleman and other pro-war politicians of covering up the \"theft of billions of dollars of Iraq's wealth... on your watch\" that had occurred under a post-invasion Coalition Provisional Authority, committed by \"Halliburton and other American corporations... with the connivance of your own government.\"\nSenate hearing (17 May 2005).\nOn 17 May 2005, the committee held a hearing concerning specific allegations (of which Galloway was one part) relating to improprieties surrounding the Oil-for-Food programme. Attending Galloway's oral testimony and questioning him were two of the 13 committee members: the chair (Coleman) and the ranking Democrat (Carl Levin).\nOn arriving in the US, he told Reuters, \"I have no expectation of justice from a group of Christian fundamentalist and Zionist activists.\" Galloway described Coleman as a \"pro-war, neocon hawk and the lickspittle of George W. Bush,\" who, he said, sought vengeance against anyone who did not support the war in Iraq.\nIn his testimony, Galloway made the following statements in response to the allegations against him:\nSenate report (October 2005).\nA report by the then-majority Republican Party staff of the United States Senate Committee on Investigations published in October 2005 stated that Galloway had \"knowingly made false or misleading statements under oath\". The report exhibits bank statements, which the authors claim show that $150,000 of proceeds from the Oil-for-Food programme had been paid to Galloway's wife Amineh Abu-Zayyad.\nIt also stated that Galloway (and the Mariam Appeal) received eight allocations of oil from the Iraqi government amounting to 23 million barrels from 1999 to 2003. The Mariam Appeal was also found to have improperly received $446,000 via the Oil-for-Food programme. Tariq Aziz was said to have told the investigators that oil had been allocated in the names of two of Galloway's representatives, Buhan Al-Chalabi and Fawaz Zureikat. Aziz had told the investigators: \"These oil allocations were for the benefit of George Galloway and for Mariam's Appeal. The proceeds from the sale benefited the cause and Mr Galloway\".\nGalloway reiterated his denial of the charges and asked the US Senate committee to charge him with perjury so that he could confront the charges in court. He said the investigation was an attempt to divert attention from the \"pack of lies\" that led to the Iraq invasion in 2003. He claimed Coleman's motive was revenge over the embarrassment of his appearance before the committee in May.\nGalloway also said the claim Aziz had told investigators he had benefited financially, via Zureikat, from the Oil for Food programme had been rejected by Aziz, via his French lawyers. A contemporary UN-supported report written by Paul Volcker, the former American Federal Reserve chairman, stated that eleven million barrels of oil had been reserved in Galloway's name. For Volcker's report, Aziz was interviewed, but his account on this occasion differed from the one he had given the Senate, a change they considered unconvincing.\nBefore and after the 2005 general election.\nFoundation of Respect.\nGalloway announced in December 2003 that he would not force a by-election and did not intend to contest the next general election in Glasgow. His Glasgow Kelvin seat was to be split between three constituencies for the next general election. In one of these, the new Glasgow Central constituency, Mohammad Sarwar, the first Muslim Labour MP, wanted to be selected as the candidate. Galloway chose not to challenge him, announcing this decision at the end of May 2004 in his \"Mail on Sunday\" column.\nGalloway wrote in an article for \"The Guardian\" at the end of October 2003 that he would soon be part of a coalition consisting of the \"red, green, anti-war, Muslim and other social constituencies radicalised by the war.\" In January 2004, it emerged that Galloway would be working with the Socialist Workers Party in England and Wales, and others, under the name Respect \u2013 The Unity Coalition, generally referred to simply as \"Respect\". In the opinion of Nick Cohen of \"The Observer\" it was an \"alliance... between the Trotskyist far left and the Islamic far right.\"\nAfter the 2004 European Parliamentary election results became known, in which Galloway stood in London, but did not gain a seat, he announced that he would stand in East London at the next general election. On 2 December, he confirmed that he was aiming to be nominated as the Respect Party candidate for Bethnal Green and Bow.\nElection campaign.\nThe ensuing electoral campaign in the seat proved to be a difficult one with heated exchanges between Galloway, Oona King (the incumbent Labour MP for Bethnal Green and Bow), and their respective supporters. Galloway and Respect threatened to sue King, whose mother is Jewish, if she repeated her assertion in the \"Evening Standard\" on 10 April 2005 which reported her as saying: \"I have been told by several people that members of Respect have told Muslim voters \"not to vote for me because I am Jewish\"\".\nGalloway was asked at a hustings early in the campaign why he was standing against one of only two Black female MPs to which he replied that King had \"voted to kill a lot of women in the last few years. Many of them had much darker skins than her\". Claiming to be the ghost of Old Labour, Galloway told \"Sunday Times\" contributor A. A. Gill that \"we\u2019re here to haunt new Labour\". Bethnal Green and Bow is \"where Labour was founded. We\u2019re giving birth to the Labour Party all over again\".\nGalloway said at a hustings event that the Labour Government had been pursuing a \"war on Muslims\" while King said her stance against Saddam Hussein had been \"principled\". Galloway received death threats from an offshoot of al-Muhajiroun (a banned extreme Islamist group). On 19 April, about 30 men forced Galloway's meeting with a tenants\u2019 association to be abandoned after claiming he was a \"false prophet\" for encouraging Muslims to vote. Galloway was held by the group for about 20 minutes before the police arrived at the scene. All the major candidates united in condemning the threats and violence. Both the Labour and Respect candidates were given police protection.\nOn 5 May, Galloway gained the seat from the Labour Party with a narrow majority of 823 votes, and denounced the returning officer for alleged discrepancies in the electoral process. After the election result became known, Galloway's spokesman, Ron McKay, rejected claims that King had been racially abused during the campaign and said it was King who had brought up her Jewish background.\nResult and subsequent developments.\nDuring the BBC's election night coverage, Jeremy Paxman asked Galloway about whether he was happy to have removed one of the few black women in parliament, He replied: \"I don't believe that people get elected because of the colour of their skin. I believe that people get elected because of their record and because of their policies\".\nOona King later told BBC Radio 4's \"Today\" programme that she found Paxman's line of questioning inappropriate. Galloway \"shouldn't be barred from running against me because I'm a black woman. ... I was not defined, or did not wish to be defined, by either my ethnicity or religious background\".\nIt emerged in a Channel 4 \"Dispatches\" programme in 2010 that the Islamic Forum of Europe, which advocates sharia law, had been involved in campaigning for Galloway in the Bethnal Green constituency. In a secretly recorded speech at a dinner shortly after his election, Galloway said that the involvement of the IFE had played \"the decisive role\" in his win. Although the IFE itself denied the accusation, Galloway admitted in a statement that the allegation was true.\nThe Respect Party split in the autumn of 2007, with the Socialist Workers' Party and Galloway's wing of Respect blaming each other for what he described as a \"car crash on the left\". Galloway did not seek re-election in Bethnal Green and Bow at the 2010 general election, instead opting to stand in the neighbouring constituency of Poplar and Limehouse. He received 8,160 votes coming third after the Labour and Conservative candidates.\n\"Celebrity Big Brother\".\nIn January 2006, Galloway appeared on the fourth series of the reality TV programme \"Celebrity Big Brother\" for nearly three weeks. During his time on the programme, he mimed licking imaginary milk, whilst pretending to be a cat, from the cupped hands of another housemate, actress Rula Lenska. He wrote later that his activities \"were actually the same stunts that BBC presenters and celebs get up for \"Children in Need\"\".\nGalloway faced a claim at the time from Hilary Armstrong, Labour's Chief Whip, that he should \"respect his constituents, not his ego\". Ron McKay, his spokesman and friend, said of the imaginary milk incident: \"I rather wish he hadn't been given that particularly silly task\". It had been assumed, McKay said, that Galloway's comments about politics would not be cut. Just after his eviction, Galloway told presenter Davina McCall he was positive about having taken part, although when asked if he was \"glad\" to have participated, he said: \"Not after I've seen those press cuttings.\"\nGalloway wrote in a column for \"The Independent\" newspaper in November 2012 writing that his \"antics on \"Big Brother\"\" had \"raised tens of thousands of pounds for the\" Interpal charity and paid for an \"extra caseworker in my constituency\".\nOther developments (2007\u20132011).\nSuspension from the House of Commons (2007).\nOn 17 July 2007, following a four-year inquiry, the House of Commons Select Committee on Standards and Privileges published its sixth report. The Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards, in an addendum to the report, concluded that there was no evidence that Galloway gained any personal benefit from either the former Iraqi administration, or from the Oil-for-Food Programme, but admitted that some documents had been unavailable to him. However, the Committee concluded, in the main body of the report:\nIt found that Galloway's use of parliamentary resources to support his work on the Mariam Appeal \"went beyond what was reasonable\" and \"we recommend that he apologise to the House, and be suspended from its service for a period of 18 actual sitting days.\"\nGalloway's suspension was not intended to be immediate, and he was given the opportunity to defend himself in front of the committee members in the House of Commons on 23 July 2007. During the debate, Galloway repeatedly called into question the motives of the members of the Select Committee, in particular claiming that some of them were members of a political organisation named \"Indict\" and were persecuting him for speaking out against the Iraq War. Speaker Michael Martin warned Galloway that his accusations were not relevant to the matter at hand, but he rejected the warning and responded by saying that Martin would have to order him out of the house if he had any issue with the accusations. Martin therefore named Galloway, leading to the attending members voting to trigger his suspension from parliament that day rather than wait until after the summer recess as had been recommended.\nIsrael and Palestine (2005\u20132011).\nIn an interview with the American radio host and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in September 2005, Galloway said: \"This is the thing about Zionism. It has nothing to do with Jewishness. Some of the biggest Zionists in the world are not Jews. These people have used Jewish people. [...] They created the conditions in the Arab countries and in some European countries to stampede Jewish people out of the countries that they had been living in for many hundreds of years and stampede them into the Zionist state.\"\nDuring an interview for Al Jazeera television on 17 November 2005, he said his election as MP earlier in the year was \"despite all the efforts made by the British government, the Zionist movement and the newspapers and news media which are controlled by Zionism\". In \"Trials of the Diaspora: A History of Anti-Semitism in England\", Anthony Julius cites this interview as one example of Galloway pandering to the antisemitic prejudices of his audience. According to Julius, Galloway merely refers to the \"right-wing press\" in the British media, whereas he has the habit of adding the word \"Zionist\" when speaking on television in the Arab world. A few years later, in a May 2009 speech given at a meeting in Westminster, Galloway said: \"I do not agree with the argument that there is a shadowy Jewish influence. Israel is doing what America wants it to do and to argue otherwise is to go down the dark tunnel of racist antisemitism\".\nAt a 22 July 2006 demonstration (and later in a \"Socialist Worker\" op-ed), Galloway stated that \"Hizbollah has never been a terrorist organisation. It is the legitimate national resistance movement of Lebanon\", on the basis that they are, in his opinion, \"freedom fighters\". In addition: \"I glorify the Hezbollah national resistance movement, and I glorify the leader of Hezbollah, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah\". In 2009, Galloway received a Palestinian passport from Hamas leader Ismail Haniya. Hamas is designated as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the European Union, and the US.\nDuring the 2008\u20132009 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, also known as Operation Cast Lead, Galloway commented in his speech at an event in Trafalgar Square on 3 January 2009: \"Today, the Palestinian people in Gaza are the new Warsaw Ghetto, and those who are murdering them are the equivalent of those who murdered the Jews in Warsaw in 1943\". Jonathan Freedland in \"The Guardian\" thought \"the effect of repeating, again and again, that Israel is a Nazi state\" was, potentially, an incitement to attack Jews because the comparison with Nazis as \"the embodiment of evil\" implies that \"the only appropriate response is hate\". Sigrid Rausing in the \"New Statesman\" wrote: \"The claim of moral equivalence is dangerous, not because it exaggerates the horror of Gaza (the reality of that bombardment was probably worse than we can really imagine), but because it minimises the horror of the Holocaust.\"\n\"Viva Palestina\" aid convoys.\nIn response to the 2008\u201309 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict Galloway instigated the \"Viva Palestina\" aid convoy to the Gaza Strip in January 2009. \"There is a kind of intifada among the youth. They are determined to act\", he told Cole Moreton writing for \"The Independent\", adding, \"We say, 'Don't be lured by the siren voices of separatism and extremism \u2013 join with us and express your anger politically, in a way that will be peaceful, non-violent, and not cost you your life, but will not cost other people their lives either\".\nBy mid-February, the organisation claimed to have raised over \u00a31,000,000 for humanitarian aid in four weeks, although the Charity Commission later found the true figure to be \u00a3180,000. On 14 February 2009, Galloway and hundreds of volunteers launched the convoy comprising approximately 120 vehicles intended for use in the Strip, including a fire engine donated by the Fire Brigades Union (FBU), 12 ambulances, a boat and trucks full of medicines, tools, clothes, blankets and gifts for children. The 5,000-mile route passed through Belgium, France, Spain, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Libya and Egypt.\nThe convoy arrived in Gaza on 9 March, accompanied by approximately 180 extra trucks of aid donated by Libya's Gaddafi Foundation. On 10 March 2009, Galloway announced at a press conference in Gaza City attended by several senior Hamas officials: \"We are giving you now 100 vehicles and all of their contents, and we make no apology for what I am about to say. We are giving them to the elected government of Palestine\", adding that he would personally donate three cars and \u00a325,000 to Hamas organisation \"Prime Minister\" Ismail Haniya.\nOn 8 April 2009, Galloway joined Vietnam War veteran Ron Kovic to launch \"Viva Palestina US\". A third \"Viva Palestina\" convoy began travelling at the end of 2009. On 8 January 2010, Galloway and his colleague Ron McKay were deported from Egypt immediately following their entry from Gaza. They had been attempting to help take about 200 aid trucks into the Gaza Strip. They were driven by the police to the airport and placed on a plane bound for London.\nThe Foreign Ministry of Egypt released a statement reading: \"George Galloway is considered \"persona non grata\" and will not be allowed to enter into Egypt again\". Shortly after his deportation, Galloway said, \"It is a badge of honour to be deported by a dictatorship\" and \"I've been thrown out of better joints than that.\"\nViva Palestina was registered as a charity in April 2009 but, following its continued non-submission of accounts, ceased to be recognised as a charitable organisation in November 2013. It was taken over by the Charity Commission in October 2014, which appointed an accountant to oversee the group because of the concerns over its financial management.\nSupport for the Iranian government.\nGalloway has worked for the Iranian state-run satellite television channel, Press TV since 2008. During an event at the London School of Economics in March 2011, he said: \"Because I don\u2019t believe that the government of Iran is a dictatorship I have no problem about working for Press TV in London which is a British owned television station. I\u2019m not responsible for the government of Ahmedinijad. I\u2019m not responsible for the leadership of Press TV\". Galloway also said: \"There are many things wrong with Iran. One thing they do have is elections. They elected a president that you or I might not have voted for but I am in no doubt that Ahmadinejad won the presidential election\" held in 2009. (See Television presenter below.)\nOn 13 March 2008, Galloway said on \"The Wright Stuff\" chat show that the executed boyfriend of gay Iranian asylum seeker Mehdi Kazemi was executed for \"sex crimes\" rather than for being gay. Galloway also stated on the show that the case of gay rights in Iran was being used by supporters of a war with Iran.\nScott Long, writing in \"The Guardian\" on 31 March, criticised Galloway's claim that \"homosexuals are not executed in Iran, just rapists,\" pointing out that current law in the country stipulates that \"Penetrative sex acts between men can bring death on the first conviction.\" Gay rights activist Peter Tatchell, writing in \"The Guardian\" on 26 March, wrote that Galloway's \"passionate opposition to a war against Iran, which I share, seems to have clouded his judgement\" and \"his claim that lesbian and gay people are not at risk of execution in Iran is refuted by every reputable human rights organisation, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, the International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission and the International Lesbian and Gay Association\".\nIn August 2010, on his Press TV programme \"The Real Deal\", Galloway interviewed President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, following Galloway's participation in a conference for expatriate Iranians whose expenses were paid by Iran's government. Concerning the case of Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian woman convicted of adultery and sentenced to stoning, which he described as \"the so-called stoning case\". Galloway said of Ashtiani's sentence during the interview: \"Every so often an issue comes along which is seized upon by the enemies of Iran and it becomes a heavy problem and magnified...\".\nAccording to Martin Fletcher in \"The Times\", Ahmadinejad gave \"mendacious answers\" which \"went unchallenged by his obsequious interlocutor\". Galloway told Ahmadinejad: \"I have police protection in London from the Iranian opposition because of my support for your election campaign\" in 2009. \"I mention this so you know where I'm coming from.\"\nPolitical career since 2012.\nBradford West by-election, 2012.\nAfter the resignation of Labour MP Marsha Singh due to ill health, Galloway returned to parliament at the March 2012 Bradford West by-election in an unexpected landslide result, with Galloway calling it \"the most sensational victory in British political history.\" His 36% swing, defeating the Labour candidate Imran Hussain, was amongst the largest in modern British political history. Jeremy Corbyn, then a backbench Labour MP, congratulated him in a tweet. Galloway described the result as a \"Bradford spring\" (after the Arab Spring) and said that it showed the \"total rejection\" by voters of the three leading political parties.\nThe election campaign was marked by controversy, in particular over the role of sectarianism, Baradari (clan) networks, and allegations about rivals' lack of \"Islamic values\" Andrew Gilligan noted in \"The Daily Telegraph\" that Galloway had won in wards with a predominantly white electorate as well as those with a majority Muslim population. Nick Robinson, the BBC's political editor, believed it was \"a one-off political coup by a political one-off\" in a seat which has not followed national trends in the past. The novelist Howard Jacobson in \"The Independent\" wrote that Galloway's \"campaign shamelessly courted Muslim prejudice in smaller matters such as alcohol \u2013 where Galloway painted himself as more Muslim than the Muslim Labour candidate whom he accused of liking, shock horror, a tipple.\" Patrick Cockburn in \"The Independent on Sunday\" commented: \"It says something about the comatose nature of British politics that an effective critic of ... failed wars like Mr Galloway, who beats an established party, should be instantly savaged as a self-serving demagogue.\"\nIn October 2013, the \"Total Politics\" magazine published an interview with Galloway in which he admitted: \"I like elections more than I like serving\", and said that he found being an MP was \"2% terrifying, and 98% tedium.\"\nIn late 2013, Galloway became Leader of the Respect Party.\nJulian Assange comments (August 2012).\nGalloway was criticised for comments he made in August 2012 on the legal case involving Wikileaks' Julian Assange in a podcast released on YouTube. Galloway stated that \"I think that Julian Assange's personal sexual behaviour is something sordid, disgusting, and I condemn it.\" Swedish prosecutors wanted to question Assange in relation to the alleged sexual assault of two women, an accusation he has rejected.\nGalloway continued by stating: \"But even taken at its worst, if the allegations made by these two women were true, 100 per cent true, and even if a camera in the room captured them, they don't constitute rape, at least not rape as anyone with any sense can possibly recognise it.\" He also stated that \"not everybody needs to be asked prior to each insertion.\" He continued by saying that the allegations, even if true, \"don't constitute rape\" because initiating sex with someone who is asleep after a sexual encounter the previous night is not rape (one of the women, he said, \"woke up to him [Assange] having sex with her again \u2013 something which can happen, you know\"). Galloway said that Assange's alleged actions amounted to no more than \"bad sexual etiquette\", and he did not believe the women's story anyway.\nAccording to British barrister Felicity Gerry, Galloway's description of rape is not correct under English law. Galloway's comments were criticised by anti-rape campaigners as \"ignorant\", \"very unhelpful\", \"offensive\" and \"deeply concerning.\" Then-Respect Party leader Salma Yaqoob described Galloway's comments as \"deeply disappointing and wrong.\" She subsequently resigned from her post and the party. Yaqoob later stated that having to choose between Galloway's \"anti-imperialist stances\" and standing up for the rights of women was \"a false choice.\"\nGalloway subsequently lost his job as a columnist for \"Holyrood\", a Scottish political magazine, for refusing to apologise for his remarks, and subject to a No platform policy by the National Union of Students.\nIsrael and Zionism (2012\u2013present).\nAbruptly leaves meeting in Oxford, February 2013.\nOn 20 February 2013, Galloway walked out of a publicised debate when he found out that his opponent had Israeli citizenship. The debate, hosted by Oxford University's Christ Church, was on the topic \"Israel should withdraw immediately from the West Bank\". Galloway interrupted his opponent, Eylon Aslan-Levy, a third-year PPE student, to ask whether he was an Israeli. When Aslan-Levy acknowledged his joint British-Israeli nationality, Galloway stood up and stated \"I don't recognize Israel and I don't debate with Israelis\" and left the meeting. Explaining his actions on his Facebook page, Galloway wrote:\nGalloway later claimed on his Twitter feed that he had been \"misled\", writing that \"Christ Church never informed us that the debate would be with an Israeli. Simple.\" The organiser, Mahmood Naji, denied Galloway's allegations in an open letter, explaining: \"At no point during my email exchange with Mr Galloway's secretary was Eylon's nationality ever brought up or mentioned ... nor do I expect to have to tell the speaker what his opponent's nationality is.\"\nGalloway's behaviour was criticised by Julian Huppert, the Liberal Democrat MP for Cambridge, and \"The Times\". The Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) National Committee subsequently released a statement indicating that, while it does support a \"boycott of Israel\", the campaign rejects boycotting an individual \"because she or he happens to be Israeli or because they express certain views.\"\nIn a debate at The Oxford Union the following October, Galloway compared the support of debating Israeli Zionists with that of supporting South African apartheid. Referring indirectly to his encounter with Aslan-Levy, Galloway said that he had worked with Jewish anti-apartheid activists in South Africa, adding \"So Jews don't have to be on the side of apartheid\". These remarks were criticised by Marc Goldberg, writing for \"The Times of Israel\": \"By identifying them as Jews, rather than by their chosen atheist ideology, Galloway makes it clear that the attempt by Jews to shed their Jewish skin and join the global brotherhood of the workers failed. Galloway is praising these people, but he is doing so by holding them up as examples of good Jews that other Jews should emulate, not as anti-apartheid campaigners that everyone should emulate.\"\n\"Israel-free zone\" speech in Leeds, August 2014.\nOn 2 August 2014, during the 2014 Israel\u2013Gaza conflict, Galloway delivered a speech at a public meeting in Leeds. He said:\nGalloway's remarks drew sharp criticism from British politicians and Jewish leaders. Conservative MP and pro-Israel campaigner Robert Halfon described Galloway's words as an \"ill-considered rant that will cause great offence to many\" while adding that \"most Bradford citizens are like British people as a whole: tolerant and decent \u2013 and will ignore Mr Galloway\u2019s demands, treating them with the contempt they deserve.\" Jonathan Arkush, then vice-president of the Board of Deputies of British Jews stated that Galloway \"is so intolerant he can't bear to have someone with an opposing view in his town\".\nDaniel Taub, the Israeli ambassador to the UK, visited Bradford on 18 August in response to an invitation, where he met with local councillors, faith leaders and community representatives. In an interview, Taub commented that his visit was proof that \"the people of Bradford [have] sent a clear message that George Galloway does not represent them.\" Galloway told a reporter from the BuzzFeed website: \"As has just been proved, I cannot make Bradford an Israel-free zone, but I am certain that the Israeli ambassador was not welcome.\" Galloway accused the councillors who had invited the ambassador of fraternising with a \"mouthpiece for murder\".\nWest Yorkshire Police investigated two complaints to determine if Galloway's words constituted hate speech (British law prohibits discrimination based on nationality). Galloway was questioned under caution by the police and the matter was referred to the Crown Prosecution Service. Galloway subsequently criticised the police investigation, describing it as \"an absolute and despicable attempt to curb my freedom of speech\". In October 2014, it emerged that Galloway would not be prosecuted for his comments on the grounds of \"insufficient evidence\", although West Yorkshire Police had \"recorded this matter as a hate incident.\"\nOn 29 August 2014, Galloway was assaulted in Notting Hill by Neil Masterson, a convert to Judaism, and suffered a bruised rib and severe bruising on his head and face. Masterson was charged with religiously aggravated assault and sentenced to 16 months in prison. Released from prison in September 2015, he soon returned to jail for a month after breaking a restraining order forbidding him from contacting Galloway. Masterson was also fined for harassment.\nOn 13 October 2014, Galloway abstained from a vote in the House of Commons formally recognising Palestine because the motion included the recognition of Israel as well. On the Respect website he advocated a one-state solution.\nAlleged defamation.\nOn 5 February 2015, Galloway appeared on BBC's \"Question Time\" discussion programme, recorded in Finchley, London, within a constituency with Britain's largest Jewish community. Galloway's appearance on this edition of the programme was the subject of much media coverage at the time because of his anti-Israel attitude. Part of the debate discussed antisemitism and Galloway strongly objected to the insinuation that he holds anti-semitic views. (In 2008, Galloway said \"the slur\" was \"categorically crushed\" after he won a libel action against the Jewish station Jcom Radio following the broadcast of a parody of him shouting \"Kill the Jews, Kill the Jews\".) Five days later, Hadley Freeman, a columnist for \"The Guardian\", tweeted: \"Galloway has said and done things that cross the line from anti-Israel to antisemitic\".\nGalloway said that he would issue a suit for defamation against her. Some who had re-tweeted Freeman's comment were then sent a letter from Chambers Solicitors, acting for Galloway, asking for an apology and \u00a35,000 plus Value Added Tax (then levied at 20%) to cover costs incurred by the letter. The Solicitors Regulation Authority, which looks into professional malpractice, was aware of the issue by early March 2015. Eric Heinze, Professor of Law at Queen Mary University of London, noted that an editor of the Media Lens website had sent a tweet to Freeman asking if she could provide evidence for her claim that Galloway is antisemitic. Heinze wrote that \"any example she could cite would probably persuade some and not others. Even if an overwhelming majority were unpersuaded, a highly popular opinion does not create an objectively verifiable fact.\" Chambers Solicitors' conduct was the subject of a warning from the SRA a year later. Initiating a libel action must begin within a year and no formal writ was issued.\n2015 general election.\nDuring a hustings meeting in Galloway's Bradford West constituency on 8 April during the 2015 general election heated exchanges occurred between Galloway and the Labour candidate, Naz Shah. Galloway accused her of lying about her forced marriage which had been the subject of an open letter written by Shah and released to the media after her selection as a candidate. He said Shah was in error in claiming she was \"subject to a forced marriage at the age of 15. But you were not 15. You were 16-and-a-half\". He then produced what he said was her \"nikah\", a Muslim marriage certificate.\nShah alleged at the event that Galloway's representative in Pakistan impersonated her deceased father to acquire the \"nikah\". Ron McKay, Galloway's spokesman, said that there was no dishonesty in gaining access to the document via an intermediary in Pakistan. Labour supplied media outlets with a copy of Shah's \"nikah\" which confirms that she was 15 at the time of her forced marriage. By her own account, Shah was raped during the marriage, but in an email to Helen Pidd, \"The Guardian\"s northern editor, McKay disputed whether it had been a forced marriage at all.\nGalloway accused Shah of favouring Israel. At one point during the campaign, Galloway tweeted a picture of Israelis waving Israeli flags with the caption \"Thank you for electing Naz Shah\". The image was juxtaposed with another, showing Palestinians celebrating his own supposedly imminent victory. Shah said she has participated in marches supporting the Palestinian cause.\nGalloway was defeated at the 2015 general election. Naz Shah won a majority of 11,420 votes over him, reversing the majority of 10,000 votes he had gained at the by-election three years earlier.\nOn 10 May 2015, Galloway announced an intention to challenge the result, alleging that false statements and malpractice related to postal votes during the campaign meant that the result of the election should be set aside, but did not do so. The Fawcett Society expressed concern that \"the continued opposition of the unsuccessful Respect Party candidate George Galloway, to Shah's election is the culmination of a sexist electoral campaign by Galloway\". In July 2015, Jeremy Corbyn said he thought \"...the tactics he used against our candidate, were appalling. I was quite shocked; it was appalling.\"\nIt emerged in January 2017 that Galloway's reimbursed expense claim for the rent of his constituency office in Bradford West has been forwarded by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) to the Metropolitan Police, which was then at the early assessment stage.\nLondon mayoral campaign (2015\u201316).\nDuring his unsuccessful 2015 general election campaign to be re-elected for Bradford West, Galloway announced that he would stand in the election for London mayor in 2016 if he lost, an intention he confirmed on Twitter on 28 May.\nDave Hill, writing for \"The Guardian\" in November 2015, accused Galloway of making \"cutting personal attacks\" about the Labour candidate Sadiq Khan, a Muslim whom \"Galloway [...] appears to consider [...] an inadequate practitioner of his faith\" (a reference to Galloway's remark that Khan held the Quran in his left, not right, hand, and it \"wasn\u2019t missed by people who care about these things\"). In the final result, Galloway came seventh with 37,007 (1.4%) first preference votes. After second preference were accounted for, Sadiq Khan became mayor of London.\nOther developments (2015\u2013present).\nIn July 2015, Galloway endorsed Jeremy Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He tweeted: \"Congratulations to Jeremy Corbyn MP and good fortune in the labour leadership contest. If he wins it will change everything...\" He also said that he would become a Labour Party member \"pretty damn quick\" if Corbyn was elected as Labour leader. Less than a week after Corbyn became leader, a Labour spokeswoman told \"The Times\": \"George Galloway has not applied to rejoin the Labour party and he will not be receiving an invitation.\" Corbyn himself said in July 2015 during an interview with \"New Statesman\" editor Jason Cowley that he was appalled at the tactics Galloway used while defending his seat against Naz Shah (Labour) during the general election. In an interview to \"The Huffington Post\" journalist Paul Waugh in December 2015, Corbyn said that Galloway's readmission to the party was a decision not within his powers.\nFollowing Ken Livingstone's much criticised comments in late April 2016 concerning Adolf Hitler and Zionism, Galloway supported Livingstone's argument. Galloway disputed that Livingstone's comments were antisemitic. \"The Israel lobby has just destroyed the Labour Party\", he tweeted in May 2016. \"It is an amazing achievement\".\nIn July 2016, Galloway endorsed Corbyn's campaign in the Labour Party leadership election. He said: \"If Corbyn wins a big victory \u2013 and I think he will \u2013 then that should be, and it's important that it is, the final burial of Blair and Blairism.\"\nThe Respect Party \"voluntarily deregistered\" from the Electoral Commission on 18 August 2016.\nIt was announced on 21 March 2017 that Galloway was standing as an independent candidate at the Manchester Gorton by-election set for 4 May, following the death of Sir Gerald Kaufman in February. Gorton had been one of Labour's safest seats at the 2015 general election. The by-election was cancelled following the announcement of the 2017 snap general election being held on 8 June. Galloway subsequently transferred his candidacy to the general election. At the election, Labour easily retained the seat; Galloway came a distant third with 5.7% of the vote.\nMeanwhile, on 20 June 2016, Galloway lost a libel action brought by Aisha Ali-Khan, his assistant for six months in 2012. He had claimed that she had pursued a \"dirty tricks\" campaign against him and the Respect Party, and had slept at his house with her then-husband. The case was heard in the High Court. His counsel apologised on Galloway's behalf, and accepted that he had made \"defamatory accusations\". Ali-Khan will receive a \"five-figure sum\" in damages and her legal costs.\nAs part of the settlement of their libel claim, both Galloway and Ali-Khan gave undertakings not to make any further public statement about the litigation or to defame each other. In 2018 Galloway brought an action that Ali-Khan had breached this undertaking 26 times, which Ali-Khan admitted, and in April 2018 the High Court imprisoned Ali-Khan for 12 weeks for contempt of court, describing her action as \"deliberate, flagrant, persistent and inexcusable\". Ali-Khan had been found guilty of contempt of court on a previous occasion. Previously, during 2017, Ali-Khan had filed a petition for Galloway's bankruptcy.\nIn the 2019 general election, Galloway contested the Parliamentary seat of West Bromwich East as an independent, describing himself as supportive of Corbyn's leadership but also supportive of Brexit. He came 6th with 489 votes.\nOn 14 December, Galloway launched the Workers Party of Britain, which describes itself as \"economically radical with an independent foreign policy\" and \"unequivocally committed to class politics\". Galloway is the party's leader.\nOn 16 November 2020 Galloway announced his intention to stand in the expected by-election in Rutherglen and Hamilton West, after sitting MP Margaret Ferrier was accused of breaching COVID-19 regulations, for which she faces a possible recall petition.\nHe led All for Unity in the 2021 Scottish Parliament election and announced his intention to vote for the Conservative Party on the constituency vote, and for his own party on the list vote. This contradicted several other occasions in which he said voting Conservative was something he would never even consider. All for Unity received 23,299 votes in the election, or 0.9%, placing the party 7th nationally and giving them zero seats.\nOn 27 May 2021, Galloway announced his intention to stand for the 2021 Batley and Spen by-election. Galloway came third with 21.8% of the vote, and said he would challenge the outcome of the election in court, as he said lies were told about him during the election campaign.\nOther domestic and international issues.\nSyria.\nSupport for Bashar al-Assad.\nGalloway expressed support for the Syrian presence in Lebanon five months before it ended, telling the Lebanese \"Daily Star\" in August 2008: \"Syrian troops in Lebanon maintain stability and protect the country from Israel\". In the same article he expressed his opposition to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1559, which urged the Lebanese Government to establish control over all its territory. When Syria did withdraw from Lebanon, Galloway objected and said the neighbouring states presence had been entirely \"legal\"; Christopher Hitchens, citing the Taif Accords of 1989, disputed his comment.\nOf Bashar al-Assad, and the country he leads, he said during a visit to the University of Damascus in November 2005: \"For me he is the last Arab ruler, and Syria is the last Arab country. It is the fortress of the remaining dignity of the Arabs\". He also called Assad a \"breath of fresh air\".\nGalloway again praised the government of Assad in a leaked 2010 email to Assad's advisor Bouthaina Shaaban when asking for help in a Viva Palestina convoy and reminded her of previous help from the Syrian government for the campaign. In the correspondence, leaked by the Anonymous hacking group, she responded: \"God bless your amazing efforts and I will be honoured to be part and parcel of it\". \"I knew that I could rely on you and the last Arab country in this historic endeavour\", he wrote in response.\nGalloway said in a July 2011 interview on Hezbollah's Al-Manar station: \"Bashar Assad wants reform and change, to realise the aspirations of his people\". In the early stages of the Civil War (when Assad was reported as \"perpetrating massacres of his own people\"), opponents were \"trying to pressure Syria and President Assad because of the good things that he did, such as supporting Palestinian and Lebanese resistance and rejecting to surrender to Israel\".\nSyrian civil war (2011\u2013present).\nA month later, in an August 2011 piece for the Al Jazeera website, Galloway wrote he \"was never close to the Syrian regime\" and acknowledged its \"authoritarian character, its police state mentality\", and the \"rampant\" corruption \"much of it concentrated around his [Assad's] own family\". \"I fully support the Syrian revolution\", Galloway told Christopher Silvester in November 2012. \"I want to see the end of all the dictatorships in the Middle East and I hope that it can be achieved peacefully. But if peaceful change is not possible, then violent change is inevitable. I wholly support the Syrian people's demands for democratic government. I just don't support armed intervention in Syria, any more than I supported it in any other country in the region\".\nIn January 2013, Galloway criticised David Cameron's government for arming Syrian rebels linked to Salafi jihadism. Following the Ghouta chemical attack on 21 August 2013, Galloway speculated on his Press TV show that the responsibility for the atrocity lay with al-Qaeda and the rebels in Syria who had been provided with the weapons by Israel. During his speech in the House of Commons debate about the crisis in Syria on 29 August 2013, Galloway was asked about this broadcast by the Conservative MP Matthew Offord. In response, he stated that he had \"said no such thing\", and was accused of lying. In the debate Galloway had stated \"It is not that the regime is not bad enough to do it; everybody knows that it is bad enough to do it. The question is: is it mad enough to do it?\".\nIn a House of Commons debate on 26 September 2014 he opposed military action by the west against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) insurgency group, which he called a \"death cult\", and instead advocated military action from the regional powers.\nGalloway told \"Prospect\" magazine in February 2016: \"I support the decision of the Russian government to come to the aid of the government in Syria because whatever faults it [the Syrian government] may have, whatever crimes it has committed, they are considerably fewer than the crimes committed by IS or would be committed by IS were they to come to power\".\nLatin America.\nHe has been an advocate for the Venezuelan government of Hugo Ch\u00e1vez and, in his \"Fidel Castro Handbook\", for the former Cuban leader. \"You were the greatest man I ever met Comandante Fidel\", he tweeted when Castro died in November 2016.\nScotland and the UK.\nGalloway has long supported devolution for Scotland, but opposes Scottish independence. In the run-up to the Scottish independence referendum, held on 18 September 2014, Galloway was dismissive of the official Better Together campaign because it also involved Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, and he believed its leader, Alistair Darling, to be ineffective. \"My case isn't that Scotland couldn't be independent, but shouldn't\", \"The Sunday Times\" quoted him as saying.\nGalloway's argument against independence was based on a defence of \"class\" over \"nationality\". He told Serena Kutchinsky in an interview for \"Prospect\" magazine: \"If we lose this vote the possibility of a real Labour government, or any kind of Labour government, in the rest of UK will be gone\". He has, however, argued in favour of greater Scottish devolution.\nIn 2013, Galloway began a series of public meetings in Scotland using the slogan of \"Just Say Naw.\" On 11 September 2014, Galloway took part in \"\", an independence debate held in Glasgow and broadcast by the BBC during the evening.\nIn July 2020, Galloway co-founded and established a cross-party Scottish unionist political organisation and political coalition called Alliance 4 Unity (later re-named All for Unity), and its goal is to try of taking down the Scottish National Party and Scottish nationalism in general for the 2021 Scottish Parliament election, by tactically vote for any Scottish unionist candidates in second place on each Scottish electoral regions.\nSaudi Arabia.\nGalloway has criticised Britain's close ties with Saudi Arabia and British involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. In 2017, he said: \"It is a country with no democracy or freedom of any kind. It is a country that exports terrorism around the world and funds terrorism and extremism around the world. We should have nothing whatsoever to do with them.\"\nIndia.\nGalloway said the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi \"has blood on his hands\". Modi was accused of initiating and condoning the 2002 Gujarat riots against India's Muslim minority.\nEuropean Union.\nAt a rally at the Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre on 19 February 2016, Galloway endorsed the Grassroots Out (GO) campaign which advocated the \"Leave\" option in the European Union membership referendum. He was introduced by UKIP leader Nigel Farage as a \"special guest\" who is \"without doubt one of the greatest orators in this country, he is a towering figure on the left of British politics\". Galloway's presence at the rally prompted some of those present to leave. Labour MP Kate Hoey, who was involved with GO, defended Galloway's participation. \"George ended up getting a hugely favourable response to what he said\". Responding to criticism of his association with Farage, Galloway tweeted: \"We are not pals. We are allies in one cause. Like Churchill and Stalin\".\nOn 17 April 2019 Galloway announced he would support the Brexit Party led by Nigel Farage in the May 2019 European Parliament election. In an announcement on Twitter, he said that \"given the nature of Labour's Euro-fanatic candidates list and the crucial juncture we have reached in the fight for the full implementation of the Brexit referendum result and for one-time only I will be supporting Nigel Farage in next months elections.\"\nTelevision presenter.\nIn August 2009, editions of Galloway's programmes \"The Real Deal\" and \"Comment\" programme for Press TV, a London-based news channel controlled by the government of Iran, were found by the British broadcasting regulator Ofcom to have breached its broadcasting code on impartiality.\nAfter Press TV lost its Ofcom licence in 2012, according to Galloway, the Iranian broadcaster owed him \u00a340,000, leading to his company Miranda Media entering compulsory liquidation in 2013 because of unpaid tax. Reportedly, the owed payment amounts to \u00a3100,000, although Galloway disputed this in February 2016. Miranda Media, in which income from Galloway's media work was deposited, was established in September 2007 under a month before a law came into force allowing directors to receive loans from their own companies, a facility Galloway used on multiple occasions.\nShortly after its foundation in June 2012, Galloway became a presenter with the Al Mayadeen television station where he presents \"Kalima Hurra\" ( meaning free word). Al Mayadeen reportedly has connections with Iran and the Assad government in Syria, and has been accused of supporting the Assad government, a claim Galloway has rejected.\nIn November 2013, Galloway and his wife Gayatri began to present \"Sputnik\" for the RT network, a Russian government-backed station formerly known as Russia Today. He is a regular contributor to RT's other programming. Among the notable guests on Galloway's RT programmes have been Gilad Atzmon, and Shlomo Sand.\nIn an overview of the broadcasting organisations Galloway works for, Tom Rogan in the \"National Review\" in April 2014 described him as being \"a Western puppet for tyranny's propagandists\". In the register of members' financial interests published at the end of January 2015, Galloway disclosed that he had earned \u00a3293,450 from his television broadcasting in the previous year and had received almost \u00a370,000 in travelling expenses and hotel stays. For the period November 2013 to February 2015, Galloway was paid \u00a3100,000 for his appearances on RT, the highest payment to any British politician working for the channel.\nRadio presenter.\nGalloway began to broadcast on talkRADIO (which launched in March 2016 as a sister station to Talksport) in June 2016. Amongst his many monologues, he said that if Scotland were to leave the UK and join the EU \"it would not be a good thing for his fellow countrymen\", and has condemned the BBC as a \"national disgrace\".\nConcerning the Iraq War, he said he would not rest \"until Tony Blair is brought to justice\", and in 2019 announced plans to try and prosecute Alastair Campbell.\nIn June 2019, after Liverpool Football Club had defeated Tottenham Hotspur Football Club in the Champions League final, Galloway congratulated the people of Liverpool and tweeted \"No #Isra\u00ebl flags on the Cup!\". He said that this referred to a number of Tottenham fans who were flying the flag of Israel in the crowd, showing \"an affiliation to a 'racist state'\". Tottenham Hotspur accused Galloway of \"blatant anti-Semitism\" and talkRADIO sacked him saying the broadcaster \"does not tolerate anti-Semitic views\".\nPersonal life.\nMarriages and children.\nGalloway has been married four times.\nIn 1979, he married Elaine Fyffe, with whom he has a daughter, Lucy (born 1982). The couple separated in 1987 and divorced in 1999.\nIn 1994, Galloway married Dr Amineh Abu-Zayyad, a biologist of Palestinian origin, in a non-legally binding Islamic ceremony; a legally binding civil ceremony followed in March 2000. Abu-Zayyad was granted a divorce in February 2009, after an estrangement of several years, on the grounds of \"unreasonable behaviour\"; her petition was not contested.\nGalloway married Rima Husseini, his former researcher, in a non-legally binding Islamic ceremony in 2005. Galloway had two sons, Zein (born 2007) and Faris (born 2011), with Husseini, who is from Lebanon.\nOn 31 March 2012, he married his fourth wife, Indonesian anthropologist Putri Gayatri Pertiwi, in an Islamic ceremony in Amsterdam. The initial event was followed by a traditional Javanese wedding ceremony in Sumatra and a civil marriage at the House of Commons in September 2012. Pertiwi works as a consultant for a Dutch research firm and as a co-presenter of Galloway's TV show \"Sputnik\". The couple have three children: a son, Toren Mustaqim, born on 15 July 2014; a daughter, Orl\u00e1 Dhien, born in 2017; and another daughter, \u00d2ban Amaria, born in August 2020.\nReligion.\nGalloway has been outspoken in support of religious liberties. Though he has long stated that his religious beliefs are a private matter, Galloway was raised and still identifies as a Roman Catholic. In a 2013 interview, Galloway sparked controversy for saying as a Roman Catholic, he would not feel safe in an independent Scotland given the historically bigoted views harboured by many Scottish nationalists towards Catholics.\nGalloway has hired Muslims to fill prominent positions on his staff. At a 2012 rally he said \u201cWe stand for justice and \"haqq\"\" and \"A Muslim is somebody who is not afraid of earthly power but who fears only the Judgment Day. I\u2019m ready for that, I\u2019m working for that and it's the only thing I fear.\" Galloway\u2018s current wife is Muslim, as were two of his previous spouses. Galloway was married in an Islamic ceremony. According to Jemima Khan, writing for the \"New Statesman\" in April 2012, Galloway converted to Islam around 2000; his \"shahadah\" was performed in Kilburn, London, in the presence of members of the Muslim Association of Great Britain. Khan claims that while Galloway has informed \"those close to him\", he chose not to disclose his conversion to the public. Galloway said that the \"shahadah\" had not taken place: \"I have never attended any such ceremony in Kilburn, Karachi or Kathmandu. It is simply and categorically untrue.\" He went on to reiterate his position that religious beliefs are a \"personal matter\"."}

Known for his work in experimental theater and his Postmodernist contributions to Romanian literature, he is a member of the Writers' Union of Romania (USR), its public relations executive and the head of its Bucharest chapter. Also recognized for his contribution to Romanian humor and his essays, he has published regularly in journals such as \"Contemporanul\", \"Luceaf\u0103rul\", \"Ramuri\" and \"S\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2na Financiar\u0103\". His career in the media also covers screenwriting for Romanian television stations and the popularization of contract bridge. The author of several scientific works on engineering, G\u00e2rbea is also a faculty member at the University of Agronomical Sciences and Veterinary Medicine.\nThe recipient of several national awards for literature, he received critical attention for plays, short stories and novels which merge intertextuality and parody with neorealistic elements. In his work for the Romanian stage, G\u00e2rbea has primarily reworked motifs from Anton Chekhov, Ion Luca Caragiale, Gustave Flaubert, Costache Negruzzi and various other of his predecessors, addressing contemporary realities. He is also the other of tragicomedies with themes borrowed the 1989 Revolution and his country's post-1989 history. The latter focus is complemented by his works in novel and short prose, which often take the form of political fiction or satire aimed at his writer colleagues. Such contributions have consolidated G\u00e2rbea's success with the general public, but have divided critical opinion on the issue of their ultimate literary value.\nBiography.\nEarly life and career.\nBorn in Bucharest, Horia G\u00e2rbea is the grandson of Titus G\u00e2rbea, a Land Forces general and diplomat of the Romanian Kingdom. He recalls that his grandfather's passion for literature was passed onto him from an early age, when he first heard him reciting poems by Dante Aligheri. The future writer attended the Mihai Viteazul High School, opting for a sciences-based curriculum, but envisioned becoming a writer. At around age 17, as one of the adolescent guests on a Romanian Television talk show hosted by author Mircea S\u00eentimbreanu, he stated his intention of having two books published by the year 2000 (he recalls: \"[S\u00eentimbreanu], who was a witty but skeptical man, did not encourage me\").\nG\u00e2rbea made his debut in 1982, at age twenty, his poems being published by the student magazine \"Amfiteatru\". He graduated from the Agronomical Science University's Department of Landscaping and Environmental Engineering (1986). A member of the teaching staff at his \"alma mater\" since 1987, he received a Doctor of Science diploma from the Politehnica University in 1999. A regular of \"Cenaclul de luni\" (\"The Monday Literary Club\"), founded by literary critic Nicolae Manolescu and journalist Radu C\u0103lin Cristea, G\u00e2rbea later moved on to the \"Universitas\" circle, founded and led by critic Mircea Martin. His early poetry was awarded a 1986 prize by Spain's University of Bilbao (1986).\nA turning point in Horia G\u00e2rbea's writing career was the Romanian Revolution of 1989, which put an end to the communist regime. In 1990, one of his first works in drama, translated into English as \"The Serpent\", was performed by the British Royal Court Theatre. A year later, \"Pesc\u0103ru\u015ful din livada cu vi\u015fini\" (\"The Seagull in the Cherry Orchard\") was first staged at the Victor Ion Popa Theater, followed in 1992 by the premiere of \"Func\u0163ionarul destinului\" (\"The Clerk of Destiny\") with the Bucharest experimental theater company Inoportun. He made his editorial debut in the genre with the 1993 volumes \"Doamna Bovary s\u00eent ceilal\u0163i\" (\"Madame Bovary Are the Others\") and \"Mephisto\" (a Romanian-language variant of Klaus Mann's 1936 novel). Another one of his plays, \"St\u0103p\u00e2nul t\u0103cerii\" (\"The Master of Silence\"), was staged in 1994 by Pite\u015fti's Alexandru Davila Theater.\nG\u00e2rbea's first volume of lyric poetry, (\"Biographical Text\"), saw print in 1996, earning him an award granted by the Sighet Poetry Festival. Also that year, the writer followed up with a second collection of poems, \"Proba cu martori\" (\"The Confrontation of Witnesses\"), which was awarded the yearly prize of the Bucharest Association of Writers (a section of the USR). In 1996, he wrote the script for \"Ils emm\u00e9nagement\" (\"They Are Moving On\"), a French-language street theater performance, which premiered in France. \"Proba cu martori\" was followed in 1997 by the short story volume \"Misterele Bucure\u0219tilor\" (\"The Mysteries of Bucharest\") and the multiple award-winning novel \"C\u0103derea Bastiliei\" (Romanian for \"Fall of the Bastille\").\nG\u00e2rbea returned to drama with the 1999 book \"Decembrie, \u00een direct\" (\"December, Live Broadcast\"). It received the Writers' Union Prize for Theater. The student theater company Calandrinon featured his \"C\u0103r\u0163ile\" (\"The Books\") in its 2000 program, and the Toma Caragiu Theater in Ploie\u015fti did the same with \"Cafeaua domnului Ministru\" (\"The Minister's Coffee\"). In 2001, he published an anthology of texts for the stage: titled \"Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?\" (\"Who Killed Marx?\"), it was a recipient of the Romanian Academy's Ion Luca Caragiale Award with a three-year delay. Also in 2001, his short story collection (\"Enigmas in Our City\") saw print. These were followed the next year by \"Ra\u0163\u0103 cu portocale\" (\"Duck \u00e0 l'Orange\"), a volume of essays, and, in 2003, by two other books: \"Vacan\u0163\u0103 \u00een infern\" (\"A Holiday in Hell\"; literary criticism, 2 vols.) and \"Cre\u015fterea iguanelor de cas\u0103\" (\"Raising Pet Iguanas\"; poetry). The former was shortlisted for the USR Award.\nHis career in the post-Revolution press began early in 1990, when he was among the writers published by \"Nou\u0103zeci\", a magazine founded by Lauren\u0163iu Ulici, Cristian Popescu and C\u0103t\u0103lin \u0162\u00e2rlea. Active as a theater critic and chronicler, as well as a contract bridge popularizer, he later had permanent columns in \"Luceaf\u0103rul\" (1990\u20131995, and again 1998\u20132001), \"ArtPanorama\" (1997\u20131998), \"Scena\" (1998\u20132001), \"Monitorul de Ia\u015fi\" (1998\u20131999), \"Contemporanul\" (1999\u20132001), \"S\u0103pt\u0103m\u00e2na Financiar\u0103\" (after 2005) and the Craiova-based literary magazine \"Ramuri\". His articles were also published by other venues, among them \"Convorbiri Literare\", \"Cuv\u00e2ntul\", \"Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103\" and \"Ziarul Financiar\". In 2001, he joined the editorial staff of \"Okean\", a specialized magazine co-founded by three Romanian theater companies: Bulandra, Nottara, Odeon and the National Theater Cluj-Napoca. He was also among the first Romanian authors to publish fiction in the new wave of lifestyle magazines, being an early contributor to the local version of \"Playboy\" (together with George Cu\u015fnarencu, R\u0103zvan Petrescu and Jean Lorin Sterian). Between 2002 and 2003, he published several works related to his field of expertise in engineering: (\"Structures and Constructions with Dynamic Insulation\", 2002), \"Structuri \u015fi construc\u0163ii \u2013 no\u0163iuni \u015fi calcule de fiabilitate\" (\"Structures and Constructions\u2014Notions and Calculations in Reliability\", 2002), \"Structuri \u015fi construc\u0163ii \u2013 curs universitar\" (\"Structures and Constructions\u2014University Lecture\", 2003; revised edition 2004).\nLiterary consecration and Writers' Union activities.\nAn active member of the Writers' Union since 1994, Horia G\u00e2rbea was elected president of its Bucharest chapter in 2003, and appointed head of the Union's public relations branch two years later. As a representative of the Bucharest section, he worked closely with Editura Nou\u0103 publishing house in helping to popularize the writings of his fellow association members. Having joined the UNITER association of theatrical professionals in 1993, he also works as a dramaturge, and has first been employed as such by the Toma Caragiu Theater since 1998. His contributions in this field include translations and adaptations of plays by Anton Chekhov (\"The Cherry Orchard\"), Pierre Corneille (\"L'Illusion comique\"), Dario Fo (\"We Won't Pay! We Won't Pay!\"), Pierre de Marivaux (\"Le Triomphe de l'amour\"), Moli\u00e8re (\"The School for Wives\"), Ayn Rand (\"Night of January 16th\"), Fernando Arrabal, Jacques Copi, Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, John D. MacDonald, Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, G\u00e9rald Sibleyras, Tennessee Williams and Stanis\u0142aw Ignacy Witkiewicz. In 1998, G\u00e2rbea also began working in screenwriting, collaborating with several national television stations. He was first employed by Pro TV from 1998 to 2001, working on the variety show \"Ministerul Comediei\" and the sitcom \"La Bloc\". He was then affiliated with Prima TV, writing for Romic\u0103 \u0162ociu and Cornel Palade's \"Alomania\" sketch comedy show, and later Na\u0163ional TV, where he contributed to a similar production, \"Na\u0163ionala de bere\". In 2001, G\u00e2rbea was also involved in writing for Antena 1's sitcom \"Clanul Pope\u015ftilor\". Between 2002 and 2003, he worked with the public broadcaster TVR Cultural, where he hosted a talk show on cultural issues.\nDuring 2004, authors Horia G\u00e2rbea, Valeriu Butulescu, Mircea Ghi\u0163ulescu and Mircea Petean traveled to Vietnam, on the invitation of the Vietnamese Writers Union. Their experience in the Far East produced the collective travel account \"Drumul spre Nghe An\" (\"The Road to Nghe An\"), published the same year. Also in 2004, G\u00e2rbea premiered his \"Cleopatra a \u015faptea\" (\"Cleopatra VII\") with the Andrei Mure\u015fanu company of Sf\u00e2ntu Gheorghe, published a new work for the stage\u2014\"Hotel Cervantes\", and oversaw the publishing of Editura Limes' \"Repeti\u0163ie f\u0103r\u0103 orchestr\u0103\" (\"Rehearsal without an Orchestra\"), an anthology of prose pieces by young Romanian authors. His own work also included the 2005 essay collections \"Arte par\u0163iale\" (\"Partial Arts\") and \"Bridge \u00een 41 de povestiri vesele\" (\"Contract Bridge in 41 Cheerful Stories\"). G\u00e2rbea was made Knight of \"Meritul Cultural\" order through a 2004 presidential decree. In March 2005, as head of the Bucharest Association of Writers, he set up the Romanian version of France's literary festival \"Le Printemps des Po\u00e8tes\" (\"Poets' Spring\", known locally as \"Prim\u0103vara poe\u0163ilor\"). A month later, during the \"Romanian Comedy Festival\", his play \"Leonida XXI\" was staged by the Comedy Theater.\nAlso in 2005, G\u00e2rbea and the Writers' Union were involved in a polemic with Paul Goma, a novelist and former dissident who lives in France. This came after \"Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\", a literary magazine managed by the Union, republished fragments from Goma's diary, which caused public outrage for its perceived antisemitism. G\u00e2rbea and USR president Nicolae Manolescu both intervened to sanction the publication. In an early interview with \"Gardianul\" daily, he spoke of the editorial staff as having displayed \"negligence\", and noted that replacing the panel of editors was one of the sanctions being considered, while also stating that he felt none of them were \"100% responsible\" for the incident. G\u00e2rbea however dismissed rumors that he and his colleagues were considering disestablishing \"Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\", noting that the magazine was a historical institution.\nThe USR's public expression of regret over having tolerated \"a text with antisemitic content\" caused Goma to threaten with a lawsuit on libel grounds. In reaction, G\u00e2rbea stated: \"What we are interested in is \"Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\", a press organ edited by the USR. Paul Goma may believe whatever he likes. It is not him that we are discussing, but the magazine. I see no reason why he would sue me personally.\" According to an overview of the episode by journalist Ovidiu \u015eimonca, Horia G\u00e2rbea had unwittingly prompted Goma to state his intention of suing the Jewish-Romanian community league, or Federation of Jewish Communities of Romania (FCER). This was because, during the scandal, G\u00e2rbea had explained that the FCER's reaction was an incentive in the USR's internal investigation. Goma's claim for reparations from FCER leaders, \u015eimonca noted, ignored the fact that G\u00e2rbea had not disclosed any names.\nSince 2006.\nG\u00e2rbea published his second novel, \"Crime la Elsinore\" (\"Murders at Helsing\u00f8r\"), in 2006. Printed the same year, his new drama volume, \"Divor\u0163 \u00een direct\" (\"Live Divorce\"), was nominated for another USR award. In late 2007, he participated with fellow writers Doina Ru\u015fti and Liviu Ioan Stoiciu in a children's literature project initiated by Editura Paralela 45, which involved rewriting a series of fairy tales in Romanian folklore and Christian mythology. Titled \"Basme \u015fi pove\u015fti mistice rom\u00e2ne\u015fti repovestite\" (\"Retold Romanian Fairy Tales and Mystical Stories\"), it was illustrated with reproductions of children-made Romanian icons. His son, Tudor, was born in the same year.\nWith the 2008 \"Trecute Vie\u0163i de Fan\u0163i \u015fi de Birlici\" (\"Bygone Lives of Beaus and Aces\"), he investigated the history of Romanian literature by focusing on and inventorying literary types. In spring, he participated in the project \"Scriitori pe calea regal\u0103\" (\"Writers on the Royal Road\"), organized by the former King of Romania Michael I, the Royal House, the USR and various other venues for the benefit of award-winning writers. He was also the USR's envoy to the Three Seas Writers and Translators Committee conference on Rhodes, Greece.\nThe same year, G\u00e2rbea voluntarily reduced his contributions to drama and theater criticism, citing his family obligations, alongside a general disappointment with the milieu: \"I grew aware that writing for the theater is usually not followed by productions. Although plays I signed were constantly performed, I never had productions at a satisfactory level nor significant material gains, except for translations.\" Instead, he focused on writing a fantasy novel for the youth, \"F\u0103t Frumos din lun\u0103\" (\"\"F\u0103t Frumos\" from the Moon\") and a cycle of poems known as \"C\u00e2ntecele lui Huppy\" (\"Huppy's Songs\"), as well as on reviewing for publishing the memoirs of his grandfather Titus G\u00e2rbea. Working with Editura Tritonic publishing house, G\u00e2rbea also coordinated an anthology of political fiction, in which he included his own novella \"Detestarea na\u0163iunii\" (\"Detesting the Nation\").\nIn 2010, Editura Limes published \"Fratele mai de\u015ftept al lui Kala\u015fnikov\" (\"Kalashnikov's Smarter Brother\"), his new volume of short prose. The same year, G\u00e2rbea visited Azerbaijan, invited by the Heydar Aliyev Foundation, and published some of his impressions in \"Revista 22\". His larger travel writing, published by the same foundation as \"Azerbaijan \u2013 The Living Flame\" (in English, Romanian, German), was officially launched at the Frankfurt Book Fair (October 2010). In April 2011, G\u00e2rbea and fellow writer Ruxandra Cesereanu were in Israel, attending the Nisan Poetry Festival in Maghar.\nWork.\nCultural context and Postmodernist reinterpretations.\nCommitted to Postmodernism, G\u00e2rbea debuted as a member of the \"Optzeci\u015fti\" group of writers, most of whom reached their creative peak after 1980: together with Mircea C\u0103rt\u0103rescu, Traian T. Co\u015fovei, Florin Iaru, Doru Mare\u015f, Radu G. \u0162eposu and Ion Stratan, he was part of the \"Optzeci\u015fti\" nucleus inside \"Cenaclul de luni\". Given his relatively late consecration, G\u00e2rbea is nevertheless identified with the 1990s generation of post-\"Optzeci\u015fti\". This also reflects G\u00e2rbea's own positioning: according to his own statement, the move from one generation group to the other coincided with his leaving \"Cenaclul de luni\" and joining \"Universitas\". In 2008, he expressed much criticism for \"Orbitor\", a large-scale novelistic cycle by the \"Optzeci\u015fti\" group leader C\u0103rt\u0103rescu. In her critical overview of G\u00e2rbea's contributions, \"Observator Cultural\" chronicler Bianca Bur\u0163a-Cernat describes him as one among the lesser authors of the 1990s generation, alongside Dan-Silviu Boerescu and Mihail G\u0103l\u0103\u0163anu. Writing for the 2007 Columbia University \"Encyclopedia of Modern Drama\", Romanian-born Israeli actor-director Moshe Yassur included G\u00e2rbea \"among the best known\" of post-1989 playwrights \"experimenting with post-absurd-surrealist modes of expression.\" Others in this group are, according to his definition, Radu Macrinici, Alina Mungiu-Pippidi, Alina Nelega, Saviana St\u0103nescu, Matei Vi\u015fniec and Vlad Zografi. In a 2001 overview of the generation's contribution, Nelega herself mentioned G\u00e2rbea and the others alongside Valentin Nicolau and R\u0103zvan Petrescu.\nA defining characteristic of G\u00e2rbea's main works is the reliance on intertextuality, as compliments to his predecessors in drama, novel and poetry. Speaking in 2009, G\u00e2rbea himself recalled his stylistic discovery of the 1980s: \"It still seemed to me that being a writer meant having visions and struggling to communicate them so that others may have them too. [...] I could not write prose, but I enjoyed writing drama because I had invented something very fun to do: old characters in new situations.\" Poet and critic Octavian Soviany noted: \"Horia G\u00e2rbea is a dramatist who builds with a program in mind, placing his stake on the resources of parody and the intertextual play. The parodic here is given birth by the disabused conscience of a postmodern spirit, who knows that all books have been written and therefore only their 'rewriting' [...] is still possible\". Commenting on the texts grouped within \"Cine l-a ucis pe Marx?\", literary critic Mircea A. Diaconu placed the intertextual references (which often make a point of transgressing historical reality) in connection with William Shakespeare's phrase \"All the world's a stage\", since \"everything is possible at the level of the text becoming reality\". He praises the author for managing to preserve an \"absence that imposes\", by not making his own intervention felt in the text. Diaconu admits that such an approach could be read as \"gratuitously bookish, [where] a line is more important than an event, a pun more important than a murder\", but supports the notion that they all display an \"existential bearing\", accounting for an \"intrinsic value.\" He speaks of the technique as \"a vengeance of the theater\" on the traditional historical record: \"In essence, Horia G\u00e2rbea's theater emerges from the textual inconsistency of the world when faced with the consistency of history, or, better yet, from the inconsistency of history and the textual consistency of the world.\"\nGeneric traits and related polemics.\nBeyond its immediate context, critics see Horia G\u00e2rbea's contribution as greatly indebted to the work of 19th century dramatist and humorist Ion Luca Caragiale. According to Diaconu, Caragiale's influence constitutes the \"depth\" of G\u00e2rbea's work, going beyond the \"surface level\" of intertextual references and tributes. At the same core level, Diaconu identifies the author's debt to Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco, while also judging his manner of \"mixing eras, languages, writings, characters or historical figures, fiction and document\" to echo the techniques of Argentinian writer Jorge Luis Borges. Another main influence on G\u00e2rbea's work is interwar author Mateiu Caragiale, made famous by his cultivated style and eccentric outlook. Critic Dumitru Ungureanu sees this cultural echo as having been filtered by the style of Radu Albala, one of the authors to have been most inspired by the \"matein\" narratives, and concludes that the lineage places G\u00e2rbea on the same level as C\u0103rt\u0103rescu and Florin \u015elapac.\nAccording to his generation colleague, essayist Dan-Silviu Boerescu, G\u00e2rbea \"cannot part with the speculative charm of a brain given to bookish games\", but closely follows a realistic tradition with his \"sarcastic analysis of [...] all everyday weakness.\" For Boerescu, G\u00e2rbea's literature is supported by his sarcasm and his contribution to Romanian humor: \"Thin and edgy like a razor, G\u00e2rbea's style forgives no one no thing.\" Soviany also argues that the \"rewriting\" of texts attempted by the Romanian author is carried by \"absurd humor\" and \"the most unusual (as well as the most hilarious) arrangements of famous characters and quotes\". Poet and critic Paul Aretzu writes: \"The staple of [Horia G\u00e2rbea's] writing is inventive, farcical, the obvious attribute of intelligence and refinement, also displaying bookish support and being enhanced by zestful language. [...] The tendency of visualizing, of sketching portraits, of detailing/dissecting scenes, of verifying orality, the expressive value of the language, reveal the author's dominant structure as a playwright.\" The alternation of such stylistic traits reflects in part the writer's own parting with the \"Optzeci\u015fti\". The focus on everyday issues prompted C\u0103t\u0103lin \u0162\u00e2rlea to view G\u00e2rbea's 1990s prose as a revival of neorealism after the \"Optzeci\u015fti\" experimentalism. Boerescu however believes this verdict to be \"only half right\", since the writer continued to employ experimental devices long after 1989, while avoiding the \"referential ostentation\" of other writers. Appreciation of G\u00e2rbea's work was also expressed among older critics and G\u00e2rbea's own mentors. Nicolae Manolescu held G\u00e2rbea's contribution in high esteem, an, in his 2008 synthesis of Romanian literary history, spoke of him as having \"indisputably, the fabric of a dramatist\".\nIn Nelega's view, G\u00e2rbea, \"one of the truly alive writers of his time\", was among the few debuting local playwrights to have their works staged by prominent Romanian directors\u2014Alexandru Darie, Alexandru Hausvater and Gavril Pinte. G\u00e2rbea's fellow \"Rom\u00e2nia Literar\u0103\" contributor, literary historian Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu, contrasted his writings with the \"boring\" works by some of his contemporaries, and claimed that \"directors and actors take pleasure in staging [G\u00e2rbea's plays].\" G\u00e2rbea's work stands out within its cultural and temporal context for its size and diversity. Aretzu sees him as \"one of the most ubiquitous authors in present-day literature, [...] gifted with a great availability in processing reality\", while critic and academic Nicolae Oprea believes him to be \"the most prolific\" among the Bucharest-based group formed in the 1990s. Literary reviewer Daniel Cristea-Enache also describes his colleague as \"multilateral\" who \"can adapt himself with great ease to any particular genre's specificity\". Writing in 2007, \u015etef\u0103nescu defined him a \"one-man orchestra [...] of the apathetic (and sometimes shy-brazen) Romanian literature of today.\" According to Moldovan writer Emilian Galaicu-P\u0103un: \"As productive as an entire literary school [...], Horia G\u00e2rbea is a veritable Stakhanovite of writing, who has dealt in all genres and species\". G\u00e2rbea is also among the post-1990 Romanian authors to have received recognition abroad. In addition to the performances of \"The Serpent\" and \"Il \u00e9mmagement\", G\u00e2rbea's \"Ra\u0163\u0103 cu portocale\" has been translated into German by Veronika Dreichlinger (\"Ente mit Apfelsine\", published in 2005). His work was also included into English-, French-, German-, Russian- and Serbian-language anthologies.\nThere are several controversial aspects to G\u00e2rbea's public notoriety, involving reactions against academic verdicts, and objecting to the close relationship between G\u00e2rbea and mainstream cultural forums such as the USR. The implications of positive appraisals by these venues were debated by literary critic Bogdan Cre\u0163u, who argued that Nicolae Manolescu tended to overrate authors in his proximity, while being dismissive of Vi\u015fniec's contribution to drama (which Manolescu had claimed lacked originality). Critic Dan C. Mih\u0103ilescu criticized in particular Manolescu's \"caprices\", suggesting that, in a 2008 synthesis of Romanian literary history, his older colleague had assigned G\u00e2rbea's entry undeserved space, more than to a better known novelist like Gib Mih\u0103escu. Also according to Mih\u0103ilescu, C\u0103rt\u0103rescu may have had his rival G\u00e2rbea in mind when reproaching Manolescu that he had insisted on writers who were not at all worthy of recognition. Nicolae Oprea saw G\u00e2rbea as apparently \"uninhibited\" in matters of literary discourse, but critically noted that the poet was also preoccupied, \"to the point of obsession\", with his own cultural imprint (citing as proof the fact that, in its original version, \"Cre\u015fterea iguanelor de cas\u0103\" features the English-language versions of five poems, translated by G\u00e2rbea's own hand). A highly critical voice is that of Bianca Bur\u0163a-Cernat. She suggests that, in adopting all forms of writing, G\u00e2rbea displays \"an implausible self-certainty\". She polemically connects the critical appreciation with his status as a \"good colleague\" and \"devoted shadow\" of other writers, noting that G\u00e2rbea's notoriety is ensured by a promotional system with \"all the stakes\" and \"all the pulleys\", as well as by \"the argument of prolificity\", but that these attributes also surpass his actual value.\nPlays.\nUsually assigned by their author the name of \"texts\", in preference over \"plays\", several among G\u00e2rbea's earliest works for the stage are Postmodern reworkings of classical motifs, fashioned into new statements about the limits of literature. His \"Pesc\u0103ru\u015ful din livada cu vi\u015fini\" is a personal take on Anton Chekhov's \"Cherry Orchard\" and \"Seagull\". According to the author's own assessment, the text fits in with a Chekhovian homage trend among Romanian dramatists, also including Iosif Naghiu's (\"Chekhov the Armorer\") and Vi\u015fniec's \"La machine Tchekhov\" (\"The Chekhov Machine\"). Soviany singles out the text as an answer to claims that parody is always inferior to its models, by identifying its original motifs in a new statement about theater itself: \"[the play], which is without doubt ascribable to the formula of 'apocalyptic' theater, draws its substance from mixing intertextual parody with an eschatologic vision, suggesting the regression (of world and literature) into the primordial mud. Putting to use [...] the deluge myth, the dramatist this time imagines an apocalypse of fiction (of the theater), during which the characters [...] are slowly being swallowed by the mud flows of subterranean waters, which could imply that literature (fiction) unavoidably secretes its own death, so that writing (being written) and dying end up being perfect synonyms.\" In this analogy between literature and death, Soviany argues, one finds \"the most profound message of Horia G\u00e2rbea's theater\". In \"Doamna Bovary s\u00eent ceilal\u0163i\", the theme and protagonists are borrowed from Gustave Flaubert's 1857 novel, reused by the author to make a statement about drama itself and combined with elements from Jean-Paul Sartre's \"No Exit\". In addition to such themes, Mircea A. Diaconu sees G\u00e2rbea's reflection on the conflict between history and fiction as personified by the lead character in \"St\u0103p\u00e2nul t\u0103cerii\": the Egyptian god Thoth, who bestows the gift of language on man, is depicted as \"the prototype of traitors.\"\nPublished ten years after the Romanian Revolution, \"Decembrie, \u00een direct\" recounts a changing of roles between torturer and victim, set to the background of political turmoil. In the first part, it introduces the two protagonists: a failed boxer turned interrogator for the main communist repressive structure, the Securitate, who confronts his prisoner, a renegade nomenklatura member who has become a dissident. What is supposed to be an ordeal for the latter turns into a revelation for the former: the dissident is successful in assuring his interrogator that communism is doomed, and both flee the prison to partake in the victorious Revolution. The second part sees the dissident transformed into an agent for the reformed Intelligence Service, who displays no qualms about capturing, tormenting and finally killing his former associate. Historiographer and critic Ruxandra Cesereanu connects the outcome with a notoriously violent episode in Romania's communist history, the brainwashing experiment carried out by the Securitate in Pite\u015fti prison: \"The paradox and moral-antimoral of Horia G\u00e2rbea's play is that the victim [...] proves himself tougher, more of an executioner, than his torturer. This means that the lines between victim and executioner are blurred and that, ultimately, the reeducation experiment in Pite\u015fti prison (1949\u20131952), when victims were forced into becoming torturers, has succeeded. The antimoral in G\u00e2rbea's play is, however, all the more tough as the victim here becomes a torturer without being made to do so.\" Cesereanu ranks it and Radu Macrinici's \"T/\u0162ara mea\" (approx. \"My Dead Weight/Country\") among the post-1989 dramatic texts to have \"brought up [...] the Securitate issue, in a trenchant and even revelatory manner\". G\u00e2rbea's fellow playwright Alina Nelega notes that \"Decembrie, \u00een direct\" is his first entirely original text for the stage, and rates it over intertextual texts from the same period.\nPublished alongside \"Decembrie, \u00een direct\", \"Capul lui Mo\u0163oc\" (\"Mo\u0163oc's Head\") reinterprets \"Alexandru L\u0103pu\u015fneanu\", a novella by the Romanian classic Costache Negruzzi, which romanticizes events in Moldavia's medieval history. Integrating further allusions to Romanian folklore (the \"Me\u015fterul Manole\" myth), Shakespeare and various others, it is also seen by Alina Nelega as a close rendition of Ion Luca Caragiale's style. The protagonist, a treacherous Moldavian boyar by the name of Mo\u0163oc, uses a discourse rich in political imagery, and towards the end of the play reveals himself as an \"alter ego\" of communist theorist Karl Marx. Nelega is critical of the text, arguing that it \"does not surpass the gratuitousness of petty pokes\" and is \"more burlesque than absurd\", concluding: \"I fear that G\u00e2rbea did not know how to end his play and quickly fabricated, \"deus ex machina\", the similitude of a profound sense where there was nothing.\"\nThe three-character comedy and satire \"Cafeaua domnului Ministru\", seen by poet and literary chronicler Emil Mladin as one \"of morals\", turns its attention to Romania's political scene, showing the stormy encounter between a matron, a female secretary and a politician. The dialogues are seen by Mladin as \"a parody of the discourses with which just about any television station assassinates us\", and, Nelega writes, \"the lampoon has precise targets\". The story pokes fun at the Social Democratic Party and Romanian Democratic Convention governments of the post-1989 period, and, according to dramatist and theater critic Mihaela Michailov, was \"adequate\" in the context of 2000 elections. Michailov highlights the play's symbolism as illustrating \"the stupidity of the political mechanism\", whose sphere is turned into \"a sort of no man's land where everything is possible.\" According to Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu, productions of \"Cafeaua domnului Ministru\" receive as much applause as \"a rock music recital.\" With \"Leonida XXI\", the author returned to intertextual reworkings, this time introducing his style to the works of Ion Luca Caragiale, \"Conu Leonida fa\u0163\u0103 cu reac\u0163iunea\" and \"O scrisoare pierdut\u0103\". The play was notably used as teaching material for student actors training at the Caragiale Academy under Mircea Albulescu, who called it \"extremely interesting\".\nFrom \"C\u0103derea Bastiliei\" to \"Cre\u015fterea iguanelor de cas\u0103\".\nWith his debut novel \"C\u0103derea Bastiliei\", G\u00e2rbea produces a satirical portrayal of his fellow Romanian writers, disguising their real names with anagrams or other word play. Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu, who writes that such portrayals caused \"great agitation in the literary world\", cites the author's own mock-disclaimer: \"The identification of some characters with real person constitutes an abuse of interpretation which the author intends to fight off with any legal means.\" \u015etef\u0103nescu however cautions against reading \"C\u0103derea Bastiliei\" purely as a \"roman \u00e0 clef\", since the inspiration from \"writers' deeds\" is \"capricious\" and the resemblance with real persons \"partial\". A similar opinion was voiced by poet and journalist Cornelia Maria Savu, who compared the narrator to a puppeteer and further assessed: \"Horia G\u00e2rbea does not hate his characters, does not love them, he understands them. And by understanding them, he offers them a few moments to evolve with no strings.\" Reviewing the work from a stylistic point of view, Paul Aretzu analyzes the intrusion of \"intertextual indulgences\" throughout the work, identifying allusions to Ion Luca Caragiale, Franz Kafka, Ioan Alexandru Br\u0103tescu-Voine\u015fti and others, while also noting the presence of experimental methods echoing James Joyce's \"Ulysses\". \u015etef\u0103nescu attributes such presences to parody, noting in passing the introduction of situations and even entire passages from Kafka's \"Metamorphosis\" and Albert Camus' \"The Plague\".\nThe narrative delves into Bucharest's bohemian environment, its heroes being vagrants, misfits or alcoholics who lead tragicomic lifestyles. The plot, deemed \"to die for\" by Galaicu-P\u0103un, notably shows writer and former inmate Aldu R\u0103dulescu seducing literary chronicler Alteea Fleciu, as revenge for a negative review of his work. In Paul Aretzu's view, the manner in which such developments are presented constitutes \"a continuous demonstration of brilliant intelligence and spectacular linguistic imagination.\" He commends a chapter of the book, which discusses how groups of people differentiated by their respective drinking cultures, for being \"a sort of poem dedicated to the kinds of drink and drunks in a small alcoholic town\", while noting that a similar section, dedicated to the attitudes of writers when faced with fatal diseases, \"creates, with the means of the grotesque, a \"sui generis\" mythology of the writers' caste\". The latter episode is praised by \u015etef\u0103nescu for its \"irresistible\" black humor and its \"devilish verve\". The same commentator states: \"The novelist has a joy of writing that transmits itself to the reader. After you finish reading this novel about the ugliness of (literary) life [...], you feel, paradoxically, the joy of living, of communicating, of partaking in the captivating spectacle of being.\" In Artezu's account, those parts of \"C\u0103derea Bastiliei\" in which G\u00e2rbea discusses the annual competition for literary prizes offer evidence both a \"captivating\" humorous focus on everyday occurrences and an \"innocent cynicism, characteristic for the author\". He argues: \"With all the signs of his emotional involvement [...], the author also exercises, through correlations [and] quotes, the function of depersonalization, of estrangement, of laughing at one's misfortunes, of projecting oneself into clich\u00e9s, [...] of surrogate existence.\" Literary reviewer Cosmin Ciotlo\u015f issues a more reserved verdict on the text: in his view, the episodes of \"C\u0103derea Bastiliei\" are primarily \"charades\", whose main quality is being \"droll\".\nOverall, Horia G\u00e2rbea's contribution to short fiction is described by Alex. \u015etef\u0103nescu as \"ingenious\" and \"endearing\". The political fiction of is described by Boerescu as \"a multitude of sub-worlds\" structured around \"framework situations\", moving between the \"petty politics of the day\" (targeting the Social Democratic Party) and ironic parables or dystopias. Boerescu writes: \"The author cannot refrain from endlessly staging acts and short plays or inserting lines with an obvious dramatic hue\". The same commentator identifies in the stories several allusions, homages or intertextual borrowings, from the \"semiotic games\" of Umberto Eco to a \"landscape of luxuriant vegetation\" characteristic for the Latin American Boom writers. This symbolism is coupled with allusions to Romanian literary life: the final story in the collection, \"Motanii din bibliotec\u0103\" (\"The Tomcats in the Study Hall\"), speculates about the future of G\u00e2rbea's generation, and depicts bibliophiles keeping pets named after the leading literary critics of the 1980s and '90s.\nAmong his poetry collections, \"Cre\u015fterea iguanelor de cas\u0103\" drew attention for transferring the intertextual and parodic conventions into a lyrical format, mostly free verse. According to \u015etef\u0103nescu, it and his other poetry collections are \"better than those by most contemporary authors who emphatically recommend themselves as poets.\" Nicolae Oprea noted in particular the reworking of a motif borrowed from Sibiu Circle poet \u015etefan Augustin Doina\u015f and his \"Mistre\u0163ul cu col\u0163i de argint\": the \"prince from the Levant\", whom G\u00e2rbea transfers into the destitute world of garbage collectors. Part of it reads:\nOprea also highlighted ironic and dismissive borrowings from Romania's national poet Mihai Eminescu, and from poets laureate such as Octavian Goga and Vasile Alecsandri, as well as an actual lineage from the black humor of 1930s Surrealists. He sees a direct link between G\u00e2rbea and the Romanian Surrealist group's Gellu Naum, and beyond, to the \"existential\" absurdism of Ionesco and Kafka. Also according to Oprea, such texts \"are raised as collages of everyday images and bookish suggestions, well tied to each other, to the point where their articulation into colloquial speech puts to use the technique of reabsorbing the dramatic element and the narrative nucleus of balladesque nature into the sphere of pure lyricism.\"\n\"Crime la Elsinore\" and \"Trecute Vie\u0163i de Fan\u0163i \u015fi de Birlici\".\n\"Crime la Elsinore\" is a return to prose satire, in this case directed at the theatrical environment. The setting is a fictional theater in provincial C\u0103l\u0103ra\u015fi, deriving its name from the Getic ruler Dromichaetes, and the protagonists, Cosmin Ciotlo\u015f notes, are composite portrayals rather than the \"masked\" characters of \"C\u0103derea Bastiliei\". He argues: \"Whichever way you look at it, set free from the contextual interpretations exercised in reading tabloids, the novel stands only to gain.\" The narrative focus is on the kitschy ambition of a failed theater manager, Cosma, who proceeds to conflate all the violent moments of Shakespearean tragedy into a single show of regular proportions. The project is increasingly confused, and the text used by Cosma mixes Shakespeare's lines with quotes from Pierre Beaumarchais, Euripides and Moli\u00e8re, while adopting the format of a detective novel.\nCiotlo\u015f reproached \"Crime la Elsinore\" for lack of subtlety, in the presence of a \"not exactly indispensable\" glossary of terms which was published with the book. Although he acknowledges that the writing is \"amusing\", he also contends that it is \"impossible to extend sociologically or connect to some reality\", being isolated \"in its own world\", and displaying \"compositional precariousness.\" He concludes: \"A book perfect in its own way, but far from perfection in ours.\" A similar overview is provided by Bur\u0163a-Cernat, who contends that, in taking sides and explaining his intentions, the author adopts \"the manner of an untalented journalist\", with \"see-through\" results. She also believes that G\u00e2rbea's chief comedic resource is \"the cheap anecdote with a trite climax\", which she compares with those published by the communist-era magazine \"Urzica\". Additionally, Bur\u0163a-Cernat comments on the irony of Cosma's reliance on intertextuality, which she finds similar to G\u00e2rbea's own work for the stage. Critic Andrei Terian noted that he disliked almost all the book, because of its author's tendency to humiliate his characters \"before us readers are in the least familiarized with them.\"\nIn \"Trecute Vie\u0163i de Fan\u0163i \u015fi de Birlici\", G\u00e2rbea revisits the main themes of Romanian literature, looking into the biographies of various fictional characters, their lifestyles, personal preferences and social positioning. He himself defined the overview as \"a sort of collection of essays on the edge of literary history.\" One of its chapters compares the tabletop games entertaining such figures, from the contract bridge parties in Camil Petrescu's books and the antiquated card games in Mateiu Caragiale's \"Craii de Curtea-Veche\" to the cruder craps and gambling preferred by thieves in Eugen Barbu's novels. Other sections discuss the attitudes toward love in such diverse places as Marin Sorescu's neorealist prose and the fantasy short stories of Mircea Eliade. Likewise, the avatars of violence are depicted between Ion Luca Caragiale's satire \"D-ale carnavalului\", where people threaten to poison each other with sulfuric acid, Anton Bacalba\u015fa's depictions of officers disciplining their subordinates with the use of belts, and Marin Preda's \"Morome\u0163ii\", where peasants beat each other with clubs. Another part of the book deals with the incidence of failure among intellectual protagonists, and leads G\u00e2rbea to conclude that, with the exception of Mihail Sebastian's \"Accidentul\", Romanian narratives generally show their intellectual protagonists incapable of finding their way in life. According to Daniel Cristea-Enache, G\u00e2rbea generally and willingly limited the scope of his investigation to canonical and urbane literary realism, avoiding allegorical styles such as Onirism: \"the author is not interested in symbolic codification, in the refraction of the characters and their fictional world; but, quite the contrary, in the points and lines at which literature intersects with social life.\"\nIn his review of the volume, Emil Mladin deemed it \"wonderful\" and \"an extremely welcome project\", noting: \"\"Trecute Vie\u0163i de Fan\u0163i \u015fi de Birlici\" represents a link which the reader needed in his relationship with the characters of stories relevant both at the time of their writing and today.\" According to literary critic Silvia Dumitrache, the book creates \"new paths in interpretation [...] even when starting from literary locations that are often threatened with turning into clich\u00e9s.\" She concludes \"Through the playful note he impresses on the book, Horia G\u00e2rbea proves that his main intention does not reside in the willingness to impose a new hermeneutic grid on Romanian literature, but in the attempt to demonstrate that the resources of literature can never, ever, be entirely exhausted.\" Cristea-Enache sees in \"Trecute Vie\u0163i de Fan\u0163i \u015fi de Birlici\" \"a book as interesting as it is enjoyable [...]. A holiday read, one could say, had this sytagm not been bastardized, in our country, by so many printed works (volumes and journals alike) that offend the reader's intellect.\"\nOutside the critical reevaluation of local literature, G\u00e2rbea's work includes short humorous essays about various topics in post-1989 society and modern Romanian culture. One such chapter is built around the polemic between G\u00e2rbea and writer Gheorghe Grigurcu, over the issue of what it means for a working artist to be treated unjustly or be privileged. Another fragment documents and ridicules the impact of instant messaging on the Romanian lexis, with the rapid spread of abbreviations such as \"sal\" (for \"salut\", \"hello\"), \"vb\" (\"vorbim\", \"we'll talk\") and \"ms\" (\"mersi\", \"thanks\"). G\u00e2rbea also pokes fun at the babytalk-based jargon of parenting magazines, and contrasts its apparent artificiality with the awe he records having personally experienced after the birth of his son Tudor. It reads: \"[He] does not inspire in me the image of fragility and fondness, but the force of an entity which benefits from the advantage of The Unknown. When I call him using his human name, he smiles down on me, with devastating irony, so that I may grasp my complete lack of fantasizing ability. No matter what will happen in the future, these winter days [...] shall always remain for me under the sign of having met, for the first time in life, an inexplicable creature.\"\nOther works.\n\"Fratele mai de\u015ftept al lui Kala\u015fnikov\", which comprises several stories, received mixed reviews. According to Andrei Terian, the main one, \"Articolul 96\" (\"Article 96\"), which is about a lecherous politician dating an anorexic model, has the same defects as \"Crime...\". In contrast, Terian notes, G\u00e2rbea shows his \"sure hand\" in other pieces, where he parodies \"Povestea unui om lene\u015f\" (\"The Story of a Lazy Man\") by 19th century Romanian classic Ion Creang\u0103, or where he pokes fun at the 14th century Battle of Rovine, as well as the absurdist \"\u00centoarcerea tatei din r\u0103zboi. Subiecte\" (\"Father's Return from War. Subjects\"), where the same narrative clich\u00e9 is explored from several conflicting perspectives. According to Terian, the volume as a whole displays influences from poet and satirist Tudor Arghezi, as well as borrowings from fellow parodist Ioan Gro\u015fan.\n\"Azerbaijan \u2013 The Living Flame\" details G\u00e2rbea's trip and offers additional insight into the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict between Azerbaijani people and Armenians. It features his poems about Shusha city, the Khojaly Massacre and the Guba mass grave. The texts received criticism from the Armenian Romanian community's \"Ararat\" journal: it specifically called \"disinformation\" the fragments which refer to Azerbaijan's Christian past, and expressed concern over G\u00e2rbea's claim that Heydar Aliyev was \"a civilizing providential hero\"."}
{"title": "M._R._James", "label": "Writer", "text": "Montague Rhodes James (1 August 1862 \u2013 12 June 1936) was an English author, medievalist scholar and provost of King's College, Cambridge (1905\u20131918), and of Eton College (1918\u20131936). He was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cambridge (1913\u201315).\nJames's work as a medievalist and scholar is still highly regarded, but he is best remembered for his ghost stories, which some consider among the best in the genre. He redefined the ghost story for the new century by abandoning many of the formal Gothic clich\u00e9s of his predecessors and using more realistic contemporary settings. However, his protagonists and plots tend to reflect his own antiquarian interests. Accordingly, he is known as the originator of the \"antiquarian ghost story\".\nEarly life.\nJames was born in a clergy house in Goodnestone, Dover, Kent, England, although his parents had associations with Aldeburgh in Suffolk. His father was Herbert James, an Evangelical Anglican clergyman, and his mother, Mary Emily (\"n\u00e9e\" Horton), was the daughter of a naval officer. He had two older brothers, Sydney and Herbert (nicknamed \"Ber\"), and an older sister, Grace. Sydney James later became Archdeacon of Dudley. From the age of three (1865) until 1909 James's home, if not always his residence, was at the Rectory in Great Livermere, Suffolk. This had previously been the childhood home of another eminent Suffolk antiquary, Thomas Martin of Palgrave (1696\u20131771). Several of James's ghost stories are set in Suffolk, including \"'Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad'\" (Felixstowe), \"A Warning to the Curious\" (Aldeburgh), \"Rats\" and \"A Vignette\" (Great Livermere).\nIn September 1873 he arrived as a boarder at Temple Grove School in East Sheen in west London, one of the leading boys' preparatory schools of the day. From September 1876 to August 1882 he studied at Eton College, where he claims to have translated the \"Book of Baruch\" from its original Ethiopic in 1879. He lived for many years, first as an undergraduate (1882\u20131885), then as a don and provost, at King's College, Cambridge, where he was also a member of the Pitt Club. The university provides settings for several of his tales. Apart from medieval subjects, James toured Europe often, including a memorable 1884 tour of France in a Cheylesmore tricycle, studied the classics and appeared very successfully in a staging of Aristophanes' play \"The Birds\", with music by Hubert Parry. His ability as an actor was also apparent when he read his new ghost stories to friends at Christmas time.\nScholarly works.\nJames is best known for his ghost stories, but his work as a medievalist scholar was prodigious and remains highly respected in scholarly circles. Indeed, the success of his stories was founded on his antiquarian talents and knowledge. His discovery of a manuscript fragment led to excavations in the ruins of the abbey at Bury St Edmunds, West Suffolk, in 1902, in which the graves of several twelfth-century abbots described by Jocelyn de Brakelond (a contemporary chronicler) were rediscovered, having been lost since the Dissolution of the Monasteries. He published a detailed description of the sculptured ceiling bosses of the cloisters of Norwich Cathedral in 1911. This included drawings of all the bosses in the north walk by C. J. W. Winter. His 1917 edition of the Latin hagiography of \u00c6thelberht II of East Anglia, king and martyr, remains authoritative.\nHe catalogued many of the manuscript libraries of the colleges of the University of Cambridge. Among his other scholarly works, he wrote \"The Apocalypse in Art\", which placed the English Apocalypse manuscripts into families. He also translated the New Testament apocrypha and contributed to the \"Encyclopaedia Biblica\" (1903). His ability to wear his learning lightly is apparent in his \"Suffolk and Norfolk\" (Dent, 1930), in which a great deal of knowledge is presented in a popular and accessible form, and in \"Abbeys\".\nHe also achieved a great deal during his directorship of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge (1893\u20131908). He managed to secure a large number of important paintings and manuscripts, including notable portraits by Titian.\nJames was Provost of Eton College from 1918 to 1936. He was awarded the Order of Merit in 1930. He died in 1936 (age 73) and was buried in Eton town cemetery.\nGhost stories.\nJames's ghost stories were published in a series of collections: \"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\" (1904), \"More Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\" (1911), \"A Thin Ghost and Others\" (1919), and \"A Warning to the Curious and Other Ghost Stories\" (1925). The first hardback collected edition appeared in 1931. Many of the tales were written as Christmas Eve entertainments and read aloud to friends. This idea was used by the BBC in 2000 when they filmed Christopher Lee reading James's stories in a candle-lit room in King's College.\nJames perfected a method of story-telling which has since become known as Jamesian. The classic Jamesian tale usually includes the following elements:\nAccording to James, the story must \"put the reader into the position of saying to himself, 'If I'm not very careful, something of this kind may happen to me!'\" He also perfected the technique of narrating supernatural events through implication and suggestion, letting his reader fill in the blanks, and focusing on the mundane details of his settings and characters in order to throw the horrific and bizarre elements into greater relief. He summed up his approach in his foreword to the anthology \"Ghosts and Marvels\": \"Two ingredients most valuable in the concocting of a ghost story are, to me, the atmosphere and the nicely managed crescendo. ... Let us, then, be introduced to the actors in a placid way; let us see them going about their ordinary business, undisturbed by forebodings, pleased with their surroundings; and into this calm environment let the ominous thing put out its head, unobtrusively at first, and then more insistently, until it holds the stage.\"\nHe also noted: \"Another requisite, in my opinion, is that the ghost should be malevolent or odious: amiable and helpful apparitions are all very well in fairy tales or in local legends, but I have no use for them in a fictitious ghost story.\"\nDespite his suggestion (in the essay \"Stories I Have Tried to Write\") that writers employ reticence in their work, many of James's tales depict scenes and images of savage and often disturbing violence. For example, in \"Lost Hearts\", pubescent children are taken in by a sinister dabbler in the occult who cuts their hearts from their still-living bodies. In a 1929 essay, James stated:\nReticence may be an elderly doctrine to preach, yet from the artistic point of view, I am sure it is a sound one. Reticence conduces to effect, blatancy ruins it, and there is much blatancy in a lot of recent stories. They drag in sex too, which is a fatal mistake; sex is tiresome enough in the novels; in a ghost story, or as the backbone of a ghost story, I have no patience with it. At the same time don't let us be mild and drab. Malevolence and terror, the glare of evil faces, 'the stony grin of unearthly malice', pursuing forms in darkness, and 'long-drawn, distant screams', are all in place, and so is a modicum of blood, shed with deliberation and carefully husbanded; the weltering and wallowing that I too often encounter merely recall the methods of M G Lewis.\nAlthough not overtly sexual, plots of this nature have been perceived as unintentional metaphors of the Freudian variety. James's biographer Michael Cox wrote in \"M. R. James: An Informal Portrait\" (1983), \"One need not be a professional psychoanalyst to see the ghost stories as some release from feelings held in check.\" Reviewing this biography (\"Daily Telegraph\", 1983), the novelist and diarist Anthony Powell, who attended Eton under James's tutelage, commented that \"I myself have heard it suggested that James's (of course platonic) love affairs were in fact fascinating to watch.\" Powell was referring to James's relationships with his pupils, not his peers.\nOther critics have seen complex psychological undercurrents in James's work. His authorial revulsion from tactile contact with other people has been noted by Julia Briggs in \"Night Visitors: The Rise and Fall of the English Ghost Story\" (1977). As Nigel Kneale wrote in the introduction to the Folio Society edition of \"Ghost Stories of M. R. James\", \"In an age where every man is his own psychologist, M. R. James looks like rich and promising material. ... There must have been times when it was hard to be Monty James.\" Or, to put it another way, \"Although James conjures up strange beasts and supernatural manifestations, the shock effect of his stories is usually strongest when he is dealing in physical mutilation and abnormality, generally sketched in with the lightest of pens.\"\nIn addition to writing his own stories, James championed the works of Sheridan Le Fanu, whom he viewed as \"absolutely in the first rank as a writer of ghost stories\", editing and supplying introductions to \"Madame Crowl's Ghost\" (1923) and \"Uncle Silas\" (1926).\nJames's statements about his actual beliefs about ghosts are ambiguous. He wrote, \"I answer that I am prepared to consider evidence and accept it if it satisfies me.\"\nViews on literature and politics.\nJames held strongly traditional views about literature. In addition to ghost stories, he also enjoyed reading the work of William Shakespeare and the detective stories of Agatha Christie. He disliked most contemporary literature, strongly criticising the work of Aldous Huxley, Lytton Strachey and James Joyce (whom he called \"a charlatan\" and \"that prostitutor of life and language\"). He also supported the banning of Radclyffe Hall's 1928 novel about lesbianism, \"The Well of Loneliness\", stating, \"I believe Miss Hall's book is about birth control or some kindred subject, isn't it? I find it difficult to believe either that it is a good novel or that its suppression causes any loss to literature.\"\nWhen he was a student at King's, James had opposed the appointment of Thomas Henry Huxley as Provost of Eton because of Huxley's agnosticism; he later became Provost of Eton himself. In his later life James showed little interest in politics and rarely spoke on political issues. However, he often spoke out against the Irish Home Rule movement, and in his letters he also expressed a dislike for Communism. His friend A. C. Benson considered him to be \"reactionary\", and \"against modernity and progress\".\nReception and influence.\nH. P. Lovecraft was an admirer of James's work, extolling the stories as the peak of the ghost story form in his essay \"Supernatural Horror in Literature\" (1927). Another renowned fan of James in the horror and fantasy genre was Clark Ashton Smith, who wrote an essay on him. Michael Sadleir described James as \"the best ghost-story writer England has ever produced\". Marjorie Bowen also admired his work, referring to his ghost stories as \"the supreme art of M. R. James\". Mary Butts, another admirer, wrote the first critical essay on his work, \"The Art of Montagu James\", in the February 1934 issue of the \"London Mercury\". Manly Wade Wellman esteemed his fiction. In \"The Great Railway Bazaar\", Paul Theroux refers to \"The Mezzotint\" as \"the most frightening story I know\". In his list \"The 13 Most Terrifying Horror Stories\", T. E. D. Klein placed James's \"Casting the Runes\" at number one. E. F. Bleiler stated that James is \"in the opinion of many, the foremost modern writer of supernatural fiction\", and he described \"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\" as \"one of the landmark books in the history of supernatural fiction\" and characterised the stories in James's other collections as \"first-rate stories\" and \"excellent stories\". Ruth Rendell has also expressed admiration for James's work, stating, \"There are some authors one wished one had never read in order to have the joy of reading them for the first time. For me, M. R. James is one of these.\" David Langford has described James as the author of \"the 20th century's most influential canon of ghost stories\".\nSir John Betjeman, in an introduction to Peter Haining's book about James, shows how influenced he was by James's work:\nIn the year 1920 I was a new boy at the Dragon school, Oxford, then called Lynam's, of which the headmaster was C. C. Lynam, known as 'the Skipper'. He dressed and looked like an old Sea Salt, and in his gruff voice would tell us stories by firelight in the boys' room of an evening with all the lights out and his back to the fire. I remember he told the stories as having happened to himself. ... they were the best stories I ever heard, and gave me an interest in old churches, and country houses, and Scandinavia that not even the mighty Hans Christian Andersen eclipsed.\nBetjeman later discovered the stories were all based on those of M. R. James.\nH. Russell Wakefield's supernatural fiction was strongly influenced by the work of James. A large number of British writers deliberately wrote ghost stories in the Jamesian style; these writers, sometimes described as the \"James Gang\", include A. N. L. Munby, E. G. Swain, \"Ingulphus\" (pseudonym of Sir Arthur Gray, 1852\u20131940), Amyas Northcote and R. H. Malden, although some commentators consider their stories to be inferior to those of James himself. Although most of the early Jamesian writers were male, there were several notable female writers of such fiction, including Eleanor Scott (pseudonym of Helen M. Leys, 1892\u20131965) in the stories of her book \"Randall's Round\" (1929) and D. K. Broster in the collection \"Couching at the Door: Strange and Macabre Tales\" (1942). L. T. C. Rolt also modelled his ghost stories on James's work, but, unlike other Jamesian writers, set them in industrial locations, such as mines and railways.\nJames's stories continue to influence many of today's great supernatural writers, including Stephen King (who discusses James in the 1981 non-fiction book \"Danse Macabre\") and Ramsey Campbell, who edited \"Meddling with Ghosts: Stories in the Tradition of M. R. James\" and wrote the short story \"The Guide\" in tribute. The author John Bellairs paid homage to James by incorporating plot elements borrowed from James's ghost stories into several of his own juvenile mysteries. Several of Jonathan Aycliffe's novels, including \"Whispers in the Dark\" and \"The Matrix\" are influenced by James's work. Aycliffe/MacEoin studied for his PhD in Persian Studies at King's College, Cambridge. This makes three King's College authors of ghost stories (James, Munby and Aycliffe).\nWorks inspired by James.\nThe composer Kaikhosru Shapurji Sorabji wrote two pieces for piano with a link to James: \"Quaere reliqua hujus materiei inter secretiora\" (1940), inspired by \"Count Magnus\", and \"St. Bertrand de Comminges: \"He was laughing in the tower\"\" (1941), inspired by \"Canon Alberic's Scrap-Book\".\nH. Russell Wakefield's story \"He Cometh and He Passeth By!\" (1928) is a homage to James's \"Casting the Runes\".\nW. F. Harvey's ghost story \"The Ankardyne Pew\" (1928) is also a homage to James's work, which Harvey admired.\nGerald Heard's novel \"The Black Fox\" is an occult thriller inspired by \"The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral\".\nKingsley Amis' novel \"The Green Man\" is partly a homage to James's ghost stories.\nBetween 1976 and 1992, Sheila Hodgson authored and produced for BBC Radio 4 a series of plays which portrayed M. R. James as the diarist of a series of fictional ghost stories, mainly inspired by fragments referred to in his essay \"Stories I Have Tried to Write\". These consisted of \"Whisper in the Ear\" (October 1976), \"Turn, Turn, Turn\" (March 1977), \"The Backward Glance\" (22 September 1977), \"Here Am I, Where Are You?\" (29 December 1977), \"Echoes from the Abbey\" (21 November 1984), \"The Lodestone\" (19 April 1989), and \"The Boat Hook\" (15 April 1992). David March appeared as James in all but the final two, which starred Michael Williams. Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann also broadcast \"The Fellow Travellers\", with Aiden Grennell as James, on 20 February 1994. All the stories later appeared in Hodgson's collection \"The Fellow Travellers and Other Ghost Stories\" (Ash-Tree Press, 1998).\nOn Christmas Day 1987, \"The Teeth of Abbot Thomas\", a James parody by Stephen Sheridan, was broadcast on Radio 4. It starred Alfred Marks (as Abbot Thomas), Robert Bathurst, Denise Coffey, Jonathan Adams and Bill Wallis.\nIn 1989, Ramsey Campbell published the short story \"The Guide\", which takes an antiquarian on a macabre journey to a ruined church after following marginalia in a copy of James's guidebook \"Suffolk and Norfolk\". In 2001, Campbell edited the anthology \"Meddling with Ghosts: Stories in the Tradition of M. R. James\".\nThe novelist James Hynes wrote an updated version of \"Casting the Runes\" in his 1997 story collection \"Publish and Perish\".\nIn 2003, Radio 4 broadcast \"The House at World's End\" by Stephen Sheridan. A pastiche of James's work, it contained numerous echoes of his stories while offering a fictional account of how he became interested in the supernatural. The older James was played by John Rowe, and the younger James by Jonathan Keeble.\nIn 2008 the English experimental neofolk duo The Triple Tree, featuring Tony Wakeford and Andrew King from Sol Invictus, released the album \"Ghosts\" on which all but three songs were based upon the stories of James. One of the songs, \"Three Crowns\" (based on the short story \"A Warning to the Curious\"), also appeared on the compilation album \"John Barleycorn Reborn\" (2007).\nIn February 2012, the UK psychedelic band The Future Kings of England released their 4th album, \"Who Is This Who Is Coming\", based on James's \"Oh, Whistle, and I\u2019ll Come to You, My Lad\". An instrumental work, it evokes the story from beginning to end, with the tracks segueing into one another to form a continuous piece of music.\nOn 23 February 2012 the Royal Mail released a stamp featuring James as part its \"Britons of Distinction\" series.\nIn 2013, the Fan Museum in London hosted two performances of \"The Laws of Shadows\", a play by Adrian Drew about M. R. James. The play is set in James's rooms at Cambridge University and deals with his relationships with his colleague E. F. Benson and the young artist James McBryde.\nOn 9 January 2019, in the third episode of the seventh series of the BBC One programme \"Father Brown\", titled \"The Whistle in the Dark\", the character Professor Robert Wiseman reads a collection of ghost stories by M. R. James and later suggests that the whistle in his possession in the one described in James's \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\".\nComedian and writer John Finnemore is a fan of the ghost stories of M. R. James. His radio sketch series \"John Finnemore's Souvenir Programme\", first broadcast in 2011, features the recurring character of a storyteller (a fictionalised version of Finnemore) who tells tall tales partly influenced by M. R. James's ghost stories. During the ninth series broadcast in 2021, which underwent a format change due to the coronavirus pandemic, Oswald 'Uncle Newt' Nightingale, analogous with Finnemore's storyteller character, meets M. R. James during the Christmas of 1898 as a young boy, who proceeds to tell him the story of \"The Rose Garden\". Later in Uncle Newt's life (or earlier in the series), he tells an iteration of said story whilst babysitting Deborah and Myra Wilkinson.\nAdaptations.\nTelevision.\nThere have been numerous television adaptations of James's stories. The very first TV adaptation was American\u2014a 1951 version of \"The Tractate Middoth\" in the \"Lights Out\" series, called \"The Lost Will of Dr Rant\" and featuring Leslie Nielsen. It is available on several DVDs, including an Alpha Video release alongside Gore Vidal's \"Climax!\" adaptation of \"Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde\", starring Michael Rennie.\nThe majority of television adaptations of James's works have been made in Britain. The best-known adaptations include \"Whistle and I'll Come to You\" (1968, directed by Jonathan Miller) and \"A Warning to the Curious\" (1972; directed by Lawrence Gordon Clark), starring Michael Hordern and Peter Vaughan respectively. The latter was part of an annual BBC series titled \"A Ghost Story for Christmas\", which would ultimately produce five dramatizations of James's stories in the 1970s: \"The Stalls of Barchester\" (1971), \"A Warning to the Curious\" (1972), \"Lost Hearts\" (1973), \"The Treasure of Abbot Thomas\" (1974) and \"The Ash-tree\" (1975).\nAlthough ITV produced four black-and-white adaptations of James's ghost stories between 1966 and 1968, no surviving copies are known to exist. However, a short preview trailer featuring several scenes from the 1968 adaptation of \"Casting the Runes\" survived and has been shown at cult film festivals. The trailer is also available on Network DVD's \"Mystery and Imagination\" DVD set. \"Casting the Runes\" was again adapted for television in 1979 as an episode of the \"ITV Playhouse\" series with Lawrence Gordon Clark directing and starring Jan Francis as the lead protagonist (a man in previous adaptations). It has been released by Network DVD which also includes a 20-minute adaptation of \"Mr Humphreys and His Inheritance\" (made in 1976 by Yorkshire Television as part of the \"Music Scene\" ITV Schools programme) and \"A Pleasant Terror\", a 1995 ITV documentary about James.\nIn 1980, the BBC produced a series, aimed at older children, of readings of classic horror stories read by various actors entitled \"Spine Chillers\". This included readings of James's stories \"The Mezzotint\", \"The Diary of Mr Poynter\" and \"A School Story\", all read by Michael Bryant. In December 1986, BBC2 broadcast partially dramatized readings by the actor Robert Powell of \"The Mezzotint\", \"The Ash-Tree\", \"Wailing Well\", \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\" and \"The Rose Garden\". In a similar vein, the BBC also produced a short series (\"M. R. James' Ghost Stories for Christmas\") of further readings in 2000, which featured Christopher Lee as James, who (in character) read 30-minute adaptations of \"The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral\", \"The Ash-tree\", \"Number 13\" and \"A Warning to the Curious\".\nThe \"Ghost Story for Christmas\" strand was revived in December 2005, when BBC Four broadcast a new version of James's story \"A View from a Hill\", with \"Number 13\" following in December 2006. These were broadly faithful to the originals and were well received. A new version of \"Whistle and I'll Come to You\", starring John Hurt, was broadcast by BBC Two on Christmas Eve 2010.\nTen of the BBC productions made between 1968 and 2010 (including three episodes of the Christopher Lee readings series) were released on DVD in October 2011 as a five-disc boxed set in Australia by Shock DVD, as \"The Complete Ghost Stories of M. R. James\". A boxed set of the BBC's \"Ghost Stories For Christmas\" productions, including all of the M. R. James adaptations, was released in Britain in 2012, and an expanded six-disc set (including Robert Powell's series of readings from 1986, and readings from the BBC's 1980 \"Spine Chillers\" series for children) was released in 2013.\nA new adaptation of \"The Tractate Middoth\", the directorial debut of Mark Gatiss, was broadcast on BBC Two on 25 December 2013. Gatiss also presented a new documentary, entitled \"M. R. James: Ghost Writer\", which was screened directly afterwards; it featured scenes from the BBC television adaptations, along with Robert Lloyd Parry of the Nunkie Theatre Company performing as M. R. James himself and reading excerpts from his stories.\nOn 31 October 2014, the BBC daytime soap opera \"Doctors\" presented an adaptation of \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\" with Dr Al Haskey (played by Ian Midlane) substituted for Professor Parkins. \"Whistle...\" was written by Jeremy Hylton Davies and directed by Pip Short. The BBC website also produced a behind-the-scenes video of the production.\nOn Christmas Eve 2019, the BBC broadcast an adaptation of \"Martin's Close\", written and directed by Mark Gatiss, and starring Peter Capaldi. It became BBC Four's \"most watched programme of 2019\", with 1.5 million viewers.\nIn February 2021, the BBC announced another Christmas Gatiss adaptation: \"The Mezzotint\", now promoted to appear on BBC Two.\nRadio.\n1932 \u2013 The first broadcast of an M. R. James story was made on 27 October 1932 (four years before his death) during a Bach piano concert transmitted by the BBC Midlands Regional Programme. During the 20-minute interval, \"A School Story\" was read \"from the studio\" by Vincent Curran.\n1938 \u2013 On 12 March, the BBC's London Regional Programme broadcast an adaptation of \"Martin's Close\" under the title \"Madam, Will You Walk?\" The 40-minute play was written by C. Whitaker-Wilson and produced by John Cheatle. The \"Radio Times\" printed the musical notation for the ghostly refrain and noted, \"You will have had quite enough of that tune before the play has ended. You will hear it played by a string quartet... you will hear it sung by Judge Jeffries in court (an actual fact); and, worse still, you will hear it floating on a gale of wind, sung by a murdered girl near a lonely inn in a Devonshire village. That also is a fact.\"\n1940 \u2013 The BBC broadcast a second version of \"Martin's Close\" on 4 April, this time as a 25-minute reading by John Gloag for the new Home Service.\n1946 \u2013 World War II had done nothing to dampen the BBC's enthusiasm for \"Martin's Close\", and on 13 February, C. Whitaker-Wilson's 1938 script of \"Madam, Will You Walk?\" was remounted, this time produced by Noel Iliff. Whitaker-Wilson himself played the part of Judge Jeffreys in a 45-minute production for the BBC Home Service.\nThe same year, the anthology series \"Stories Old and New\" featured David Lloyd James reading a 20-minute version of \"Lost Hearts\" for the BBC Home Service on 16 September.\n1947 \u2013 The BBC's \"Wednesday Matinee\" strand presented a version of \"The Mezzotint\", adapted by Ashley Sampson, with Martin Lewis as Dennistoun. The play was produced by John Richmond and transmitted on 21 May as the second half of a double bill, in an \"approximate\" 25-minute slot on the Home Service.\nOn 19 November, the fifteenth episode of the CBS radio series \"Escape\" was an adaptation of \"Casting the Runes\".\n1949 \u2013 \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\" became the second instalment of the new \"Man in Black\" series, arranged for radio by John Keir Cross. George Owen played Professor Parkins, Charles Lefeaux was Colonel Wilson, while Valentine Dyall starred as the eponymous host. The 30-minute play was transmitted on 7 February on the BBC Light Programme and repeated on the Home Service on 6 April.\nOn 16 June the Home Service broadcast a 15-minute reading of \"Rats\" performed by Anthony Jacobs.\n1951 \u2013 On 21 April, \"Saturday Matinee\" presented a version of \"Casting the Runes\" for the BBC Home Service. Roger Delgado appeared as Harrington, Derek Birch played Dunning and Australian actor Dodd Mehan starred as Karswell. The play was adapted by Simona Pakenham and produced by Leonarde Chase.\n1952 \u2013 \"The Uncommon Prayer Book\" was dramatised by Michael Gambier-Parry for the regional BBC Home Service West. Broadcast on 24 April, the play was billed as a \"ghost story for St. Mark's Eve\" (\"The prayer books, though repeatedly closed, are always found open at a particular psalm... above the text of this particular psalm is a quite unauthorised rubric 'For the 25th Day of April\".) The 60-minute play was produced by Owen Reed and starred George Holloway as Henry Davidson. It was repeated on 26 November on BBC Home Service Basic as part of the \"Wednesday Matinee\" strand.\n1954 \u2013 On 10 December, BBC Home Service Midland broadcast a version of \"A Warning to the Curious\", adapted by documentary maker Philip Donnellan.\n1957 \u2013 The association between M. R. James and the festive period began on Christmas Day 1957 as \"Lost Hearts\" was read by Hugh Burden on the BBC Third Programme.\n1959 \u2013 \"The Tractate Middoth\" was adapted as \"A Mass of Cobwebs\" by Brian Batchelor for the BBC's \"Thirty-Minute Theatre\". It was produced by Robin Midgley and starred Peter Howell as William Garrett, with Edgar Norfolk as Eldred. It was first broadcast on the Light Programme on 28 April 1959 and received its first repeat 59 years later on 27 August 2018 on BBC Radio 4 Extra.\n1963 \u2013 Charles Lefeaux had acted in the 1949 production of \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\", and fourteen years later he would produce three M. R. James adaptations of his own. The first of these was \"The Diary of Mr. Poynter\", an entry in the \"Mystery Playhouse\" strand for the Home Service. (\"My hair! Give me back my hair! Give me back my beautiful brown hair\" teased the Radio Times.) The 15-minute play was again adapted by Philip Donnellan and starred Marius Goring as Denton.\nLefeaux's second production was a new version of \"Martin's Close\", this time adapted by Michael and Mollie Hardwick, again for \"Mystery Playhouse\" and the Home Service. The 30-minute piece starred Donald Wolfit as Judge Jeffreys and was transmitted on 20 August 1963. (\"What see you in the corner of the Court, that you fix your eyes on it and not on me, your Judge?\" teased the Radio Times again.) The play was repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra on 26 February 2018.\nOn 18 December 1963, \"The Ash Tree\" was dramatised for \"The Black Mass\", an American anthology series broadcast on KPFA (Berkeley) and KPFK (Los Angeles). The series was produced by Eric Bauersfeld.\nThe final installment of Lefeaux's M. R. James trilogy came on Christmas Eve with another version of \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\". (\"Easy enough to whistle \u2013 but there's no telling what will answer.\") Again adapted by Michael and Mollie Hardwick, and again broadcast on the Home Service, the production is notable for the casting of Michael Hordern as Parkins \u2013 a role he would reprise for Jonathan Miller's TV adaptation five years later. The 30-minute play was repeated on BBC Radio 4 Extra on New Year's Day, 2018.\nSound effects for \"Martin's Close\" and \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\" were provided by the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, and the original sound-effects reel was preserved in their archive.\n1964 \u2013 Eric Bauersfeld's \"The Black Mass\" broadcast a second M. R. James adaptation, with \"An Evening's Entertainment\" airing on Hallowe'en Night.\n1965 \u2013 A supernaturally-themed edition of \"Story Time\" aired on the Home Service on 23 March. A number of performers read from \"stories in prose and verse\", including Scottish ballads and James's \"Wailing Well\".\n1968 \u2013 Three years later, \"Story Time\" presented five M. R. James stories read by Howieson Culff. The 30-minute episodes were produced by David Davis and broadcast weekly on BBC Radio 4 FM between 20 August and 17 September. Episodes were \"The Mezzotint\", \"The Rose Garden\", \"The Haunted Dolls' House\", \"The Uncommon Prayer-Book\" and \"A Neighbour's Landmark\". Selected episodes were repeated as \"Three Ghost Stories\" the following year.\n1971 \u2013 Radio 3's \"Study on 3\" presented a four-part analysis of \"The Horror Story\". The second episode (\"Ghosts\") was transmitted on 23 December 1971 \u2013 the day before the first \"Ghost Story for Christmas\" aired on BBC1 \u2013 and featured a discussion with Jonathan Miller and a reading of \"Lost Hearts\" by Bernard Cribbins. The series was repeated the following year.\n1974 \u2013 On 12 January, the \"CBS Radio Mystery Theater\", hosted by E. G. Marshall, presented the episode \"This Will Kill You\", which was an updated, loose adaptation of \"Casting the Runes\".\n1975 \u2013 Radio 4's \"Story Time\" presented a \"Ghost Trilogy\", broadcast over three consecutive days in December. The second edition, on 23 December, was an abridged version of \"Number 13\" read by Peter Barkworth.\n1977 \u2013 Michell Raper was a BBC producer who had already made documentaries about Peter Underwood and the London Ghost Club. On 27 December, he presented a 30-minute talk entitled \"The Ghosts of M. R. James\", which also featured readings by Gerald Cross, Norman Shelley and Kenneth Fortescue from \"Wailing Well\", \"Lost Hearts\", \"Oh, Whistle...\" and \"Rats\".\n1978 \u2013 On 2 May, the \"CBS Radio Mystery Theater\" presented \"The Figure in the Moonlight\", a loose and uncredited adaptation of \"The Mezzotint\". In Roy Winsor's script, \"The Department of Fine Arts at Wheeler College, New Hampshire, is bequeathed a collection of mostly worthless art: reproductions, some photographs, an engraving or two. Upon closer inspection, one of the items stands out for its clarity and tone: an engraving of a Victorian mansion with a flagstone path and a wide front porch. A mysterious figure seems to appear and disappear from the engraving, as if re-enacting an earlier encounter.\"\nIn the UK, the Hallowe'en edition of Radio 4's \"Forget Tomorrow's Monday\" (\"a Sunday morning miscellany\") featured Peter Underwood (president of the Ghost Club) talking \"about all things strange, from Alchemy to Zombies\", and Peter Cushing, who gave a reading of \"Lost Hearts\".\n1980 \u2013 On 19 December, \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\" became Radio 4's \"Book at Bedtime\". It was read in a 15-minute slot by Robert Trotter.\n1981 \u2013 On 2 January, BBC Radio 4 broadcast an \"Afternoon Theatre\" play called \"The Hex\", written by Gregory Evans and loosely based on \"Casting the Runes\", starring Conrad Phillips, Peter Copley, Carole Boyer and Kim Hartman. The play was subsequently transmitted, in translation, in several other countries. The 60-minute play has been repeated regularly on BBC Radio 4 Extra since December 2014.\n1982 \u2013 Radio 4 transmitted two M. R. James stories in the 15-minute \"Morning Story\" slot in 1982. \"The Rose Garden\" aired on 14 June, and \"Rats\" followed on 15 November. Both stories were read by Richard Hurndall and the series was produced by Michell \"Mitch\" Raper.\n1983 \u2013 \"Morning Story\" also produced \"The Haunted Doll's House\" [sic] on 11 February the following year. The 15-minute tale was read by David Ashford and broadcast on Radio 4 Long Wave only.\n1986 \u2013 \"Morning Story\" transmitted another reading of \"Rats\" on 9 June on BBC Radio 4. James Aubrey was the storyteller, with Mitch Raper again in the producer's chair. The 15-minute show was repeated on 7 October 2018 on Radio 4 Extra.\n1997\u201398 \u2013 After a hiatus of eleven years, M. R. James returned to the British airwaves in 1997. Running nightly from 29 December through to 2 January, \"The Late Book: Ghost Stories\" featured readings of five tales: \"Canon Alberic's Scrapbook\", \"Lost Hearts\", \"A School Story\", \"The Haunted Dolls' House\" and \"Rats\". The stories were abridged and produced by Paul Kent and read by Benjamin Whitrow. Episodes were repeated regularly on BBC 7 (Later becoming BBC Radio 7) from December 2003, then on Radio 4 Extra from 2011. According to the BBC Genome database, the episodes were originally transmitted in a 30-minute slot; however, these listings may be incomplete, as all subsequent broadcasts have been 15 minutes long.\n2000 \u2013 Radio 4's Woman's Hour Drama presented \"The Red Room\", a nine-part anthology of ghost stories by various authors, told as part of an overarching story (\"At a Christmas party, the young Rebecca West meets a mysterious stranger. Literary passions, among others, are aroused. What does it take to tell a good ghost story? A challenge is proffered, a battle of wits begins, as does a descent into dark imaginings.\") The third episode was a version of \"Casting the Runes\", with Sean Baker as Dunning, while episode five was a dramatisation of \"Count Magnus\", with Charlie Simpson as Wraxall. \"The Red Room\" was dramatised by Robin Brooks and directed by Clive Brill, and the nine 15-minute instalments were broadcast between 18 and 29 December, with several \u2013 including the M. R. James adaptations \u2013 actually listed as \"Ghost stories for Christmas\" in the \"Radio Times\".\n2006 \u2212 On 15 March, Radio 4's \"Afternoon Play\" featured \"The Midnight House\" by Jonathan Hall, a drama influenced by \"The Mezzotint\". The play was repeated on Radio 4 on 2 July 2007 and has appeared several times on Radio 4 Extra since December 2015.\n2007 \u2212 Radio 4 presented more M. R. James adaptations in the form of \"M.R. James at Christmas\", a series of five plays in the \"Woman's Hour Drama\" slot. Stories adapted were \"Oh, Whistle, and I'll Come to You, My Lad\" starring Jamie Glover as Professor Parkins, \"The Tractate Middoth\" with Joseph Mlllson as Garrett and John Rowe as Eldred, \"Lost Hearts\" with Peter Marinker as Abney, \"The Rose Garden\" with Anton Lesser as George and Carolyn Pickles as Mary, and \"Number 13\" with Julian Rhind-Tutt as Dr Anderson. The plays were adapted by Chris Harrald and directed and produced by Gemma Jenkins. Each episode was introduced by Derek Jacobi as James himself. The series ran from Christmas Eve to 28 December, culminating in an original Jamesian drama, \"A Warning to the Furious\". The episodes were released on CD as \"Spine Chillers\" by BBC Audio in 2008. They were repeated on BBC 7 in December 2009 and (under the title \"M. R. James Stories\") on Radio 4 Extra in 2011 and 2018.\nThese plays would be the last M. R. James radio adaptations for some time. Although repeats of older plays continued on BBC 7 and Radio 4 Extra, it would be more than 10 years before any new dramatisations were produced.\n2009 \u2212 The series \"Classic Tales of Horror\" included a reading of \"The Mezzotint\" delivered by Robin Bailey. The episode was transmitted on BBC Radio 7 on 9 October 2009 and repeated on 20 May the following year.\n2011 \u2212 Radio 3's \"Twenty Minutes,\" an \"eclectic arts magazine programme\", featured a version of \"A Warning to the Curious\" on 13 June. The twenty-minute reading was by Alex Jennings, and the script produced and abridged by Justine Willett.\n2018 \u2013 \"Woman's Hour Drama\" had broadcast the last M. R. James dramatisations before the hiatus. The slot was subsequently rebranded as \"15-Minute Drama\", and in 2018 introduced a new series, \"The Haunting of M. R. James\". \"Five of the most powerful tales by this master of the ghost story\" were adapted by Neil Brand: \"The Mezzotint\", \"Casting The Runes\", \"The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral\", \"A Warning to the Curious and \"Rats\". As had happened in 2007, the five adaptations were followed by an original drama, this time entitled \"The Haunting of M.R. James\". The series aired daily from 17 to 21 December and was directed by David Hunter.\nAlso on 21 December, a series apparently entitled \"Classic Stories: Tales for Christmas\" was uploaded to BBC Sounds. The episodes included a reading of \"The Mezzotint\" performed by Sam Dale and produced by Justine Willett. The provenance of this series is something of a mystery as it appears to never have been broadcast prior to its appearance online.\n2019 \u2013 Another website-only production was added to BBC Sounds\u00a0on 21 June. The 25-minute reading of \"Wailing Well\" was performed by Joseph Ayre and produced as part of \"Classic Stories: Stories for Summer\" by Julian Wilkinson.\nThe second radio adaptation of the year arrived in the form of \"Ghost Stories from Ambridge\", a spin-off from \"The Archers\". The second episode, which aired on Radio 4 on New Year\u2019s Eve, was a reading of \"Lost Hearts\" (\"on a biting December night, in the darkened attic of Lower Loxley, Jim Lloyd enthrals an assembly of Ambridge residents with three chilling ghost stories from the turn of the last century\", teased the BBC webpage.) John Rowe played narrator Jim Lloyd and the 14-minute script was abridged by Jeremy Osborne.\nOther audio productions.\nIn the 1980s, a series of four double audio cassettes was released by Argo Records, featuring nineteen unabridged James stories narrated by Michael Hordern. The tapes were titled \"Ghost Stories\" (1982), \"More Ghost Stories\" (1984), \"A Warning to the Curious\" (1985) and \"No. 13 and Other Ghost Stories\" (1988). ISIS Audio Books also released two collections of unabridged James stories, this time narrated by Nigel Lambert. These tapes were titled \"A Warning to the Curious and Other Tales\" (four audio cassettes, six stories, March 1992) and \"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\" (three audio cassettes, eight stories, December 1992).\nIn Spring 2007 UK-based Craftsman Audio Books released the first complete set of audio recordings of James's stories on CD, spread across two volumes and read by David Collings. The ghost story author Reggie Oliver acted as consultant on the project.\nApril 2007 also saw the release of \"Tales of the Supernatural\", Volume One, an audiobook presentation by Fantom Films, featuring the James stories \"Lost Hearts\" read by Geoffrey Bayldon, \"Rats\" and \"Number 13\" by Ian Fairbairn, with Gareth David-Lloyd reading \"Casting the Runes\" and \"There Was a Man Dwelt by a Churchyard\". Volume Two was to follow in the summer.\nAlso in 2007, BBC Audio released \"Ghost Stories Volume One\" (including \"A View from a Hill\", \"Rats\", \"A School Story\", \"The Ash Tree\", and \"The Story of a Disappearance and an Appearance\") read by Derek Jacobi. \"Ghost Stories Volume Two\" followed in 2009 (including \"A Warning to the Curious'\" \"The Stalls of Barchester Cathedral\"', \"The Mezzotint\", and \"A Neighbour's Landmark\"').\nAs of 2010 the audiobooks site LibriVox offers a set of audio readings (available as free downloads) under the collective heading \"Ghost Stories of an Antiquary\".\nA full-cast audio dramatization of \"Casting the Runes\" was distributed by Audible in 2019. With a contemporary setting, it was scripted by Stephen Gallagher and featured Tom Burke (actor) and Anna Maxwell Martin, with Reece Shearsmith in the role of Karswell.\nin 2020, a full cast, audio adaptation of \"Oh, Whistle And I'll Come To You, My Lad\" was produced under the title \"Whistle\" by White Heron Theatre of Nantucket, Massachusetts. It was written and directed by Mark Shanahan with original audio production and music by John Gromada. The audio drama bears a contemporary setting and was set on Nantucket Island. Though it deviates from the source material in many aspects, it retains the original's core traits. The cast includes Steve Pacek Alexandra Kopko and Catherine Shanahan. The audio drama was broadcast on Nantucket's NPR affiliate station, WNCK, on October 31, 2020.\nFilm.\nThe only notable film version of James's work to date has been the 1957 British adaptation of \"Casting the Runes\" by Jacques Tourneur, titled \"Night of the Demon\" (known as \"Curse of the Demon\" in the US), starring Dana Andrews, Peggy Cummins and Niall MacGinnis. \"The Brides of Dracula\" (Terence Fisher, 1960) lifts the padlocked coffin scene from \"Count Magnus\", while Michele Soavi's 1989 film \"The Church\"\u2014featuring a script co-authored by Dario Argento\u2014borrows the motif of the \"stone with seven eyes\", as well as a few other important details, from \"The Treasure of Abbot Thomas\". \nA new film adaptation of \"Casting the Runes\" was announced in 2013 by director Joe Dante. It was to be a modernised reimagining of the story, with James's character Dunning portrayed as a celebrity blogger, and Karswell as a successful motivational speaker and self-help guru with connections to the occult. Simon Pegg was attached to star. The film has yet to go into production.\nStage.\nThe first stage version of \"Casting the Runes\" was performed at the Carriageworks Theatre in Leeds, England, on 9\u201310 June 2006 by the Pandemonium Theatre Company.\nIn 2006\u20132007 Nunkie Theatre Company toured \"A Pleasing Terror\" round the UK and Ireland. This one-man show was a retelling of two of James's tales, \"Canon Alberic's Scrap-Book\" and \"The Mezzotint\".

{"title": "Mersha_Nahusenay", "label": "Writer", "text": "Mersha Nahusenay ( 1850 \u2013 1937) was a reformist and pioneer of change who made important contributions to the modernization and independence of Ethiopia. One of the closest advisors to Emperor Menelik II, he went on to become the first governor of Dire Dawa, and surrounding areas (1902\u20131905). Prior to that he was governor of the strategic and frontier district of Jaldessa (Gildessa) and its environ where he also held the position of head of customs. His public career lasted over three decades from the era of Menelik II (referred to in historical records as Menilek) until the reign of Haile Selassie. He was one of the most recognized Ethiopians of his time. He knew the French language and was open to European ideas and way of life earning him admiration abroad. His most enduring legacy was the construction, maintenance and security of the first railway which he oversaw at the request of the emperor. Mersha belongs to a generation who took advantage of the relative stability of the late 19th \u2013 early 20th century to implement a series of wide-ranging political, economic and social reforms which put the country on the path to modernization ushering in a new era.\nEarly life.\nChildhood and Formative Years.\nAto (Mr.) Mersha Nahusenay (\u12a0\u1276 \u1218\u122d\u123b \u1293\u1201\u1220\u1293\u12ed) was born about 1850 near the town of Ankober, the former capital of Shewa.\nAccording to oral history, Mersha came from a family of priests. His parents were strict followers of the Ethiopian Orthodox faith and religion played a central role in their life. Mersha's childhood was hence heavily influenced by events involving the Church where he was also baptized. Family lore further indicates that his father owned a land given to him in return for the service he rendered to the church. In addition to holding lands, churches at the time received considerable assistance from the royal palace which they then used to provide key services to their members and communities, including the education of children. Thus Mersha was taught reading and writing at an early age and received traditional church education. Whether or not he had any siblings remains unknown although the name Mersha in the Amharic language implies a desire to forget a traumatic experience such as the loss of a previous child.\nGrowing up, Mersha spent a great deal of time on the farm with his parents. He traveled to various places within Shewa and beyond allowing him to interact with a diverse group of people and explore opportunities which existed for a career in a secular field. For example, early on he learned to appreciate the importance local as well as foreign languages. Beyond these sketchy details, little is known about Mersha's early life at this point. It is unclear, for example, if he had royal ancestry. The fact that he was later married to the daughter of one of Menelik's trusted servants suggests, however, that the family had close ties to the palace.\nOverall there is little doubt that Mersha's formative and early adulthood experiences helped him prepare for his long and illustrious public career. It's worth noting that today Ankober is one of many districts (woredas) of Ethiopia. But back then, it was the capital of one of several powerful kingdoms. The following quote encapsulates the vitality of the Ankober area at the time:\nThe early nineteenth-century Shawan royal capital of Ankober was a spectacular sight, \u2018perched at 2400 meters atop a volcanic cone above the steep escarpment of the eastern highlands\u2019. It commanded a prosperous, cosmopolitan and culturally diverse polity. Founded as a frontier outpost in the late-eighteenth century, fifty years later Ankober stood amidst a rich agricultural area and controlled the Red Sea trade through regional markets such as Aliyu Amba. Visited by Muslim merchants and traders from the Mediterranean, and a busy ecclesiastical base of Orthodox theology, Ankober was a lively commercial and intellectual center.\nBy mid-19th century, Ankober had established trade and diplomatic ties with the outside world. As a result, there was strong public interest in international affairs, foreign languages, history, geography and medicine, as well as the design, manufacturing and function of machines and tools as documented by missionaries. \nUnder Menelik, the last ruler of Shewa (1865\u20131889), Ankober rapidly evolved into a vibrant political and economic center. Trade was expanded to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea via Harar.\nMersha also grew up in one of the most consequential periods in the nation's history. The second half of the nineteenth century was a turning point in the sense that it marked the end a long period of deep divisions within and between the various kingdoms located in the northern part of the country known as the Era of Princes or Zemene Mesafint (1769\u20131855). Emperor Tewodros (Tewodros II) was the first ruler (1855\u20131868) in the modern era to try and unify the northern kingdoms. Included in Tewodros' vision also was the introduction of European-style civilization. His efforts were cut short however by internal resistance and external challenges as well as his untimely death. Emperor Yohannes (Yohannes IV) further pursued the unification agenda during his reign (1872\u20131889), but he was unfortunately killed in a war with Mahdist Sudan. Emperor Menelik II (1889\u20131913), his successor, the fortunate one to realize the dreams of his predecessors and much more. He succeeded in bringing together, under a central authority, northern and southern territories. Through a combination of diplomacy and military campaigns, he was able to create a new empire paving the way for the emergence of modern Ethiopia.\nMenelik's extraordinary achievements, including his leadership in the decisive victory over Italy at Adwa, in 1896, enabled him to put the country on the path to stability and modernization. According to the prominent Ethiopian historian Tekletsadiq Mekuria, Menelik's top priorities included: negotiating Ethiopia's borders with the three European colonial powers (i.e., France, Britain and Italy) who controlled much of Eastern Africa; securing access to the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea as a way of improving trade relations with Europe and beyond; maintaining security and stability across the vast empire; implementing wide-ranging political, economic and social reforms; and building Ethiopia's image abroad.\nAs will be seen below, Mersha was at the forefront of most, if not all, of these undertakings. He answered repeated calls for public service and rose to the occasion by taking on challenging tasks. More importantly, he was a strong advocate for reform and European-style modernization. The renowned Ethiopian historian Tekletsadiq Mekuria wrote in his book \"Atse Menilek and the Unity of Ethiopia\":\n\u1235\u1208\u12da\u1205 \u12d0\u1344 \u121d\u1292\u120d\u12ad \u12e8\u1290\u12da\u1205\u1295\u1293 \u12e8\u12cd\u132d \u12a0\u1308\u122d \u1270\u12c8\u120b\u1305 \u12a0\u121b\u12ab\u122a\u12ce\u127d \u121d\u12ad\u122d \u1260\u1218\u1235\u121b\u1275 \u12a5\u12cd\u132d \u12a0\u1308\u122d \u12f0\u122d\u1230\u12cd \u1218\u1320\u1290\u129b \u12a5\u12cd\u1240\u1275 \u12a5\u12e8\u1240\u1230\u1219 \u12e8\u1270\u1218\u1208\u1231\u1275\u1295 \u12e8\u1290\u130d\u122b\u12dd\u121b\u127d \u12ec\u1234\u134d\u1295\u1364 \u12e8\u1290\u1290\u130b\u12f5\u122b\u1235 \u12d8\u12cd\u1308\u1295\u1364 \u12e8\u12a5\u1290 \u12a0\u1276 \u12a0\u1325\u121c\u1295\u1364 \u12e8\u1290 \u12a0\u1276 \u1218\u122d\u123b \u1293\u1201 \u1220\u1293\u12ed\u1295\u1364 \u12e8\u1290 \u1265\u120b\u1273 \u1308\u1265\u1228 \u12a5\u130d\u12da\u12a0\u1265\u1214\u122d\u1295\u1364 \u12e8\u1290 \u12a8\u1295\u1272\u1263 \u1308\u1265\u1229\u1295\u1364 \u12e8\u1290\u12a0\u1208\u1243 \u1273\u12e8\u1295\u1364 \u12e8\u1290 \u1290\u130b\u12f5\u122b\u1235 \u1308\u1265\u1228 \u1215\u12ed\u12c8\u1275 \u1263\u12ed\u12a8\u12f3\u129d\u1295\u1364 \u12e8\u1290 \u12a0\u1276 \u1280\u12ed\u1208 \u121b\u122d\u12eb\u121d \u1235\u122b\u1265\u12ee\u1295\u1295\u1364 \u12a0\u1235\u1270\u12eb\u12e8\u1275 \u1260\u121b\u12f3\u1218\u1325 \u1260\u12a0\u1308\u122b\u1278\u12cd \u12e8\u12a0\u12cd\u122e\u1353\u1295 \u1225\u120d\u1323\u1294 \u1208\u121b\u1235\u1308\u1263\u1275 \u1273\u1325\u1240\u12cd \u1270\u1290\u1221\u1362\nEnglish translation: \nThus, after listening to the advice of these and other personal foreign advisors and taking into account the views of those who had travelled abroad and returned with limited knowledge such as Grazmach Yosef, Negaddras Zewge, Ato Atsme, Ato Mersha Nahusenay, Blata Gebre Egziabher, Kentiba Gebru, Aleqa Taye, Negadras Gebre Hiwot Baykedagn and Ato Hailemariam Serabyo, Atse Menelik decided to introduce European civilization to his country.\nLater life.\nWhether Mersha Nahusenay held any official government positions before Menelik II became Emperor of Ethiopia in 1889 remains unknown. What is evident from historical records is sometime in the early 1890s, at the age of about 40, he left his birthplace and settled in the Harar province. By then, Ankober had declined in part due to the rise of Addis Abeba (Addis Ababa), as the new capital of Ethiopia founded in 1886 by Menelik and his influential wife Empress Taytu Betul (1851\u20131918).\nGovernor of Jaldessa and Head of Imperial Customs.\nMersha's relocation to Harar marked the beginning of his long and distinguished career. By some accounts as early as 1892, but surely by 1895, he was appointed governor of Jaldessa (Gildessa, Jildessa, Guildessa, Gheldessa), a historic and strategic district near the present city of Harar. According to one source., at the time, Jaldessa had approximately 6,000 inhabitants at the time compared to 8,000 in the port city of Djibouti and 30,000 in Harar. Not only was Jaldessa a frontier town to Menelik's empire, but it was also located along an important caravan route connecting Ethiopia with the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea coast. As a result, all visitors were required to pass through an armed and customs post established there by the Ethiopian authority and administered by Mersha. As chief of customs, Jaldessa Mersha oversaw the import of all goods. Caravans were stopped and inspected. Import duty of 10 per cent was levied on merchandise generating important revenue for the empire. The economic value of Jaldessa grew considerably after the port of Djibouti became operational. However, it sharply declined following the founding of Dire Dawa, in 1902.\nAs governor, Mersha controlled and administered a vast area between Ethiopian borders with the French and British Somalilands and the Awash River. The territory was inhabited by Somalis, Oromos, Afars and other ethnic groups. He served under Ras Mekonnen Woldemichael (Makonnen Wolde Mikael), who was governor of Harar Province until his untimely death in 1906. The Armenian Serkis Terzian (1868\u20131915) served as governor of Jaldessa before him. Terzian, a personality well known to scholars of Ethiopian history, served Menelik in various capacities, including the import of arms and ammunition. Apparently, there was confusion at times about who owned what. On one occasion, Mersha confiscated arms claimed by Terzian, according to distinguished historian Richard Pankhurst. Lord Hindlip, a British businessman and adventurer and a member of an Anglo-American expedition, described his visit to Mersha's residence as follows:\nHe received us in his official residence, a small circular hut with the usual pointed roof, built on a conical hill. His furniture consisted of a table, chair, two beds, a photograph of an Abyssinian priest, and a coloured Crucification, while his rifle, shield, and revolver were hung on the walls.\nFurthermore, Jaldessa was at the center of international negotiations between Menelik and the three colonial powers. Article 3 of the 1897 treaty signed between Britain and Ethiopia, for example, stated that the route between Zeyla (Zeila) and Harar via Gildessa should remain open for the commercial interests of the two countries. Mersha was regularly consulted on relevant matters. He was also directly responsible for implementation of agreements. For instance, in 1896, he hosted Cyrille Macaire (Kyrillos Makarios), a coptic Egyptian bishop who came as a special envoy of Pope Leo XIII to plead with Menelik to free the Italian prisoners from the battle of Adwa. When the prisoners were freed ultimately, they were brought to an area near Gildessa to meet with an Italian Red Cross team before being transported to Harar for safe return to Italy. Mersha visited Djibouti on several occasions, including at the request of Emperor Menelik. His knowledge of French was invaluable during his foreign trips.\nPromoter of the progressive image of Ethiopia.\nFollowing the victory at Adwa (1896), there was a heightened global interest in strengthening diplomatic and trade relations with Ethiopia. A large number of foreign nationals, including diplomats, journalists, writers, scientists and explorers visited the empire. The visitors were intrigued by Menelik's wisdom and accomplishments. Realizing the significance of the moment for the future, the emperor was equally determined to build a progressive image of his nation. What better place to create a good first impression than the frontier town of Jaldessa? Lord Edward Gleichen, the British courtier, officer and author who visited Ethiopia in 1897 and who was a member of Sir Rennell Rodd's diplomatic mission wrote the following:\nNext day we made a long march of twenty-four miles over stony country to Garasle, a pretty little river, three inches deep, running between high banks, and a three hours' march on the following morning brought us to Gildessa. Here we were received in great state by the governor, one Aito Merzha (i.e., Ato Mersha), who, to impress on us that we were now on Abyssinian territory, had turned out a guard of about a dozen men, all armed with rifles and carrying the Abyssinian flag. The latter, I fear, did not impress us much, as it only consisted of triangular yellow, red, and green pennons nailed on a thin and crooked stick; but the guard of honour was very beautiful.\nMost visitors came to the country through the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea and many camped at Jaldessa for at least a day before traveling further to Addis Abeba, Harar or other parts of the new empire. Thus, Mersha was tasked with providing logistical and other forms of assistance to the guests. He was uniquely positioned to meet and interact with a large number of Europeans and other foreign nationals. In an article published in \"Le Figaro\" (April 1901), the French journalist and author Hughes Le Roux noted the following after a long discussion with Mersha.\n\"Je ne sais si ce sage a lu Candide, mais depuis les ann\u00e9es d\u00e9j\u00e0 longues que le Roi des rois lui a confi\u00e9 la clef de la premi\u00e8re poterne de l'empire, il a vu d\u00e9filer beaucoup d'hommes de toutes couleurs, de tous pays, de toutes langues\".\nEnglish translation:\nI do not know if this wise man read Candide, but since for many years the King of Kings has given him the key to the first gate of the empire, he had seen people of all colors, all countries, and all languages.\nThe following is a partial list of notables who have either interacted with or hosted by Mersha at Gildessa or Dire Dawa:\nDespite robust diplomatic efforts by Menelik and his domestic as well as foreign advisors, there was a great deal of skepticism initially among many Europeans that Ethiopia was ready to embrace modernization. In an article titled \"The Menelik Myth\", published in 1899, for example, vicomte Edmond de Poncins, the wealthy French naturalist and explorer, concluded:\nThe history of Ethiopia, then, may be summed up thus: a country in which communications are difficult, peopled by a multiplicity of races; its internal life presents ever the same cycle of wars, victories, defeats, its external life the same blank. A real civilization is impossible in that black chaos, and the products of civilization, such as agriculture, invention, commerce, do not exist.\nIn contrast, there were those who offered unwavering support for the expansion of trade and investment in Ethiopia. Menelik's closest European advisors such as the Swiss engineer [[Alfred Ilg]] and the French trader Leon Chefneux (\u201cchief commerce advisor\u201d) were incontestably at the top of the list. Mersha worked closely with both of them. But there were others as well. Casimir Mondon-Vidailhet, the French journalist and contributor to the \"[[Le Temps]]\", was another important figure who played a major role in advancing Ethio-French relations. Due to his passion for horticulture, Mondon-Vidailhet may have also played a role in popularizing the eucalyptus tree (\u12e8\u1263\u1215\u122d \u12db\u134d). He also studied local languages (e.g. Amharic, Guraghe, Harari, etc.) and wrote books about them. More relevantly, Mondon-Vidailhet helped advance the progressive image of Menelik and Ethiopia in Europe and the United States. He did this primarily through his speeches and writings. In an interview that he gave to \"[[The New York Times]]\", in 1898, Mondon defended Ethiopia's records and potential:\nThe country lends itself easily to civilization, and its organization, still encumbered by feudal relations, tends more and more to become modelled on the lines of European constitutional monarchies. Menelek, powerful and respected, an enlightened reformer and administrator, who abolished slavery in his dominions, and dislikes fanatics to whatever sect they belong, has revealed himself as a really great sovereign, worthy of admiration by his conduct, as well as by the dignity of his character.\nMersha was a strong proponent of opening Ethiopia to the world. He encouraged 'modern' education and supported missionary schools in Harar. He encouraged trade ties with Europe, particularly France, Ethiopia's major strategic ally at the time. The French government awarded Mersha the El-Anouar Nishan in April 1905.\n[[File:French Government award to Mersha - April 1905.jpg|300px|thumbnail|The \"Legion d'Honneur\" order given to Mersha in April 1905]]\nHead of the first railway construction.\nThe first and most significant example of European direct investment in Ethiopia was the construction of Ethiopia's first railway. The agreement to create a company for the construction of the railroad was first signed in 1894 between Menelik and [[Alfred Ilg]]. The primary European stakeholder was obviously France although British investors also owned shares and bonds at least until 1902 which is when the line reached Addis-Harar, later renamed Dire Dawa.\n[[File:The first Ethiopian train Anbessa.gif|thumbnail|Ethiopia's first train Anbessa]]\nMersha was a key figure in the negotiations, construction and security of the railway during the initial phases of the project (1897\u20131911). When the Djibouti railroad reached the Ethiopian border town of [[Dewele]] (Dawale), in July 1900, he represented the emperor at the inaugural ceremony attended by a delegation of the French government led by [[:fr:Gabriel Angoulvant|Gabriel Louis Angoulvant]], acting governor-general of the [[French Somaliland]] as well representatives of shareholders and other domestic and foreign diplomats, including Ato Yosef Zagalan, the Ethiopian consul in Djibouti and a dear friend of Mersha. According to one source, emperor Menelik himself was to be present, but he changed his mind later in protest of the growing interference by the French government in the affairs of the Compagnie Imperiale d'Ethiopie to which he granted concession. Things became worse and the construction was interrupted for several years following the completion of the Djibouti-Dire Dawa line. When the work resumed in 1909, Mersha was once again called to serve. The task given to him and other local officials was to oversee the extension of the meter-gauge line up to Awash. The railway reached Addis Abeba only in 1917. By then emperor Menelik had died and his daughter Zewditu was head of the empire.\n[[File:Menilek letter to Mersha.jpg|300px|thumbnail|Emperor Menelik's letter to Mersha, written in December 1908]]\nEnglish translation of Menelik's letter to Mersha: \nDear Ato Mersha. How have you been? I, thank God, am well. Since the French railway companies informed me that they would resume construction, I would like you to manage the work in consultation with Negadras Yigezu. Written in the city of Debre Libanos on the 2nd day of Tahsas 1901.\n(*The above letter has been included in the recent book titled 'Emperor Menilek's Domestic Letters' as letter #1898 (Paulos Gnogno collections); Aster Nega Publishers; 2010 p.\u00a0517).\nThe historian Richard Pankhurst called the first railway \u201cthe country\u2019s greatest technological achievement of the period.\u201d It led to rapid expansion of domestic and foreign trade. By cutting the amount of travel time to the coast in half, for example, the railroad increased the import and export of commodities drastically. It accelerated the process of urbanization as it paved the way to the rise of new settlements and villages and transformation of towns such as Harar and Addis Abeba. The movement of people from south to north and vice versa grew considerably. In short, the railway made life better for hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Ethiopians. More importantly, it connected the country to the sea. Robert P Skinner, the diplomat who led the first US mission, in 1903\u201304, noted the following about the importance of the railway to the economy\nThe custom-house figures show a movement of importations and exportations in 1902 amounting $1,659,800, but, having in mind the methods of appraisement and the possibility of entering goods in contraband, it may be conservatively stated that the total trade under present conditions amounts to $3,000,000 per annum. Henceforth, this trade will grow rapidly, although the full power of the country will not be appreciated until the railroad is extended to the capital, 300 miles distant from its present terminus.\nSpinner further observed: \nWhen the railroad connecting the Empire and the sea was projected, a route was naturally selected which should give the greatest advantages to commerce...A town was created at this point, to which was given the name Dire Douah, and it has already become an important business center...\nPioneer and the first governor of Dire Dawa.\nThe conclusion of the Djibouti-Dire Dawa railway, in 1902, marked the birth of [[Dire Dawa]], the second largest city in Ethiopia. Shortly after, Mersha was ordered to move the [[Jaldessa]] custom house and his residence to the new terminus making him the first governor of the railway city. Not only he was at the right place at the right time, but this was a natural extension of his administrative responsibilities. Getahun Mesfin Haile, an expert on the history of Dire Dawa wrote:\nBefore the foundation of the town, the whole frontier region up to Dawale including the great environ of Dire Dawa used to be administered by a governor whose seat normally was at Jeldessa, a few km to the east of Dire Dawa. In 1902 the Governor was one Mersha Nahusenay, an educated and also French speaking personality, who took a considerable part in the foundation of the station and eventually of the town.\nHe went on to say;\nThe earliest town quarters of K\u00e4zira and M\u00e4gala, which sprang up following the establishment by the railway company of a station and its main workshop, soon evolved into the two most important nodes of economic, social and administrative activities of the new town. K\u00e4zira was built according to a regular plan and well provided with modern amenities. In the meantime, Ato M\u00e4rsha Nahus\u00e4nay, the first governor, and his followers, cleared and settled an area of land across from K\u00e4zira on the opposite side of the D\u00e4chatu that was largely covered with dense brush and cacti then. Growing out of this nucleus the larger quarter of M\u00e4gala took shape by degrees. In fact, the present quarter of D\u00e4chatu used to be known as G\u00e4nd\u00e4-M\u00e4rsha in the past in honor of its illustrious resident and founder.\nThus, it didn't take long before residential communities appeared and roads, offices and workshops as well as other critical facilities were built under the leadership of Leon Chefneux and Mersha. In the first several years of its founding, residents of the new town and the Franco-Ethiopian railway company were able to lay the foundation for what later became a French-style, cosmopolitan city. Sadly, unlike other towns, foreigners and locals did not live in the same area. Kezira or Gezira became a European quarter while Megala was inhabited by natives.\nRichard Pankhurst called Dire Dawa \u201cEthiopia\u2019s first modern town\". Not only Dire Dawa was built differently than other towns of the time, but its administration was also unique. Historian Shiferaw Bekele noted:\nThe officials shared certain important characteristics which sharply set them apart from the general run of Ethiopian officialdom at the time\u2026 Almost in every province, one would meet one or two men who belonged to this category. However, in no other much concentration as in Dire Dawa.\nShiferaw, who is an expert on the early history of Dire Dawa, went on to say: \nThe Dire Dawan officialdom invariably spoke at least one European language. Even the earliest, Mersha, spoke French. A good number of them were highly educated. Afework Gebre Yesus and Gebre Hiwot Baykedagn who were the directors of Customs had had long years of stay in Europe where they had attained a tertiary level education. Beshah Wured was educated in the United States. The rest had gone to Mission schools.\nMersha served as governor from 1902 until 1906. He was in charge of administrative as well as judicial affairs. He even held courts \"under a tree\" in the early years of his tenure. He was succeeded by Ato Negatu Gugsa. The Dire Dawa municipality did not emerge until sometime between 1915 and 1920.\nChief of railway security.\nThe agreements signed by the Ethiopian government and the railway company required Ethiopia to deploy a police force to safeguard the line and safety of employees. The mission was extremely dangerous due to local hostilities. Mersha became head of railway security full-time in 1906. His strategy for success included working with local chiefs and leaders. In fact he also assumed the position of chief of the Issa territory which much of the opposition to the construction came from. Shiferaw Bekele wrote:\nAs the governor of the province through with the line passed, he (i.e. Ato Mersha) was responsible for the peace and security of the line. He posted detachments of troops all along the line. He carried out negotiations with all the important chiefs of the Afar and Somali tribes in the region. He received orders from Ras Mekonnen and from Menelik.\nHe was in charge of the recruitment, training of the security personnel; negotiated their wage with the company; and settled disputes. He had always been the middle man between the railway company and Ethiopians. That involved making sure that the company honored its contractual obligations as well. As early as September 1900, for example, Mr. J. Gerolimato, the British consul agent in Harar, sent the following message to his boss, James Hayes Sadler, the Consul-General of the British-Somaliland:\nDear Sir: BEFORE yesterday, Atto Marcha, Governor of Jildessa, who was in Jibuti arrived here. There were in Daranli (i.e., Dawale) 200 Abyssinians to protect the line against the Essa (i.e., Issa), the Company paying 12 dollars per month for each Abyssinian soldier; now the Company paid them 8 dollars, instead of 12 dollars, and the Abyssinians have withdrawn these 200 men.\nHis prior experience as chief of Harar police must have prepared him for the challenges of the position The railway police was in charge of stability and peace Dire Dawa and its surroundings as well. which he held until the mid-1920s with the exception of his brief dismissal by Lij Iyasu in 1916.\nThe Dawn of Modernization.\nThe desire to introduce European style modernization was not unique to Emperor [[Menelik II]]. However, it was under him that the country took important practical steps in terms of establishing modern institutions and structure of governance. Transport and communication got a huge boost. The first telephone and telegraph were introduced following the first railway. Major roads were built and bicycles and automobiles appeared for the first time. The tax system was restructured. A modern monetary system was created. The first bank (Bank of Abyssinia) was established. A national currency was launched. The governance system underwent significant reorganization. The first cabinet of ministers was formed. Each of the six districts had two judges appointed by Menelik himself. The position of a supreme judge was created. The first public schools; the first newspaper, the first hotels, the first hospitals and post offices emerged. The list goes on. Although Mersha was principally involved in the construction of the railway and establishment of \"modern\" customs, he also participated in other important reforms such as the creation of postal and telegraph services.\nAfter Menelik died in 1913, following a long illness, his grandson [[Iyasu V]] became the de facto ruler. Mersha was about sixty years of age at the time.\nDuring his brief reign (1913\u20131916), Iyasu seems to have continued some of the reforms that he inherited. However, he also made political miscalculations resulting in his removal from power. In 1915, for example, Iyasu appointed [[Hasib Ydlibi]] (or Idlibi), a Syrian merchant of Turkish citizenship, as governor of Dire Dawa and Neggadras of Harar. The appointment was kept secret from Dejazmach Teferi (Tafari) Mekonnen, his cousin and governor of Harar Province. \nBut then in July 1916, a few months before his ouster, Iyasu took the unprecedented step of deposing Teferi from his governorship creating further tensions between them and leading to anger in a province traditionally governed by that family.\nIyasu also seem to have chosen a foreign policy which sought to alienate traditional allies such as France and strengthen relations with Germany and Turkey (then Ottoman Empire). Perhaps because of that, he went on to remove Mersha from his post at the railway and replace him with Abubakar Mahammad, another important historic figure in Ethiopian history. Ironically, just months before their dismissal, both Dejach Teferi and Mersha had accompanied Iyasu during his trip to the region along with a number of other notables, including Mikael Berru (a German educated, British agency interpreter and father of the Sorbonne graduate Lij [[Seifu Mikael]]) and Tesemma Eshete. The radical changes were quickly picked up by foreign media.\nThe sudden change was picked up by international media and largely interpreted as a plan to favor Muslims over Christians, a sentiment shared by many in the country.\nSuddenly, at the end of last July, Yasu left Adis Abeba for Harrar and came on to Jibuti on August 8th, where he renewed his protestations of friendship to M. Simoni, Governor of French Somaliland ... He was found to have deposed Prince Taffari, son of Ras Makonnen, from the Governorship of Harrar and substituted a Muhammadan... Intrigue was rampant at Harrar under the Turk Ydlibi; and finally the chief of the Issas, Ato Marcha, was deposed in favour of a Muhammadan. These events caused a stir at Adis Abeba. The legations of the Entente Powers also sent in a protest. And on September 27th...Lij Yasu was formally deposed.\nThe situation, however, was much more complex than what the reports claimed. There is no doubt that Iyasu tried to nurture close relations with the Muslim community and was married Fatima, the daughter of Abubakar, raising questions about his intentions and vision. Abubakar came from a family of rich Muslim Afar traders who made enormous contributions to Menelik commercially, administratively and diplomatically. His father, Mahammad (also Negaddras) was the governor of the historic town of Aliyu Amba (Shoa Province) while he himself served as the governor of Shenno, another commercial center. His grandfather, Abubakar Ibrahim Chehem, was a notable statesman and Sultan or Pasha of Somalia's port city of Zeila (Zeyla) before it became part of the British Somaliland.\nIn contrast, some scholars argue today that the new policies were all part of Iyasu's efforts to consolidate the imperial power such as by integrating marginal territories such as the Afar land.\nFrom the end of the 19th century, the members of this family lost their role as obligatory intermediaries in favour of European traders supported by their respective states. However, one of them, Naggadras Mahammad Abubakar, continued to enjoy the trust of Menelik, who was unwilling to rely solely on the Europeans.\n Furthermore, although Mersha was Christian, he did not adhere to the historically dominant Orthodox faith. Rather he was one of the first to convert to Catholicism and subjected to mistreament like many of his fellow worshippers.\nMersha's absence was a source of great concern to the railway company in part due to his long and dedicated service and reputation. This was obvious from one of the letters that Emperor Menelik wrote to him. The following comment made by Mr. de Maz\u00e9rieux, the company's administrator, captures that sentiment:\n\"Avec Ato Marcha, qui \u00e9tait au courant des usages et des m\u00e9thodes de la Cie, et qui lui \u00e9tait surtout absolumment d\u00e9vou\u00e9, les difficult\u00e9s etaient rapidement aplanies. Abou-Baker est trop connu en Abyssinie et \u00e0 la Cie, pour qu\u2019on puisse esp\u00e9rer, qu\u2019il en sera de m\u00eame avec lui.\"\nEnglish translation: \nWith Ato Marcha, who was very knowledgeable of the practices and methods of CIE (i.e., Compagnie Imperiale d\u2019Ethiopie), and who was absolutely devoted, difficulties were quickly resolved. Abu-Baker is very well known in Abyssinia and Cie, so we hope that things will be the same with him.\nMersha was restored to his position under [[Empress Zewditu]], Menelik's daughter, who ruled Ethiopia from 1916 until 1930. Teferi Mekonnen was regent to the throne during this period and went on to rule Ethiopia as Emperor Haile Selassie I(1930\u20131974) when the empress died.\nA prominent Catholic.\nMersha was a well-known Catholic. He played an important role in the spread of the faith in Harar region and beyond. His wife Tedeneqyalesh was the daughter of Ato Mekbeb (also Mekev, Makeb and Makbeb) who was converted to Catholicism in the late 1860s by the Italian missionary Cardinal Guglielmo Massaja or Abba Messias as he was known in Ethiopia. Martial De Salviac, the French missionary who lived in Ethiopia at the end of the 19th century, wrote the following: \nThe one which Menelik called 'a man of my confidence', that was Ato Makeb, officer of the royal house. He soon earned the confidence of missionaries by becoming an edified Catholic. Later he gave his daughter in marriage to one of the better students of the mission, Ato Marsha, who was a police chief in Harar, and actually directed the customs at Jaldessa.\nIt is not surprising that Mersha's children were brought up Catholics. [[:fr:Benito Sylvain|Benito Sylvain]], the Haitian lawyer, author and anti-slavery activist who visited Ethiopia a few times during the late 19th and early 20th century wrote:\n\"En l'absence de Ras Makonnen, retenu par l'Empereur \u00e0 Addis-Abeba, pour la conclusion du trait\u00e9 de paix avec l'Italie, \u00e9tait le Gh\u00e9razmatch Banti qui remplissait les d\u00e9licates fonctions de gouverneur. Il manifest\u00e9 de cordiale fa\u04abon sa joie de me voir et apr\u00e8s avoir vid\u00e9 le tedj ou hydromel de l'amiti\u00e9, il me fit donner l'hospitalit\u00e9 chez Ato Marcha, chef des douanes de Guieldessa, dont tous les enfants sont \u00e9lev\u00e9s \u00e0 la Mission catholique fran\u00e7aise que dirige actuellement le sympathique Mgr Andr\u00e9, r\u00e9cemment promu Ev\u00e8que\".\nEnglish translation: \nIn the absence of Ras Mekonnen, kept by the Emperor in Addis Ababa, for the conclusion of the peace treaty with Italy was the Gerazmatch Banti who filled the delicate functions of governor. He expressed in a cordial way his joy to see me, and after emptying the tedj or mead of friendship, he offered me hospitality at the residence of Ato Marcha, Chief of Customs of Gildessa, with all the children raised in the French Catholic Mission currently headed by the friendly Mgr Andr\u00e9 who was recently promoted Bishop.\nMission schools such as those founded by the French missionary Andre Jarosseau (Abba Endryas) trained a generation of young Ethiopians. Recent biographies (e.g. Ras Emru Haile Selassie) shed light on the importance of these schools. In his autobiography, Captain Alemayehu Abebe, one of the pioneers of Ethiopian aviation and the first black African pilot of a commercial jet airliner, wrote:\n\u12a0\u1276 \u1218\u122d\u123b \u12a8\u1290\u1264\u1270\u1230\u1266\u127b\u1278\u12cd \u1260\u1210\u1228\u122d \u12a8\u1270\u121b \u12e8\u1273\u12c8\u1241\u1293 \u12e8\u1270\u12a8\u1260\u1229 \u12e8\u12ab\u1276\u120a\u12ad \u1203\u12ed\u121b\u1296\u1275 \u1270\u12a8\u1273\u12ed \u1235\u1208\u1290\u1260\u1229 \u121d\u1295\u1234\u1298\u122d \u12a0\u1295\u12f5\u122c \u12e3\u1229\u1236 \u1260\u121a\u12eb\u1235\u1270\u12f3\u12f5\u1229\u1275 \u12e8\u12ab\u1276\u120a\u12ad \u121a\u1232\u12ee\u1295 \u1308\u1265\u127c \u1260\u12a0\u12f3\u122a\u1290\u1275 \u12a5\u1295\u12f5\u121b\u122d \u1270\u12f0\u1228\u1308\nEnglish translation: \nSince Ato Mersha, along with his family, was a well-known and respected follower of the Catholic faith in the city Harar, I was allowed to attend the mission school headed by Mgr Andre Jarousseau.\nAnother important biography by Mickael Bethe-Selassi\u00e9 describes in detail the historic contributions of Catholic Ethiopians during the first half of the 20th century. Many, including Mersha Nahusenay and the author's uncle Berhane-Marqos Welde-Tsadiq, played a role in the modernization efforts of Emperors Menelik and Haile Selassi\u00e9. The biographer argues that these Catholics form a distinct sub-group within the larger community of educated men also known as \"La Jeune Ethiopie\". However, the historic ties between Catholic and Orthodox Christian intellectuals have also been stressed by Mickael as well other scholars. \nThe Ethiopian Roman Catholic community, the first of whose members were converted in the late 19th century by Italian or French missionaries, such as Guglielmo Massaia and Andr\u00e9 Jarosseau, included Z\u00e4wg\u00e4 Haylu, who attended the Paris Exposition Universelle of 1900, and M\u00e4rsha Nahu S\u00e4nay, who represented Menelik at the ceremony marking the completion of the Jibuti railway as far as the Ethiopian frontier in 1902. The community thus came into existence at the very same time as the emergence of the Young Ethiopians as a whole. The Catholic community was moreover influenced by the same factors - missionary education, travel to France or Italy, employment by foreigners, service on the railway, etc. -which gave birth, as we have seen, more generally to Young Ethiopianism.\nDeath and legacy.\nMersha retired in the mid-1920s, but he maintained contact with friends such as the missionary A. Jarousseau, according to historian Bahru Zewde. His retirement comes after a long public service of important contributions in four key areas: border and railway security, public administration, economic development and diplomacy. Mersha soon fell ill and was confined to bed for almost a decade. He died in his mid-eighties, during the Italian occupation, and was laid to rest in the city of Harar.\n[[File:Mersha during retirement.jpg|thumbnail|Mersha Nahusenay during retirement]]\nMersha nurtured a large family. He and his wife Tedeneqyalesh were blessed with eleven children: Beyene, Negest, Zewditu, Alemu, Worqe, Desta, Yosef, Marqos, Negatu, Zegeye, and Medemdemya. He encouraged his children to attend school and appreciate foreign languages. Beyene Mersha, his eldest child, spoke French fluently. Even his daughter (probably Zewditu) knew French. She read a welcome speech to Colonel [[Jean-Baptiste Marchand]] (1863\u20131934), the French officer and explorer who traveled through [[Harar]] in 1899, according to the missionary Martial de Salviac. Mersha loved take his family to important public events. Martial describes how Mersha, a proud father, attended the opening ceremony of the Dawale railway station in 1900 surrounded by \"a beautiful crowd of eight children.\"\nIn the late 1890s, young Beyene, who was fluent in French, traveled to France and Italy with Andre Jarosseau. In 1903, on behalf of his father, he met in Dire Dawa with R.P. Skinner, the American diplomat sent by Theodore Roosevelt to sign a trade treaty with Menelik. Mersha himself was present, however, when the first ever US diplomatic mission completed its visit and was preparing to leave Dire Dawa for Djibouti. In fact he conveyed a farewell message from the Emperor delivered over the phone from Addis. \nBeyene Mersha was later appointed by the emperor as head of the postal and telephone service opened in the frontier town of Dawale. During the period of uncertainty, following the emperor death, he stood on the side of those who campaigned to deny Lej Iyasu the throne, under the leadership of [[Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam|Fitawrari Tekle Hawaryat]]. In 1931, 'balambaras' Beyene was appointed director of the first Ethiopian School for Girls founded in Addis Abeba by Empress Menen. Prior to that, he was a member of the board for construction od the Dessie-Asseb road, a project undertaken by a team of Dutch engineers.\nAto Denqu, husband of Negest Mersha, was appointed in 1907 as the chief of Dire Dawa's Post Office. He too traveled to Europe (e.g. Switzerland and Italy) to attend meetings of the International Postal Union after Ethiopia became a member in 1908. Many grandchildren and great-grandchildren live and work in Ethiopia and around the world. The most notable descendant today, Ato Abinet Gebremeskel, is a successful businessman and philanthropist in Ethiopia. The author of this short biography (click [[:am:\u1218\u122d\u123b \u1293\u1201\u1230\u1293\u12ed|here]] for Amharic version of the Bio), is the grandson of Zegeye Mersha and great-grandson of Mersha.\n[[File:Mersha Nahusenay Street in Dire Dawa.jpg|thumbnail|Mersha Nahusenay Street (Kezira, Dire Dawa)]]\nMersha's legacy includes a street named after him in Kezira (Gezira), a subsection of Dire Dawa during the reign of Emperor [[Haile Selassie]]. He was remembered and honored when the railway city celebrated its 105th anniversary in December 2007.\nHowever, Mersha is still very much a forgotten hero. His biography remains unwritten and his distinguished service is poorly known by many scholars and students of Ethiopian history. In his book titled \"Pioneers of Change in Ethiopia: The reformist Intellectuals of the early twentieth century\", Professor [[:fr:Bahru Zewde|Bahru Zewde]] describes the contributions of many historic personalities of that dynamic era. The book does not mention Mersha as a pioneer. However, some of the reformist intellectuals discussed had either administered the offices he helped establish or occupied the positions he held before. Neggadras [[Gebrehiwot Baykedagn]] (c.1885-1918), arguably the foremost intellectual of the time, for example, was director of the Dire Dawa customs administration.\nFitawrari Tekle Hawariat Tekle-Mariam (1884\u20131977), who later became governor of Jigjiga; credited for founding Asebe Teferi; and is best known for playing a prominent role in the drafting of the 1931 constitution, was chief of the railway station briefly during Lij Iyasu. He was also among the first Ethiopians to travel abroad for education. As a matter of fact, shortly before the young Tekle Hawaryat departed for Russia, in 1896, Mersha gave him his blessings. We find the following interesting account in his autobiography,:\n\u1304\u120d\u12f4\u1233 \u120b\u12ed \u1235\u1295\u12f0\u122d\u1235 \u12a0\u1276 \u1218\u122d\u123b \u1293\u1201 \u1230\u1293\u12ed \u12a8\u1264\u1273\u1278\u12cd \u12c8\u1235\u12f0\u12cd \u130b\u1260\u12d9\u129d \u1362 \u12eb\u1235\u1240\u1229\u129b\u120d \u1265\u12ec \u1348\u122d\u127c \u1260\u1276\u120e \u12c8\u1323\u1201\u1293 \u12c8\u12f0 \u1230\u1348\u122c \u122e\u1325\u12a9 \u1362 \u1340\u1213\u12ed \u12a5\u1295\u12f3\u12ed\u130e\u12f3\u129d \u12a0\u1235\u1260\u12cd \u12a0\u1276 \u1218\u122d\u123b \u1325\u120b \u1308\u12dd\u1270\u12cd \u1230\u1321\u129d \u1362 (\u12a8\u12c8\u1295\u12f5\u121c \u12a8\u121f\u1279 \u1308\u1265\u1228 \u133b\u12f5\u1245 \u130b\u122d \u1260\u1323\u121d \u12ed\u134b\u1240\u1229 \u1290\u1260\u122d) (p.\u00a078)\nEnglish translation: \nWhen we arrived at Jaldessa, Ato Mersha invited me for lunch at his residence. Because I was afraid that he might not let me travel overseas, I ran away as soon as I finished. Ato Mersha, however, bought me an umbrella so I could protect myself from the scorching sun. (He and my deceased brother Gebre Tsadiq were dear friends).\nThe last few decades of the 19th century marked the beginning of a long period of modernization in Ethiopian history in the sense that they opened the door to new ways and better conditions of life and work. Significant achievements were recorded during the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie in areas such as manufacturing, transportation (e.g. aviation) and education. Trade and foreign direct investment continued to play a key role in the young economy. Despite some serious setbacks in the two decades after the 1974 popular revolution, primarily due to severe droughts and civil war but also bad policies, the country underwent a radical transformation. The revolution has ended the feudal (\u1263\u120b\u1263\u1275) system paving the way for greater participation of people in political and economic activities. During the past several decades, Ethiopia has witnessed unprecedented economic development characterized by a strong government sector, expanding private sector and major development of critical infrastructure (e.g. roads, new Djibouti-Addis railway, etc.). Whether or this momentum will be maintained, time will tell. When all is said and done, however, there is general consensus that much of the progress made over the last century is deeply rooted in the historic events and reforms of the late 19th - early 20th century.\nReferences.\n[[Category:History of Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:19th-century Ethiopian people]]\n[[Category:19th century in Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:20th century in Ethiopia]]\n[[Category:1850s births]]\n[[Category:1930 deaths]]"}
{"title": "Robert_Bloch", "label": "Writer", "text": "Robert Albert Bloch (; April 5, 1917September 23, 1994) was an American fiction writer, primarily of crime, psychological horror, fantasy, much of which has been dramatised for radio, cinema and television. He also wrote a relatively small amount of science fiction. Best known as the writer of \"Psycho\" (1959), the basis for the film of the same name by Alfred Hitchcock, Bloch wrote hundreds of short stories and over 30 novels. He was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of H. P. Lovecraft, who was the first to seriously encourage his talent, and began his professional writing career immediately after graduation, aged 17. However, while Bloch started his career by emulating Lovecraft and his brand of \"cosmic horror\", he later specialized in crime and horror stories dealing with a more psychological approach.\nBloch was a contributor to pulp magazines such as \"Weird Tales\" in his early career, and was also a prolific screenwriter and a major contributor to science fiction fanzines and fandom in general.\nHe won the Hugo Award (for his story \"That Hell-Bound Train\"), the Bram Stoker Award, and the World Fantasy Award. He served a term as president of the Mystery Writers of America (1970) and was a member of that organization and of Science Fiction Writers of America, the Writers Guild of America, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and the Count Dracula Society. In 2008, The Library of America selected Bloch's essay \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\" (1962) for inclusion in its two-century retrospective of American true crime.\nHis favorites among his own novels were \"The Kidnapper\", \"The Star Stalker\", \"Psycho\", \"Night-World,\" and \"Strange Eons\". His work has been extensively adapted into films, television productions, comics, and audiobooks.\nEarly life and education.\nBloch was born in Chicago, the son of Raphael \"Ray\" Bloch (1884\u20131952), a bank cashier, and his wife Stella Loeb (1880\u20131944), a social worker, both of German Jewish descent. Bloch's family moved to Maywood, a Chicago suburb, when he was five; he lived there until he was ten. He attended the Methodist Church there, despite his parents' Jewish heritage, and studied at Emerson Grammar School. In 1925, at eight years of age, living in Maywood, he attended (alone at night) a screening of Lon Chaney, Sr.'s film \"The Phantom of the Opera\" (1925). The scene of Chaney removing his mask terrified the young Bloch (\"it scared the living hell out of me and I ran all the way home to enjoy the first of about two years of recurrent nightmares\"). It also sparked his interest in horror. Bloch was a precocious child and found himself in fourth grade when he was eight. He also obtained a pass into the adult section of the public library, where he read omnivorously. Bloch considered himself a budding artist and worked in pencil sketching and watercolours, but myopia in adolescence seemed to effectively bar art as a career. He had passions for German-made lead toy soldiers and for silent cinema.\nIn 1929, Bloch's father Ray Bloch lost his bank job, and the family moved to Milwaukee, where Stella worked at the Milwaukee Jewish Settlement settlement house. Robert attended Washington, then Lincoln High School, where he met lifelong friend Harold Gauer. Gauer was editor of \"The Quill\", Lincoln's literary magazine, and accepted Bloch's first published short story, a horror story titled \"The Thing\" (the \"thing\" of the title was Death). Both Bloch and Gauer graduated from Lincoln in 1934 during the height of the Great Depression. Bloch was involved in the drama department at Lincoln and wrote and performed in school vaudeville skits.\nCareer.\n\"Weird Tales\" magazine and the influence of H. P. Lovecraft.\nDuring the 1930s, Bloch was an avid reader of the pulp magazine \"Weird Tales\", which he had discovered at the age of ten in 1927. In the Chicago Northwestern Railroad depot with his parents and aunt Lil, his aunt offered to buy him any magazine he wanted and he picked \"Weird Tales\" (Aug 1927 issue) off the newsstand over her shocked protest. He began his readings of the magazine with the first instalment of Otis Adelbert Kline's \"The Bride of Osiris\" which dealt with a secret Egyptian city called Karneter located beneath Bloch's birth city of Chicago. The Depression came in the early 1930s. He later recalled, in accepting the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention (1975), how \"times were very hard. \"Weird Tales\" cost twenty-five cents in a day when most pulp magazines cost a dime. I remember that meant a lot to me.\" He went on to relate how he would get up very early on the last day of the month, with twenty-five cents saved from his monthly allowance of one dollar, and would run all the way to a combination tobacco/magazine store and buy the new \"Weird Tales\" issue, sometimes smuggling it home under his coat if the cover was particularly risqu\u00e9. His parents were not impressed with Hugh Doak Rankin's sexy covers for the magazine, and when the Bloch family moved to Milwaukee in 1928 young Bloch gradually abandoned his interest. But by the time he had entered high school, he returned to reading \"Weird Tales\" during convalescence from flu.\nH. P. Lovecraft, a frequent contributor to \"Weird Tales\", became one of his favorite writers. The first of Lovecraft's stories he had read was \"Pickman's Model,\" in \"Weird Tales\" for October 1927. Bloch wrote: \"In school I was forced to squirm my way through the works of Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Lowell and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. In 'Pickman's Model', the ghouls ate all three. Now that, I decided, was poetic justice.\" As a teenager, Bloch wrote a fan letter to Lovecraft (1933), asking where he could find copies of earlier stories of Lovecraft's that Bloch had missed. Lovecraft lent them to him. Lovecraft also gave Bloch advice on his early fiction-writing efforts. asking whether Bloch had written any weird work and, if so, whether he might see samples of it. Bloch took up Lovecraft's offer in late April 1933, sending him two short items, \"The Gallows\" and another work whose title is unknown.\nLovecraft also suggested Bloch write to other members of the Lovecraft Circle, including August Derleth, R. H. Barlow, Clark Ashton Smith, Donald Wandrei, Frank Belknap Long, Henry S. Whitehead, E. Hoffmann Price, Bernard Austin Dwyer and J. Vernon Shea. Bloch's first completed tales were \"Lilies,\" \"The Laughter of a Young Ghoul\" and \"The Black Lotus\". Bloch submitted these to \"Weird Tales\"; editor Farnsworth Wright summarily rejected them all. However Bloch successfully placed \"Lilies\" in the semi-professional magazine \"Marvel Tales\" (Winter 1934) and \"Black Lotus\" in \"Unusual Stories\" (1935). Bloch later commented, \"I figured I'd better do something different or I'd end up as a florist.\"\nBloch graduated from high school in June 1934. He then wrote a story which promptly (six weeks later) sold to \"Weird Tales.\" Bloch's first publication in \"Weird Tales\" was a letter criticising the Conan stories of Robert E. Howard. His first professional sales, at the age of 17 (July 1934), to \"Weird Tales,\" were the short stories \"The Feast in the Abbey\" and \"The Secret in the Tomb\". \"Feast ...\" appeared first, in the January 1935 issue, which actually went on sale November 1, 1934; \"The Secret in the Tomb\" appeared in the May 1935 \"Weird Tales\".\nBloch's correspondence with Derleth led to a visit to Derleth's home in Sauk City, Wisconsin (the headquarters of Arkham House). Bloch was impressed by Derleth who \"fulfilled my expectations as a writer by wearing this purple velvet smoking jacket. That impressed me even more because Derleth didn't even smoke.\" Following this, and continued correspondence with Lovecraft, Bloch went to Chicago and met Farnsworth Wright, the then editor of \"Weird Tales\". He also met the first \"Weird Tales\" writer outside of Derleth he had encountered - Otto Binder.\nBloch's early stories were strongly influenced by Lovecraft. Indeed, a number of his stories were set in, and extended, the world of Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. These include \"The Dark Demon\", in which the character Gordon is a figuration of Lovecraft, and which features Nyarlathotep; \"The Faceless God\" (features Nyarlathotep); \"The Grinning Ghoul\" (written after the manner of Lovecraft) and \"The Unspeakable Betrothal\" (vaguely attached to the Cthulhu Mythos). It was Bloch who invented, for example, the oft-cited Mythos texts \"De Vermis Mysteriis\" and \"Cultes des Goules\". Many other stories influenced by Lovecraft were later collected in Bloch's volume \"Mysteries of the Worm\" (now in its third, expanded edition). In 1935, Bloch wrote the tale \"Satan's Servants\", on which Lovecraft lent much advice, but none of the prose was by Lovecraft; this tale did not appear in print until 1949, in \"Something About Cats and Other Pieces\".\nThe young Bloch appears, thinly disguised, as the character Robert Blake in Lovecraft's story \"The Haunter of the Dark\" (1936), which is dedicated to Bloch. Bloch was the only individual to whom Lovecraft ever dedicated a story. In this story, Lovecraft kills off Robert Blake, the Bloch-based character, repaying a \"courtesy\" Bloch earlier paid Lovecraft with his 1935 tale \"The Shambler from the Stars\", in which the Lovecraft-inspired figure dies; the story goes so far as to use Bloch's then-current address (620 East Knapp Street) in Milwaukee. (Bloch even had a signed certificate from Lovecraft [and some of his creations] giving Bloch permission to kill Lovecraft off in a story.) Bloch later recalled \"believe me, beyond all doubt, I don't know anyone else I'd rather be killed by.\" Bloch later wrote a third tale, \"The Shadow From the Steeple\", picking up where \"The Haunter of the Dark\" finished (\"Weird Tales\" Sept 1950).\nLovecraft's death in 1937 deeply affected Bloch, who was then aged only 20. He recalled \"Part of me died with him, I guess, not only because he was not a god, he was mortal, that is true, but because he had so little recognition in his own lifetime. There were no novels or collections published, no great realization, even here in Providence, of what was lost.\" Elsewhere he wrote, \"the news of his fate came to me as a shattering blow; all the more so because the world at large ignored his passing. Only my parents and a few correspondents seemed to sense my shock, and my feeling that a part of me had died with him.\"\nAfter Lovecraft's death in 1937, Bloch continued writing for \"Weird Tales\", where he became one of its most popular authors. He also began contributing to other pulps, such as the science fiction magazine \"Amazing Stories\". Bloch broadened the scope of his fiction. His horror themes included voodoo (\"Mother of Serpents\"), the conte cruel (\"The Mandarin's Canaries\"), demonic possession (\"Fiddler's Fee\"), and black magic (\"Return to the Sabbat\"). Bloch visited Henry Kuttner in California in 1937. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\", was published in \"Amazing Stories\" (August 1938).\nMilwaukee Fictioneers and the Depression.\nIn 1935 Bloch joined a writers' group, The Milwaukee Fictioneers, members of which included Stanley Weinbaum, Ralph Milne Farley and Raymond A. Palmer. Another member of the group was Gustav Marx, who offered Bloch a job writing copy in his advertising firm, also allowing Bloch to write stories in his spare time in the office. Bloch was close friends with C.L. Moore and her husband Henry Kuttner, who visited him in Milwaukee.\nDuring the years of the Depression, Bloch appeared regularly in dramatic productions, writing and performing in his own sketches. Around 1936 he sold some gags to radio comedians Stoopnagle and Budd, and to Roy Atwell. Also in 1936, his tale \"The Grinning Ghoul\" was published in \"Weird Tales\" (June); \"The Opener of the Way\" appeared in \"Weird Tales\" (Oct); \"Mother of Serpents\" appeared in the December issue. The December issue also contained Lovecraft's tale \"The Haunter of the Dark\" in which he killed off young author \"Robert Blake\".\nIn 1937, following Lovecraft's death, \"The Mannikin\" appeared in \"Weird Tales\" for April. \"Weird Tales\" published \"Return to the Sabbath\" in July 1938. Bloch's first science fiction story, \"The Secret of the Observatory\" appeared in \"Amazing Stories\" (Aug 1938). In a profile accompanying this tale, Bloch described himself as \"tall, dark, unhandsome\" with \"all the charm and personality of a swamp adder\". He noted that \"I hate everything\", but reserved particular dislike for \"bean soup, red nail polish, house-cleaning, and optimists\".\nCampaign manager for Carl Zeidler.\nIn 1939, Bloch was contacted by James Doolittle, who was managing the campaign for Mayor of Milwaukee of a little-known assistant city attorney named Carl Zeidler. He was asked to work on Zeidler's speechwriting, advertising, and photo ops, in collaboration with his long-time friend Harold Gauer. They created elaborate campaign shows; in Bloch's 1993 autobiography, \"Once Around the Bloch\", he gives an inside account of the campaign, and the innovations he and Gauer came up with \u2013 for instance, the original releasing-balloons-from-the-ceiling schtick. He comments bitterly on how, after Zeidler's victory, they were ignored and not even paid their promised salaries. He ends the story with a wryly philosophical point:\nAlso in 1939, two of Bloch's tales were published: \"The Strange Flight of Richard Clayton\" (\"Amazing Stories,\" August) and \"The Cloak\" (\"Unknown,\" March). Many of the stories Bloch published in \"Strange Stories\" in 1939 as by 'Tarleton Fiske' fantasy/horror hybrids of the contes cruels type.\n1940s and 1950s.\nIn October 1941, the tale \"A Good Knight's Work\" in \"Unknown Worlds\" first appeared. Shortly thereafter, Bloch created the Damon Runyon-esque humorous series character Lefty Feep in the story \"Time Wounds All Heels\" \"Fantastic Adventures\" (April 1942). This magazine, along with \"Weird Tales,\" published most of the over 100 stories Bloch wrote in the first decade of his career. Around the same time, he began work as an advertising copywriter at the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency, a position he held until 1953. Marx allowed Bloch to write stories in the office in quiet times. Bloch published a total of 23 Lefty Feep stories in \"Fantastic Adventures\", the last one published in 1950, but the bulk appeared during World War II. Feep's character name had actually been coined by Bloch's friend/collaborator Harold Gauer for their unpublished novel \"In the Land of Sky-Blue Ointments\", Bloch also worked for a time in local vaudeville and tried to break into writing for nationally-known performers.\nBloch gradually evolved away from Lovecraftian imitations towards a unique style of his own. One of the first distinctly \"Blochian\" stories was \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" (\"Weird Tales\", July 1943). The story was Bloch's take on the Jack the Ripper legend, and was filled out with more genuine factual details of the case than many other fictional treatments. It cast the Ripper as an eternal being who must make human sacrifices to extend his immortality. It was adapted for both radio (in \"Stay Tuned for Terror\") and television (as an episode of \"Thriller\" in 1961 adapted by Barr\u00e9 Lyndon). Bloch followed up this story with a number of others in a similar vein dealing with half-historic, half-legendary figures such as the Man in the Iron Mask (\"Iron Mask\", 1944), the Marquis de Sade (\"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\", 1945) and Lizzie Borden (\"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe ...\", 1946).\nIn 1944, Laird Cregar performed Bloch's tale \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" over a coast-to-coast radio network.\nTowards the end of World War Two, in 1945, Bloch was asked to write 39 15-minute episodes of his own radio horror show called \"Stay Tuned for Terror\". Many of the programs were adaptations of his own pulp stories. (All episodes were broadcast, but recordings were thought to be lost. However, in 2020, two episodes, \"The Bogeyman Will Get You\" and \"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe\" were re-discovered amongst the archives of an old-time radio enthusiast. These episodes have now been posted on YouTube and Internet Archive).. The same year he published \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\" (\"Weird Tales,\" Sept). August Derleth's Arkham House, Lovecraft's publisher, published Bloch's first collection of short stories, \"The Opener of the Way\", in an edition of 2,000 copies, with jacket art by Ronald Clyne. At the same time, his best-known early tale, \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\", received considerable attention through dramatization on radio and reprinting in anthologies. This story, as noted below, involving a Ripper who has found literal immortality through his crimes, has been widely imitated (or plagiarized); Bloch himself would return to the theme (see below). Stories published in 1946 include \"Enoch\" (\"Weird Tales\", Sept) and \"Lizzie Borden Took an Axe\" (\"Weird Tales\", Nov).\nBloch's first novel was published in hardcover \u2013 the thriller \"The Scarf\" (The Dial Press 1947; the Fawcett Gold medal paperback of 1966 features a revised text). It tells the story of a writer, Daniel Morley, who uses real women as models for his characters. But as soon as he is done writing the story, he is compelled to murder them, and always the same way: with the maroon scarf he has had since childhood. The story begins in Minneapolis and follows him and his trail of dead bodies to Chicago, New York City, and finally Hollywood, where his hit novel is going to be turned into a movie, and where his self-control may have reached its limit.\nIn 1948, Bloch was the Guest of Honor at Torcon I, World Science Fiction Convention, Toronto, Canada. In 1952 he published \"Lucy Comes to Stay\" (\"Weird Tales\", Jan). Bloch popularised the \"Auction Bloch\" at science fiction conventions during the 1950s, a practice in which fans bid on professionals, buying an hour of their time. Bloch would auction off an hour of some well-known writer's time at a convention to raise money for a worthy cause. (The time gave the winner an hour of personal interaction with the writer at the convention.) \nBloch published three novels in 1954 \u2013 \"Spiderweb\", \"The Kidnapper\" and \"The Will to Kill\" as he endeavored to support his family. That same year he was a weekly guest panelist on the TV quiz show \"It's a Draw\". \"Shooting Star\" (1958), a mainstream novel, was published in a double volume with a collection of Bloch's stories titled \"Terror in the Night\". \"This Crowded Earth\" (1958) was science fiction.\nWith the demise of \"Weird Tales\", Bloch continued to have his fiction published in \"Amazing\", \"Fantastic\", \"The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction\", and \"Fantastic Universe\"; he was a particularly frequent contributor to \"Imagination\" and \"Imaginative Tales\". His output of thrillers increased and he began to appear regularly in \"The Saint\", \"Ellery Queen\" and similar mystery magazines, and to such suspense and horror-fiction magazine projects as \"Shock\".\nJack the Ripper.\nBloch continued to revisit the Jack the Ripper theme. His contribution to Harlan Ellison's 1967 science fiction anthology \"Dangerous Visions\" was a story, \"A Toy for Juliette\", which evoked both Jack the Ripper and the Marquis de Sade in a time-travel story. The same anthology had Ellison's sequel to it titled \"The Prowler in the City at the Edge of the World\". His earlier idea of the Ripper as an immortal being resurfaced in Bloch's contribution to the original \"Star Trek\" series episode \"Wolf in the Fold\". His 1984 novel \"Night of the Ripper\" is set during the reign of Queen Victoria and follows the investigation of Inspector Frederick Abberline in attempting to apprehend the Ripper, and includes some famous Victorians such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle within the storyline.\n\"Psycho\".\nBloch won the Hugo Award for Best Short Story for \"That Hellbound Train\" in 1959, the same year that his sixth novel, \"Psycho,\" was published. Bloch had written an earlier short story involving dissociative identity disorder, \"The Real Bad Friend\", which appeared in the February 1957 \"Mike Shayne Mystery Magazine\", that foreshadowed the 1959 novel \"Psycho\". However, \"Psycho\" also has thematic links to the story \"Lucy Comes to Stay.\" Also in 1959, Bloch delivered a lecture titled \"Imagination and Modern Social Criticism\" at the University of Chicago; this was reprinted in the critical volume \"The Science Fiction Novel\" (Advent Publishers). His story \"The Hungry Eye\" appeared in \"Fantastic\" (May). This was also the year in which, despite having graduated from painting watercolours to oils, he gave up painting completely.\nNorman Bates, the main character in \"Psycho\", was very loosely based on two people. First was the real-life serial killer Ed Gein, about whom Bloch later wrote a fictionalized account, \"The Shambles of Ed Gein\". (The story can be found in \"Crimes and Punishments: The Lost Bloch, Volume 3\"). Second, it has been indicated by several people, including Noel Carter (wife of Lin Carter) and Chris Steinbrunner, as well as allegedly by Bloch himself, that Norman Bates was partly based on Calvin Beck, publisher of \"Castle of Frankenstein\". Bloch's basing of the character of Norman Bates on Ed Gein is discussed in the documentary \"Ed Gein: The Ghoul of Plainfield\", which can be found on Disc 2 of the DVD release of the remake of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" (2003). However, Bloch also commented that it was the situation itself \u2013 a mass murderer living undetected and unsuspected in a typical small town in middle America \u2013 rather than Gein himself who sparked Bloch's storyline. He writes: \"Thus the real-life murderer was not the role model for my character Norman Bates. Ed Gein didn't own or operate a motel. Ed Gein didn't kill anyone in the shower. Ed Gein wasn't into taxidermy. Ed Gein didn't stuff his mother, keep her body in the house, dress in a drag outfit, or adopt an alternative personality. These were the functions and characteristics of Norman Bates, and Norman Bates didn't exist until I made him up. Out of my own imagination, I add, which is probably the reason so few offer to take showers with me.\"\nThough Bloch had little involvement with the film version of his novel, which was directed by Alfred Hitchcock from an adapted screenplay by Joseph Stefano, he was to become most famous as its author. Bloch was awarded a special Mystery Writers of America scroll for the novel in 1961.\nThe novel is one of the first examples at full length of Bloch's use of modern urban horror relying on the horrors of interior psychology rather than the supernatural. \"By the mid-1940s, I had pretty well mined the vein of ordinary supernatural themes until it had become varicose,\" Bloch explained to Douglas E. Winter in an interview. \"I realized, as a result of what went on during World War II and of reading the more widely disseminated work in psychology, that the real horror is not in the shadows, but in that twisted little world inside our own skulls.\" While Bloch was not the first horror writer to utilise a psychological approach (it originates in the work of Edgar Allan Poe), Bloch's psychological approach in modern times was comparatively unique.\nBloch's agent, Harry Altshuler, received a \"blind bid\" for the novel \u2013 the buyer's name was not mentioned \u2013 of $7,500 for screen rights to the book. The bid eventually went to $9,500, which Bloch accepted. Bloch had never sold a book to Hollywood before. His contract with Simon &amp; Schuster included no bonus for a film sale. The publisher took 15 percent according to contract, while the agent took his 10%; Bloch wound up with about $6,750 before taxes. Despite the enormous profits generated by Hitchcock's film, Bloch received no further direct compensation.\nOnly Hitchcock's film was based on Bloch's novel. The later films in the \"Psycho\" series bear no relation to either of Bloch's sequel novels. Indeed, Bloch's proposed script for the film \"Psycho II\" was rejected by the studio (as were many other submissions), and it was this that he subsequently adapted for his own sequel novel.\nThe film \"Hitchcock\" (2012) tells the story of Alfred Hitchcock's making of the film version of \"Psycho\". Although it mentions Bloch and his novel, Bloch himself is not a character in the movie.\nThe early 1960s: Screenwriting and fiction.\nFollowing his move to Hollywood, around 1960, Bloch had multiple assignments from various television companies. However, he was not allowed to write for five months when the Writers Guild had a strike. After the strike was over, he became a frequent scriptwriter for television and film projects in the mystery, suspense, and horror genre. His first assignments were for the Macdonald Carey vehicle, \"Lock-Up\", (penning five episodes) as well as one for \"Whispering Smith\". Further TV work included an episode of \"Bus Stop\" (\"I Kiss Your Shadow\"), 10 episodes of \"Thriller\" (1960\u201362, several based on his own stories), and 10 episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" (1960\u201362). His short story collection \"Pleasant Dreams - Nightmares\" was published by Arkham House in 1960.\nBloch wrote the screenplay for \"The Cabinet of Caligari\" (1962), which is only very loosely related to the 1920 German silent film, and proved to be an unhappy experience. The same year, Bloch penned the story and teleplay \"The Sorcerer's Apprentice\" for \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\". The episode was shelved when the NBC Television Network and sponsor Revlon called its ending \"too gruesome\" (by 1960s standards) for airing. Bloch was pleased later when the episode was included in the program's syndication package to affiliate stations, where not one complaint was registered. Today, due to public domain status, the episode is readily available in home media formats from numerous distributors and is even available on free video on demand.\nHis TV work did not slow Bloch's fictional output. In the early 1960s he published several novels, including \"The Dead Beat\" (1960), and \"Firebug\" (1961), for which Harlan Ellison, then an editor at Regency Books, contributed the first 1,200 words. In 1962 numerous works appeared in book form. Bloch's novel \"The Couch\" (1962) (the basis for the screenplay of his first movie, filmed the same year) was published. That year several Bloch short story collections \u2013 \"Atoms and Evil\", \"More Nightmares\" and \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" \u2013 were published, as well as another novel, \"Terror\" (whose working titles included \"Amok\" and \"Kill for Kali\"). Editor Earl Kemp assembled a selection of Bloch's prolific output for fan magazines as \"The Eight Stage of Fandom: Selections from 25 years of Fan Writing\" (Advent Publishers). In this era, Stephen King later wrote, \"What Bloch did with such novels as \"The Deadbeat\", \"The Scarf\", \"Firebug\", \"Psycho\", and \"The Couch\" was to re-discover the suspense novel and reinvent the antihero as first discovered by James Cain.\"\nDuring 1963, Bloch saw into print two further collections of short stories, \"Bogey men\" and \"Horror-7\". In 1964 Bloch married Eleanor Alexander and wrote original screenplays for two films produced and directed by William Castle, \"Strait-Jacket\" (1964) and \"The Night Walker\" (also 1964), along with \"The Skull\" (1965). The latter film was based on his short story \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\".\nThe 1960s and 1970s: Film &amp; TV writing.\nBloch's further TV writing in this period included \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\" (7 episodes, 1962\u20131965), \"I Spy\" (1 episode, 1966), \"Run for Your Life\" (1 episode, 1966), and \"The Girl from U.N.C.L.E.\" (1 episode, 1967). He penned three scripts for the original \"\" series which were screened in 1966 and 1967: \"What Are Little Girls Made Of?\", \"Wolf in the Fold\" (another Jack the Ripper variant), and \"\".\nIn 1968, Bloch returned to London to do two episodes for the English Hammer Films series \"Journey to the Unknown\" for Twentieth Century Fox. One of the episodes, \"The Indian Spirit Guide\", was included in the American TV movie \"Journey to Midnight\" (1968). The other episode was \"Girl of My Dreams,\" co-scripted with Michael J. Bird and based on the eponymous story by Richard Matheson.\nFollowing the movie \"The Skull\" (1965), which was based on a Bloch story but scripted by Milton Subotsky, he wrote the screenplays for five feature films produced by Amicus Productions \u2013 \"The Psychopath\" (1966), \"The Deadly Bees\" (co-written with Anthony Marriott, 1967), \"Torture Garden\" (also 1967), \"The House That Dripped Blood\" (1971) and \"Asylum\" (1972). The last two films featured stories written by Bloch that were printed first in anthologies he wrote in the 1940s and early 1950s.\nDuring the 1970s, Bloch wrote two TV movies for director Curtis Harrington \u2013 \"The Cat Creature\" (1973) (an \"ABC Movie of the Week\") and \"The Dead Don't Die\". \"The Cat Creature\" was an unhappy production experience for Bloch. Producer Doug Cramer wanted to do an update of \"Cat People\" (1942), the Val Lewton-produced film. Bloch commented: \"Instead, I suggested a blending of the elements of several well-remembered films, and came up with a story line which dealt with the Egyptian cat-goddess (Bast), reincarnation and the first bypass operation ever performed on an artichoke heart.\" A detailed account of the troubled production of the film is described in Bloch's autobiography.\nBloch meanwhile (interspersed between his screenplays for Amicus Productions and other projects), penned single episodes for \"Night Gallery\" (1971), \"Ghost Story\" (1972), \"The Manhunter\" (1974), and \"Gemini Man\" (1976).\nThe later 1960s and 1970s: Fiction.\nIn 1965, two further collections of short stories appeared - \"The Skull of the Marquis de Sade\" and \"Tales in a Jugular Vein\". 1966 saw Bloch win the Ann Radcliffe Award for Television and publisher yet another collection of shorts - \"Chamber of Horrors\". Bloch returned to the site of his childhood home at 620 East Knapp St, Milwaukee (the address used by Lovecraft for the character Robert Blake in \"The Haunter of the Dark\") only to find the neighborhood razed and the entire neighborhood leveled and replaced by expressway approaches.\nIn 1967, another Bloch collection, \"The Living Demons\" was issued. He also published another classic story of Jack the Ripper, \"A Toy for Juliette\" in Harlan Ellison's \"Dangerous Visions\" anthology. In 1968 he published a duo of long sf novellas as \"Ladies' Day\" and \"This Crowded Earth\". His novel \"The Star Stalker\" was published, and \"Dragons and Nightmares\" (the first collection of Lefty Feep stories) appeared in hardcover (Mirage Press).\nThe collection \"Bloch and Bradbury\" (a collaboration with Ray Bradbury) and the hardcover novel \"The Todd Dossier\", originally as by Collier Young, were published in 1969.\nBloch won a second Ann Radcliffe Award, this time for Literature, in 1969. That same year, Bloch was invited to the Second International Film Festival in Rio de Janeiro, March 23\u201331, along with other science fiction writers from the United States, Britain and Europe.\nIn 1971, Bloch served as president of the Mystery Writers of America, meanwhile publishing the novel \"Sneak Preview\", the collection \"Fear Today, Gone Tomorrow,\" and the short novel \"It's All in Your Mind\". In 1972 he published another novel, \"Night-World\". In 1973 Bloch was the Guest of Honor at Torcon II, World Science Fiction Convention, Toronto. 1974 saw the publication of his novel \"American Gothic\", inspired by the true life story of serial killer H.H. Holmes.\nIn 1975, Bloch won the Lifetime Achievement Award at the First World Fantasy Convention held in Providence, Rhode Island. The award was a bust of H. P. Lovecraft. The occasion of this convention was the first time Bloch actually visited the city of Providence. An audio recording was made of Robert Bloch during that 1975 convention, accessible online.\nIn 1976, two records of Bloch recordings of his stories were released by Alternate World recordings \u2013 \"\"\"Gravely, Robert Bloch!\" and \"Blood! The Life and Times of Jack the Ripper! (with Harlan Ellison). In 1977, Lester del Rey edited \"The Best of Robert Bloch\" for Del Rey books. Two further short story collections appeared \u2013 \"Cold Chills\" and \"The King of Terrors.\"\nBloch continued to published short story collections throughout this period. His \"Selected Stories\" (reprinted in paperback with the incorrect title \"The Complete Stories\") appeared in three volumes just prior to his death, although many previously uncollected tales have appeared in volumes published since 1997 (see below). Bloch also contributed the story \"Heir Apparent,\" set in Andre Norton's Witch World, to \"Tales of the Witch World\" (Vol. 1), NY: Tor, 1987.\n1979 saw the publication of Bloch's novel \"There is a Serpent in Eden\" (also reissued as \"The Cunning\"), and two more short story collections, \"Out of the Mouths of graves\" and \"Such Stuff as Screams Are Made Of.\"\nHis numerous novels of the 1970s demonstrate Bloch's thematic range, from science fiction \u2013 \"Sneak Preview\" (1971) \u2013 through horror novels such as the loving Lovecraftian tribute \"Strange Eons\" (Whispers Press, 1978) and the non-supernatural mystery \"There is a Serpent in Eden\" (1979).\nThe 1980s.\nBloch's screenplay-writing career continued active through the 1980s, with teleplays for \"Tales of the Unexpected\" (one episode, 1980), \"Darkroom\" (two episodes,1981), \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" (1 episode, 1986), \"Tales from the Darkside\" (three episodes, 1984\u201387: \"Beetles\", \"A Case of the Stubborns\" and \"Everybody Needs a Little Love\") and \"Monsters\" (three episodes, 1988\u20131989: \"The Legacy\", \"Mannikins of Horror\", and \"Reaper\"). No further screen work appeared in the last five years before his death, although an adaptation of his \"collaboration\" with Edgar Allan Poe, \"The Lighthouse\", was filmed as an episode of \"The Hunger\" in 1998.\n\"The First World Fantasy Convention: Three Authors Remember\" (Necronomicon Press, 1980) features reminiscences of that important event by Bloch, T.E.D. Klein and Fritz Leiber. In 1981, Zebra Books issued the first edition of the Cthulhu Mythos-themed collection \"Mysteries of the Worm\". This item was reprinted some years later in an expanded edition by Chaosium.\nBloch's sequel to the original \"Psycho\", \"Psycho II\", was published in 1982 and in 1983 he novelized \"\". His novel \"Night of the Ripper\" (1984), was another return to one of Bloch's favourite themes, the Jack the Ripper murders of 1888.\nIn 1986, Scream Press published the hardcover omnibus \"Unholy Trinity\", collecting three by now scarce Bloch novels, \"The Scarf\", \"The Dead Beat\", and \"The Couch.\" A second retrospective selection of Bloch's nonfiction was published by NESFA Press as \"Out of My Head.\"\nIn 1987, Bloch celebrated his 70th birthday. Underwood-Miller issued the three-volume hardcover set \"The Selected Stories of Robert Bloch\" (individual volumes titled \"Final Reckonings\", \"Bitter Ends\" and \"Last Rites\"). When Citadel Press reissued this in paperback they incorrectly named it \"The Collected Stories of Robert Bloch.\" The same year a collection, \"Midnight Pleasures\" appeared from Doubleday, and \"Lost in Time and Space with Lefty Feep\" (Creatures at Large Press) collected a number of the stories on the Lefty Feep series. The latter was the first of a projected series of three volumes, but the further volumes were never published. In 1988, Tor Books reissued Bloch's scarce second novel, \"The Kidnapper.\"\nIn 1989, several works were published: the collection \"Fear and Trembling\", the thriller novel \"Lori\" (later adapted as a standalone graphic novel) and another omnibus of long out-of-print early novels, \"Screams\" (containing \"The Will to Kill\", \"Firebug\", and \"The Star Stalker\"). Randall D. Larson issued \"The Robert Bloch Companion: Collected Interviews 1969-1986\" (Starmont House), together with \"Robert Bloch\" (Starmont Reader's Guide No 37), an exhaustive study of Bloch's work, and \"The Complete Robert Bloch: An Illustrated, Comprehensive Bibliography\" (Fandom Unlimited Enterprises). Larson's three books were bound in hardcover and distributed by Borgo Press.\nThe 1990s: Last works.\nBloch's novel, \"The Jekyll Legacy\" (1990), was a collaboration with Andre Norton and a sequel to Robert Louis Stevenson's \"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde\". The same year he returned to the Norman Bates \"mythos\" with \"Psycho House\" (Tor), the third Psycho novel. As with the second novel in the sequence, it bears no relation to the film titled \"Psycho III\". It would prove to be his last published novel.\nIn February 1991, he was given the Honor of Master of Ceremonies at the first World Horror Convention held in Nashville, Tennessee. Weird Tales issued a special Robert Bloch issue in Spring, including his screenplay for the televised version of his tale \"Beetles\"\". A standalone chapbook of the story \"Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper\" was issued in both hardcover and paperback by Pulphouse, and Bloch co-edited with Martin H. Greenberg the original anthology \"Psycho-Paths\" (Tor). In 1991 Bloch contributed an Introduction to \"In Search of Lovecraft\" by J. Vernon Shea.\nIn 1992, Bloch celebrated his 75th birthday with a bash at a Los Angeles mystery/horror bookstore which was attended by many sf/horror notables. In 1993, he published his \"unauthorized autobiography\", \"Once Around the Bloch\" (Tor) and edited the original anthology \"Monsters in Our Midst\".\nIn early 1994, Fedogan and Bremer published a collection of 39 of his stories, \"The Early Fears\". Bloch began editing a new original anthology, \"Robert Bloch's Psychos\" but was unable to complete work on it prior to his death; Martin H. Greenberg finished the work posthumously and the book appeared several years later (1997).\nPersonal life.\nOn October 2, 1940, Bloch married Marion Ruth Holcombe; it was reportedly a marriage of convenience designed to keep Bloch out of the army. During their marriage, she suffered (initially undiagnosed) tuberculosis of the bone, which affected her ability to walk.\nAfter working for 11 years for the Gustav Marx Advertising Agency in Milwaukee, Bloch left in 1953 and moved to Weyauwega, Marion's home town, so she could be close to friends and family. Although she was eventually cured of tuberculosis, she and Bloch divorced in 1963. Bloch's daughter Sally (born 1943) elected to stay with him.\nOn January 18, 1964, Bloch met recently widowed Eleanor (\"Elly\") Alexander (n\u00e9e Zalisko), who had lost her first husband, writer/producer John Alexander, to a heart attack three months earlier, and married her in a civil ceremony on the following October 16. Elly was a fashion model and cosmetician. They honeymooned in Tahiti, and in 1965 visited London, then British Columbia. They remained happily married until Bloch's death. Elly remained in the Los Angeles area for several years after selling their Laurel Canyon Home to fans of Bloch, eventually choosing to go home to Canada to be closer to her own family. She died March 7, 2007, at the Betel Home in Selkirk, Manitoba, Canada. Her ashes have been placed next to Bloch's in a similar book-shaped urn at Pierce Brothers in Westwood, California.\nBloch died on September 23, 1994, after a long battle with cancer, at the age of 77. in Los Angeles after a writing career lasting 60 years, including more than 30 years in television and film. Bloch survived by seven months the death of another member of the original \"Lovecraft Circle\", Frank Belknap Long, who had died in January 1994.\nBloch was cremated and his ashes interred in the Room of Prayer columbarium at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery in Los Angeles. His wife Elly is also interred there.\nThe Robert Bloch Award is presented at the annual Necronomicon convention. Its recipient in 2013 was editor and scholar S.T. Joshi. The award is in the shape of the Shining Trapezohedron as described in H. P. Lovecraft's tale dedicated to Bloch, \"The Haunter of the Dark\".\nComic adaptations.\nA number of Bloch's works have been adapted in graphic form for comics. These include:\nThe comic \"Aardwolf\" (No 2, Feb 1995) is a special tribute issue to Bloch. It contains brief tributes to Bloch from Harlan Ellison, Ray Bradbury, Richard Matheson, Julius Schwartz and Peter Straub incorporated within a piece called \"Robert Bloch: A Retrospective\" compiled by Clifford Lawrence.

{"title": "Rachel_Carson", "label": "Writer", "text": "Rachel Louise Carson (May 27, 1907\u00a0\u2013 April 14, 1964) was an American marine biologist, author, and conservationist whose influential book \"Silent Spring\" (1962) and other writings are credited with advancing the global environmental movement.\nCarson began her career as an aquatic biologist in the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, and became a full-time nature writer in the 1950s. Her widely praised 1951 bestseller \"The Sea Around Us\" won her a U.S. National Book Award, recognition as a gifted writer and financial security. Her next book, \"The Edge of the Sea\", and the reissued version of her first book, \"Under the Sea Wind\", were also bestsellers. This sea trilogy explores the whole of ocean life from the shores to the depths. \nLate in the 1950s, Carson turned her attention to conservation, especially some problems she believed were caused by synthetic pesticides. The result was the book \"Silent Spring\" (1962), which brought environmental concerns to an unprecedented share of the American people. Although \"Silent Spring\" was met with fierce opposition by chemical companies, it spurred a reversal in national pesticide policy, which led to a nationwide ban on DDT and other pesticides. It also inspired a grassroots environmental movement that led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Carson was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Jimmy Carter.\nLife and work.\nEarly life and education.\nRachel Carson was born on May 27, 1907, on a family farm near Springdale, Pennsylvania, just up the Allegheny River from Pittsburgh. She was the daughter of Maria Frazier (McLean) and Robert Warden Carson, an insurance salesman. She spent a lot of time exploring around her family's farm. An avid reader, she began writing stories (often involving animals) at age eight. She had her first story published at age ten. She especially enjoyed the \"St. Nicholas Magazine\" (which carried her first published stories), the works of Beatrix Potter, and the novels of Gene Stratton-Porter, and in her teen years, Herman Melville, Joseph Conrad and Robert Louis Stevenson. The natural world, particularly the ocean, was the common thread of her favorite literature. Carson attended Springdale's small school through tenth grade, then completed high school in nearby Parnassus, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1925 at the top of her class of forty-four students.\nAt the Pennsylvania College for Women (today known as Chatham University), as in high school, Carson was somewhat of a loner. She originally studied English but switched her major to biology in January 1928. However, she continued contributing to the school's student newspaper and literary supplement. Though admitted to graduate standing at Johns Hopkins University in 1928, she was forced to remain at the Pennsylvania College for Women for her senior year due to financial difficulties; she graduated \"magna cum laude\" in 1929. After a summer course at the Marine Biological Laboratory, she continued her studies in zoology and genetics at Johns Hopkins in the fall of 1929.\nAfter her first year of graduate school, Carson became a part-time student, taking an assistantship in Raymond Pearl's laboratory, where she worked with rats and \"Drosophila\", to earn money for tuition. After false starts with pit vipers and squirrels, she completed a dissertation project on the embryonic development of the pronephros in fish. She earned a master's degree in zoology in June 1932. She had intended to continue for a doctorate. However, in 1934 Carson was forced to leave Johns Hopkins to search for a full-time teaching position to help support her family during the Great Depression. In 1935, her father died suddenly, worsening their already critical financial situation and leaving Carson to care for her aging mother. At the urging of her undergraduate biology mentor Mary Scott Skinker, she settled for a temporary position with the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, writing radio copy for a series of weekly educational broadcasts entitled \"Romance Under the Waters\". The series of 52 seven-minute programs focused on aquatic life and was intended to generate public interest in fish biology and the bureau's work, a task the several writers before Carson had not managed. Carson also began submitting articles on marine life in the Chesapeake Bay, based on her research for the series, to local newspapers and magazines.\nCarson's supervisor, pleased with the success of the radio series, asked her to write the introduction to a public brochure about the fisheries bureau; he also worked to secure her the first full-time position that became available. Sitting for the civil service exam, she outscored all other applicants and, in 1936, became the second woman hired by the Bureau of Fisheries for a full-time professional position, as a junior aquatic biologist.\nEarly career and publications.\nAt the U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, Carson's primary responsibilities were to analyze and report field data on fish populations and write brochures and other literature for the public. Using her research and consultations with marine biologists as starting points, she also wrote a steady stream of articles for \"The Baltimore Sun\" and other newspapers. However, her family responsibilities further increased in January 1937 when her older sister died, leaving Carson as the sole breadwinner for her mother and two nieces.\nIn July 1937, the \"Atlantic Monthly\" accepted a revised version of an essay, \"The World of Waters\", that she originally wrote for her first fisheries bureau brochure. Her supervisor had deemed it too good for that purpose. The essay, published as \"Undersea\", was a vivid narrative of a journey along the ocean floor. It marked a major turning point in Carson's writing career. Publishing house Simon &amp; Schuster, impressed by \"Undersea\", contacted Carson and suggested that she expand it into a book. Several years of writing resulted in \"Under the Sea Wind\" (1941), which received excellent reviews but sold poorly. In the meantime, Carson's article-writing success continued\u2014her features appeared in \"Sun Magazine\", \"Nature\", and \"Collier's\". Carson attempted to leave the Bureau (by then transformed into the United States Fish and Wildlife Service) in 1945. However, few jobs for naturalists were available, as most money for science was focused on technical fields in the wake of the Manhattan Project. In mid-1945, Carson first encountered the subject of DDT, a revolutionary new pesticide\u2014lauded as the \"insect bomb\" after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki\u2014that was only beginning to undergo tests for safety and ecological effects. DDT was but one of Carson's many writing interests at the time, and editors found the subject unappealing; she published nothing on DDT until 1962.\nCarson rose within the Fish and Wildlife Service, by 1945 supervising a small writing staff and in 1949 becoming chief editor of publications. Her position provided increasing opportunities for fieldwork and freedom in choosing her writing projects; however, it also entailed increasingly tedious administrative responsibilities. By 1948, Carson was working on material for a second book and had made the conscious decision to begin a transition to writing full-time. That year, she took on a literary agent, Marie Rodell; they formed a close professional relationship that would last the rest of Carson's career.\nOxford University Press expressed interest in Carson's book proposal for a life history of the ocean, spurring her to complete by early 1950 the manuscript of what would become \"The Sea Around Us\". Chapters appeared in \"Science Digest\" and \"The Yale Review\"\u2014the latter chapter, \"The Birth of an Island,\" winning the American Association for the Advancement of Science's George Westinghouse Science Writing Prize. Nine chapters were serialized in \"The New Yorker\" beginning June 1951. The book was published July 2, 1951, by Oxford University Press. \"The Sea Around Us\" remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 86 weeks, was abridged by \"Reader's Digest\", won the 1952 National Book Award for Nonfiction and the John Burroughs Medal, and resulted in Carson's being awarded two honorary doctorates. She also licensed a documentary film based on it. \"The Sea\" success led to the republication of \"Under the Sea Wind\", which became a bestseller itself. With success came financial security, and in 1952 Carson was able to give up her job in order to concentrate on writing full-time.\nCarson was inundated with speaking engagements, fan mail and other correspondence regarding \"The Sea Around Us\", along with work on the script that she had secured the right to review. She was very unhappy with the final version of the script by writer, director, and producer Irwin Allen; she found it untrue to the atmosphere of the book and scientifically embarrassing, describing it as \"a cross between a believe-it-or-not and a breezy travelogue.\" However, she discovered that her right to review the script did not extend to any control over its content. This led to many scientific inconsistencies inside the film. Despite Carson's requests to resolve these problems, Allen went forward with the script. He succeeded in producing a very successful documentary. It went on to win the 1953 Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. However, Carson was so embittered by the experience that she never again sold film rights to her work.\nRelationship with Dorothy Freeman.\nCarson first met Dorothy Freeman in the summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine. Freeman had written to Carson welcoming her to the area when she had heard that the famous author was to become her neighbor. It was the beginning of an extremely close friendship that would last the rest of Carson's life. Their relationship was conducted mainly through letters and during summers spent together in Maine. Over 12 years, they would exchange somewhere in the region of 900 letters. Many of these were published in the book \"Always, Rachel\", published in 1995 by Beacon Press.\nCarson's biographer, Linda J. Lear, writes that \"Carson sorely needed a devoted friend and kindred spirit who would listen to her without advising and accept her wholly, the writer as well as the woman.\" She found this in Freeman. The two women had several common interests, nature chief among them, and began exchanging letters regularly while apart. They would share summers for the remainder of Carson's life and meet whenever else their schedules permitted.\nIn regard to the extent of their relationship, commentators have said that: \"the expression of their love was limited almost wholly to letters and very occasional farewell kisses or holding of hands\". Freeman shared parts of Carson's letters with her husband to help him understand the relationship, but much of their correspondence was carefully guarded. Some believe Freeman and Carson's relationship was romantic in nature. One of the letters from Carson to Freeman reads: \u201cBut, oh darling, I want to be with you so terribly that it hurts!\u201d, while in another, Freeman writes: \u201cI love you beyond expression... My love is boundless as the Sea.\u201d Carson's last letter to Freeman before her death ends with: \"Never forget, dear one, how deeply I have loved you all these years.\"\nShortly before Carson's death, she and Freeman destroyed hundreds of letters. The surviving correspondence was published in 1995 as \"Always, Rachel: The Letters of Rachel Carson and Dorothy Freeman, 1952\u20131964: An Intimate Portrait of a Remarkable Friendship\", edited by Martha Freeman, Dorothy's granddaughter, who wrote at publication: \"A few comments in early letters indicate that Rachel and Dorothy were initially cautious about the romantic tone and terminology of their correspondence. I believe this caution prompted their destruction of some letters within the first two years of their friendship...\" According to one reviewer, the pair \"fit Carolyn Heilbrun's characterization of a strong female friendship, where what matters is 'not whether friends are homosexual or heterosexual, lovers or not, but whether they share the wonderful energy of work in the public sphere.'\"\nAccording to her biographer, Linda Lear, there was some disagreement about the funeral arrangements for Rachel. Her brother, Robert Carson, insisted that her cremated remains be buried beside their mother in Maryland. This was against her wishes to be buried in Maine. In the end, a compromise was reached. Carson's wishes were carried out by an organizing committee, including her agent (Marie Rodell), her editor (Paul Brooks), and Dorothy Freeman. In the spring of 1964, Dorothy received half of Rachel's ashes in the mail sent to her by Robert Carson. In the summer of that year, Dorothy carried out Rachel's final wishes, scattering her ashes along the rocky shores of Sheepscot Bay in Maine.\n\"The Edge of the Sea\" and transition to conservation work.\nEarly in 1953, Carson began library and field research on the ecology and organisms of the Atlantic shore. In 1955, she completed the third volume of her sea trilogy, \"The Edge of the Sea\", which focuses on life in coastal ecosystems, particularly along the Eastern Seaboard. It appeared in \"The New Yorker\" in two condensed installments shortly before its October 26 book release by Houghton Mifflin (again a new publisher). By this time, Carson's reputation for clear and poetical prose was well established; \"The Edge of the Sea\" received highly favorable reviews, if not quite as enthusiastic as for \"The Sea Around Us\".\nThrough 1955 and 1956, Carson worked on several projects\u2014including the script for an \"Omnibus\" episode, \"Something About the Sky\"\u2014and wrote articles for popular magazines. Her plan for the next book was to address evolution. However, the publication of Julian Huxley's \"Evolution in Action\"\u2014and her own difficulty in finding a clear and compelling approach to the topic\u2014led her to abandon the project. Instead, her interests were turning to conservation. She considered an environment-themed book project tentatively titled \"Remembrance of the Earth\" and became involved with The Nature Conservancy and other conservation groups. She also made plans to buy and preserve from development an area in Maine she and Freeman called the \"Lost Woods.\"\nIn early 1957, a family tragedy struck for the third time when one of her nieces she had cared for since the 1940s died at the age of 31, leaving her 5-year-old son, Roger Christie, an orphan. Carson took on the responsibility for Roger when she adopted him, along with caring for her aging mother. Carson moved to Silver Spring, Maryland to care for Roger and spent much of 1957 putting together a new living situation and studying specific environmental threats.\nBy late 1957, Carson was closely following federal proposals for widespread pesticide spraying; the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) planned to eradicate fire ants. Other spraying programs involving chlorinated hydrocarbons and organophosphates were on the rise. For the rest of her life, Carson's main professional focus would be the dangers of pesticide overuse.\n\"Silent Spring\".\n\"Silent Spring\", Carson's best-known book, was published by Houghton Mifflin on September 27, 1962. The book described the harmful effects of pesticides on the environment, and is widely credited with helping launch the environmental movement. Carson was not the first or the only person to raise concerns about DDT, but her combination of \"scientific knowledge and poetic writing\" reached a broad audience and helped to focus opposition to DDT use. In 1994, an edition of \"Silent Spring\" was published with an introduction written by Vice President Al Gore. In 2012 \"Silent Spring \"was designated a National Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society for its role in the development of the modern environmental movement.\nResearch and writing.\nStarting in the mid-1940s, Carson had become concerned about the use of synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. However, the United States federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program prompted Carson to devote her research and her next book to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a lawsuit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.\nThe Audubon Naturalist Society also actively opposed such spraying programs and recruited Carson to help make public the government's exact spraying practices and the related research. Carson began the four-year project of what would become \"Silent Spring\" by gathering examples of environmental damage attributed to DDT. She also attempted to enlist others to join the cause, such as essayist E. B. White and several journalists and scientists. By 1958, Carson had arranged a book deal, with plans to co-write with \"Newsweek\" science journalist Edwin Diamond. However, when \"The New Yorker\" commissioned a long and well-paid article on the topic from Carson, she began considering writing more than simply the introduction and conclusion as planned; soon, it was a solo project. (Diamond would later write one of the harshest critiques of \"Silent Spring\").\nAs her research progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and environmental effects of pesticides. She also took advantage of her connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson found two scientific camps when it came to pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.\nShe also found significant support and extensive evidence from a group of biodynamic agriculture organic market gardeners, their adviser, Dr. Ehrenfried Pfeiffer, other contacts, and their suite of legal actions (1957-1960) against the U.S. Government. According to recent research by Paull (2013), this may have been the primary and (for strategic reasons) uncredited source for Carson's book. Marjorie Spock and Mary T. Richards of Long Island, New York, contested the aerial spraying of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). They compiled their evidence and shared it with Carson, who used it, their extensive contacts, and the trial transcripts as a primary input for \"Silent Spring\". Carson wrote of the content as \"a gold mine of information\" and says, \"I feel guilty about the mass of your material I have here\" and makes multiple references to Pfeiffer and his correspondence.\nBy 1959, the USDA's Agricultural Research Service responded to the criticism by Carson and others with a public service film, \"Fire Ant on Trial\"; Carson characterized it as \"flagrant propaganda\" that ignored the dangers that spraying pesticides (especially dieldrin and heptachlor) posed to humans and wildlife. That spring, Carson wrote a letter, published in \"The Washington Post\", that attributed the recent decline in bird populations\u2014in her words, the \"silencing of birds\"\u2014to pesticide overuse. That was also the year of the \"Great Cranberry Scandal\": the 1957, 1958, and 1959 crops of U.S. cranberries were found to contain high levels of the herbicide aminotriazole (which caused cancer in laboratory rats), and the sale of all cranberry products was halted. Carson attended the subsequent FDA hearings on revising pesticide regulations; she came away discouraged by the aggressive tactics of the chemical industry representatives, which included expert testimony that was firmly contradicted by the bulk of the scientific literature she had been studying. She also wondered about the possible \"financial inducements behind certain pesticide programs.\"\nResearch at the Library of Medicine of the National Institutes of Health brought Carson into contact with medical researchers investigating the gamut of cancer-causing chemicals. Of particular significance was the work of National Cancer Institute researcher and environmental cancer section founding director Wilhelm Hueper, who classified many pesticides as carcinogens. Carson and her research assistant Jeanne Davis, with the help of NIH librarian Dorothy Algire, found evidence to support the pesticide-cancer connection; to Carson, the evidence for the toxicity of a wide array of synthetic pesticides was clear-cut, though such conclusions were very controversial beyond the small community of scientists studying pesticide carcinogenesis.\nBy 1960, Carson had more than enough research material, and the writing was progressing rapidly. In addition to the thorough literature search, she had investigated hundreds of individual incidents of pesticide exposure and the human sickness and ecological damage that resulted. However, in January, a duodenal ulcer followed by several infections kept her bedridden for weeks, greatly delaying the completion of \"Silent Spring\". As she was nearing full recovery in March (just as she was completing drafts of the two cancer chapters of her book), she discovered cysts in her left breast, one of which necessitated a mastectomy. Though her doctor described the procedure as precautionary and recommended no further treatment, by December, Carson discovered that the tumor was malignant and the cancer had metastasized. Her research was also delayed by revision work for a new edition of \"The Sea Around Us\" and by a collaborative photo essay with Erich Hartmann. Most of the research and writing was done by the fall of 1960, except for the discussion of recent research on biological pest controls and investigations of a handful of new pesticides. However, further health troubles slowed the final revisions in 1961 and early 1962. While writing the book, Carson chose to hide her illness so that the pesticide companies could not use it against her (she worried that if the companies knew, they would use it as ammunition to make her book look untrustworthy and biased).\nFinding a title for the book proved difficult; \"Silent Spring\" was initially suggested as a title for the chapter on birds. By August 1961, Carson finally agreed to the suggestion of her literary agent Marie Rodell: \"Silent Spring\" would be a metaphorical title for the entire book, suggesting a bleak future for the whole natural world, rather than a single chapter title about the literal absence of birdsong. With Carson's approval, editor Paul Brooks at Houghton Mifflin arranged for illustrations by Louis and Lois Darling, who also designed the cover. The final writing was the first chapter, \"A Fable for Tomorrow\", which Carson intended as a gentle introduction to what might otherwise be a forbiddingly serious topic. By mid-1962, Brooks and Carson had essentially finished the editing and were laying the groundwork for promoting the book by sending the manuscript out to select individuals for final suggestions.\nContent.\nAs biographer Mark Hamilton Lytle writes, Carson \"quite self-consciously decided to write a book calling into question the paradigm of scientific progress that defined post-war American culture.\" The overriding theme of \"Silent Spring\" is the powerful\u2014and often adverse\u2014effect humans have on the natural world.\nCarson's main argument is that pesticides have detrimental effects on the environment; they are more properly termed \"biocides\", she argues, because their effects are rarely limited to the target pests. DDT is a prime example, but other synthetic pesticides come under scrutiny, many of which are subject to bioaccumulation. Carson also accuses the chemical industry of intentionally spreading disinformation and public officials of accepting industry claims uncritically. Most of the book is devoted to pesticides' effects on natural ecosystems. However, four chapters also detail cases of human pesticide poisoning, cancer, and other illnesses attributed to pesticides. About DDT and cancer, the subject of so much subsequent debate, Carson says only a little:\nCarson predicted increased consequences in the future, especially as targeted pests develop pesticide resistance. At the same time, weakened ecosystems fall prey to unanticipated invasive species. The book closes with a call for a biotic approach to pest control as an alternative to chemical pesticides.\nIn regards to the pesticide DDT, Carson never actually called for an outright ban. Part of the argument she made in \"Silent Spring\" was that even if DDT and other insecticides had \"no\" environmental side effects, their indiscriminate overuse was counter-productive because it would create insect resistance to the pesticide(s), making the pesticides useless in eliminating the target insect populations:\nCarson further noted that \"Malaria programmes are threatened by resistance among mosquitoes\" and emphasized the advice given by the director of Holland's Plant Protection Service: \"Practical advice should be 'Spray as little as you possibly can' rather than 'Spray to the limit of your capacity' ... Pressure on the pest population should always be as slight as possible.\"\nPromotion and reception.\nCarson and the others involved with the publication of \"Silent Spring\" expected fierce criticism. They were particularly concerned about the possibility of being sued for libel. Carson was also undergoing radiation therapy to combat her spreading cancer and expected to have little energy to devote to defending her work and responding to critics. In preparation for the anticipated attacks, Carson and her agent attempted to amass as many prominent supporters as possible before the book's release.\nMost of the book's scientific chapters were reviewed by scientists with relevant expertise, among whom Carson found strong support. Carson attended the White House Conference on Conservation in May 1962; Houghton Mifflin distributed proof copies of \"Silent Spring\" to many of the delegates and promoted the upcoming \"New Yorker\" serialization. Among many others, Carson also sent a proof copy to Supreme Court Associate Justice William O. Douglas, a longtime environmental advocate who had argued against the court's rejection of the Long Island pesticide spraying case (and who had provided Carson with some of the material included in her chapter on herbicides).\nThough \"Silent Spring\" had generated a relatively high level of interest based on pre-publication promotion, this became much more intense with the serialization in \"The New Yorker\", which began on June 16, 1962, issue. This brought the book to the attention of the chemical industry and its lobbyists and a wide swath of the American populace. Around that time, Carson also learned that \"Silent Spring\" had been selected as the Book of the Month for October; as she put it, this would \"carry it to farms and hamlets all over that country that don't know what a bookstore looks like\u2014much less \"The New Yorker\".\" Other publicity included a positive editorial in \"The New York Times\" and excerpts of the serialized version in \"Audubon\" magazine, with another round of publicity in July and August as chemical companies responded. The story of the birth defect-causing drug thalidomide broke just before the book's publication as well, inviting comparisons between Carson and Frances Oldham Kelsey, the Food and Drug Administration reviewer who had blocked the drug's sale in the United States.\nIn the weeks leading up to the September 27, 1962, publication, there was strong opposition to \"Silent Spring\" from the chemical industry. DuPont (a main manufacturer of DDT and 2,4-D) and Velsicol Chemical Corporation (exclusive manufacturer of chlordane and heptachlor) were among the first to respond. DuPont compiled an extensive report on the book's press coverage and estimated impact on public opinion. Velsicol threatened legal action against Houghton Mifflin and \"The New Yorker\" and \"Audubon\" unless the planned \"Silent Spring\" features were canceled. Chemical industry representatives and lobbyists also lodged a range of non-specific complaints, some anonymously. Chemical companies and associated organizations produced a number of their own brochures and articles promoting and defending pesticide use. However, Carson's and the publishers' lawyers were confident in the vetting process \"Silent Spring\" had undergone. The magazine and book publications proceeded as planned, as did the large Book-of-the-Month printing (which included a pamphlet endorsing the book by William O. Douglas).\nAmerican Cyanamid biochemist Robert White-Stevens and former Cyanamid chemist Thomas Jukes were among the most aggressive critics, especially of Carson's analysis of DDT. According to White-Stevens, \"If man were to follow the teachings of Miss Carson, we would return to the Dark Ages, and the insects and diseases and vermin would once again inherit the earth.\" Others went further, attacking Carson's scientific credentials (because her training was in marine biology rather than biochemistry) and her character. White-Stevens labeled her \"...a fanatic defender of the cult of the balance of nature,\" while former U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Ezra Taft Benson, in a letter to former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, reportedly concluded that because she was unmarried despite being physically attractive, she was \"probably a Communist.\"\nMany critics repeatedly asserted that she was calling for the elimination of all pesticides. However, Carson had made it clear she was not advocating the banning or complete withdrawal of helpful pesticides but was instead encouraging responsible and carefully managed use with an awareness of the chemicals' impact on the entire ecosystem. In fact, she concludes her section on DDT in \"Silent Spring\" not by urging a total ban but with advice for spraying as little as possible to limit the development of resistance.\nThe academic community, including prominent defenders such as H. J. Muller, Loren Eiseley, Clarence Cottam, and Frank Egler, by and large, backed the book's scientific claims; public opinion soon turned Carson's way as well. The chemical industry campaign backfired, as the controversy greatly increased public awareness of potential pesticide dangers, as well as \"Silent Spring\" book sales. Pesticide use became a major public issue, especially after the \"CBS Reports\" TV special \"The Silent Spring of Rachel Carson\" that aired April 3, 1963. The program included segments of Carson reading from \"Silent Spring\" and interviews with several other experts, mostly critics (including White-Stevens); according to biographer Linda Lear, \"in juxtaposition to the wild-eyed, loud-voiced Dr. Robert White-Stevens in white lab coat, Carson appeared anything but the hysterical alarmist that her critics contended.\" Reactions from the estimated audience of ten to fifteen million were overwhelmingly positive, and the program spurred a congressional review of pesticide dangers and the public release of a pesticide report by the President's Science Advisory Committee. Within a year or so of publication, the attacks on the book and Carson had largely lost momentum.\nIn one of her last public appearances, Carson testified before President John F. Kennedy's Science Advisory Committee. The committee issued its report on May 15, 1963, largely backing Carson's scientific claims. Following the report's release, she also testified before a United States Senate subcommittee to make policy recommendations. Though Carson received hundreds of other speaking invitations, she could not accept the great majority of them. Her health was steadily declining as her cancer outpaced the radiation therapy, with only brief periods of remission. She spoke as much as she was physically able, however, including a notable appearance on \"The Today Show\" and speeches at several dinners held in her honor. In late 1963, she received a flurry of awards and honors: the Audubon Medal (from the National Audubon Society), the Cullum Geographical Medal (from the American Geographical Society), and induction into the American Academy of Arts and Letters.\nDeath.\nWeakened from breast cancer and her treatment regimen, Carson became ill with a respiratory virus in January 1964. Her condition worsened, and in February, doctors found that she had severe anemia from her radiation treatments and in March they discovered that the cancer had reached her liver. She died of a heart attack on April 14, 1964, in her home in Silver Spring, Maryland.\nHer body was cremated and the ashes buried beside her mother at Parklawn Memorial Gardens, Rockville, Maryland. Some of her ashes were later scattered along the coast of Southport Island, near Sheepscot Bay, Maine.\nLegacy.\nCollected papers and posthumous publications.\nCarson bequeathed her manuscripts and papers to Yale University to take advantage of the new state-of-the-art preservations facilities of the Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. Her longtime agent and literary executor Marie Rodell spent nearly two years organizing and cataloging Carson's papers and correspondence, distributing all the letters to their senders so that only what each correspondent approved would be submitted to the archive.\nIn 1965, Rodell arranged for the publication of an essay Carson had intended to expand into a book: \"The Sense of Wonder\". The essay, which was combined with photographs by Charles Pratt and others, exhorts parents to help their children experience the \"...lasting pleasures of contact with the natural world ... available to anyone who will place himself under the influence of earth, sea, and sky and their amazing life.\"\nIn addition to the letters in \"Always Rachel\", in 1998, a volume of Carson's previously unpublished work was published as \"Lost Woods: The Discovered Writing of Rachel Carson\", edited by Linda Lear. All of Carson's books remain in print.\nGrassroots environmentalism and the EPA.\nCarson's work had a powerful impact on the environmental movement. \"Silent Spring\", in particular, was a rallying point for the fledgling social movement in the 1960s. According to environmental engineer and Carson scholar H. Patricia Hynes, \"\"Silent Spring\" altered the balance of power in the world. No one since would be able to sell pollution as the necessary underside of progress so easily or uncritically.\" Carson's work, and the activism it inspired, are at least partly responsible for the deep ecology movement and the overall strength of the grassroots environmental movement since the 1960s. It was also influential on the rise of ecofeminism and on many feminist scientists.\nWhile there remains no evidence that Carson was openly a women's rights activist, her work and its subsequent criticisms have left an iconic legacy for the ecofeminist movement. Attacks on Carson's credibility included criticism of her credentials in which she was labeled an \"amateur.\" It was said that her writing was too \"emotional.\" Ecofeminist scholars argue that not only was the dissenting rhetoric gendered to paint Carson as hysterical but was done because her arguments challenged the capitalist production of large agri-business corporations. Others, such as Yaakov Garb, suggest that in addition to not being a women's rights activist, Carson also had no anti-capitalist agenda and that such attacks were unwarranted. Additionally, the way photos of Carson were used to portray her are often questioned because of few representations of her engaging in work typical of a scientist, but instead of her leisure activities.\nCarson's most direct legacy in the environmental movement was the campaign to ban DDT in the United States (and related efforts to ban or limit its use throughout the world). Though environmental concerns about DDT had been considered by government agencies as early as Carson's testimony before the President's Science Advisory Committee, the 1967 formation of the Environmental Defense Fund was the first significant milestone in the campaign against DDT. The organization brought lawsuits against the government to \"establish a citizen's right to a clean environment,\" and the arguments employed against DDT largely mirrored Carson's. By 1972, the Environmental Defense Fund and other activist groups had succeeded in securing a phase-out of DDT use in the United States (except in emergency cases).\nThe creation of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) by the Nixon Administration in 1970 addressed another concern that Carson had brought to light. Until then, the same agency (the USDA) was responsible both for regulating pesticides and promoting the concerns of the agriculture industry; Carson saw this as a conflict of interest since the agency was not responsible for effects on wildlife or other environmental concerns beyond farm policy. Fifteen years after its creation, one journalist described the EPA as \"the extended shadow of \"Silent Spring\".\" Much of the agency's early work, such as enforcing the 1972 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, was directly related to Carson's work.\nIn the 1980s, the policies of the Reagan Administration emphasized economic growth, rolling back many of the environmental policies adopted in response to Carson and her work.\nPosthumous honors.\nVarious groups ranging from government institutions to environmental and conservation organizations to scholarly societies have celebrated Carson's life and work since her death. Perhaps most significantly, on June 9, 1980, Carson was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian honor in the United States. A 17\u00a2 Great Americans series postage stamp was issued in her honor the following year; several other countries have since issued Carson postage as well. In 1973, Carson was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame.\nThe University of California, Santa Cruz, named one of its colleges (formerly known as College Eight) Rachel Carson College in 2016. Rachel Carson College is the first college at the University to bear a woman's name.\nMunich's Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society was founded in 2009. An international, interdisciplinary center for research and education in the environmental humanities and social sciences, it was established as a joint initiative of Munich's Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t and the Deutsches Museum, with the support of the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research.\nCarson's birthplace and childhood home in Springdale, Pennsylvania, now known as the Rachel Carson Homestead, became a National Register of Historic Places site and the nonprofit Rachel Carson Homestead Association was created in 1975 to manage it. Her home in Colesville, Maryland where she wrote \"Silent Spring\" was named a National Historic Landmark in 1991. Near Pittsburgh, a hiking trail, called the Rachel Carson Trail and maintained by the Rachel Carson Trails Conservancy, was dedicated to Carson in 1975. A Pittsburgh bridge was also renamed in Carson's honor as the Rachel Carson Bridge. The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection State Office Building in Harrisburg is named in her honor. Elementary schools in Gaithersburg, Montgomery County, Maryland, Sammamish, Washington and San Jose, California were named in her honor, as were middle schools in Beaverton, Oregon and Herndon, Virginia (Rachel Carson Middle School), and a high school in Brooklyn, New York.\nTwo research vessels have sailed in the United States bearing the name R/V \"Rachel Carson\". One is on the west coast, owned by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), and the other is on the east coast, operated by the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. Another vessel of the name, now scrapped, was a former naval vessel obtained and converted by the United States EPA. It operated on the Great Lakes. The Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary also operates a mooring buoy maintenance vessel named the Rachel Carson.\nThe ceremonial auditorium on the third floor of EPA headquarters, the William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building, is named after Carson. The Rachel Carson Room is close to the EPA Administrator's office. It has been the site of numerous important announcements, including the Clean Air Interstate Rule.\nA number of conservation areas have been named for Carson as well. Between 1964 and 1990, 650 acres (263\u00a0ha) near Brookeville in Montgomery County, Maryland were acquired and set aside as the Rachel Carson Conservation Park, administered by the Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission. In 1969, the Coastal Maine National Wildlife Refuge became the Rachel Carson National Wildlife Refuge; expansions will bring the size of the refuge to about 9,125 acres (3,693\u00a0ha). In 1985, North Carolina renamed one of its estuarine reserves in honor of Carson, in Beaufort.\nCarson is also a frequent namesake for prizes awarded by philanthropic, educational and scholarly institutions. The Rachel Carson Prize, founded in Stavanger, Norway in 1991, is awarded to women who have made a contribution in the field of environmental protection. The American Society for Environmental History has awarded the Rachel Carson Prize for Best Dissertation since 1993. Since 1998, the Society for Social Studies of Science has awarded an annual Rachel Carson Book Prize for \"a book length work of social or political relevance in the area of science and technology studies.\" The Society of Environmental Journalists gives an annual award and two honourable mentions for books on environmental issues in Carson's name, such as was awarded to Joe Roman's \"\" in 2012. The Sierra Club and its foundation recognize donors who have provided for the club in their estate plans as the Rachel Carson Society. The Rachel Carson Center for Environment and Society at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (Germany) awards post-doctoral fellowships in the area of the environment and society.\nThe \"Rachel Carson\" sculpture in Woods Hole, Massachusetts was unveiled on July 14, 2013. Google created a Google Doodle for Carson's 107th birthday on May 27, 2014. Carson was featured during the \"HerStory\" video tribute to notable women on U2's tour in 2017 for the 30th anniversary of \"The Joshua Tree\" during a performance of \"Ultraviolet (Light My Way)\" from the band's 1991 album \"Achtung Baby\".\nCentennial events.\nThe centennial of Carson's birth occurred in 2007. On Earth Day (April 22), \"Courage for the Earth: Writers, Scientists, and Activists Celebrate the Life and Writing of Rachel Carson\" was released as \"a centennial appreciation of Rachel Carson's brave life and transformative writing.\" It contained thirteen essays by environmental writers and scientists. Democratic Senator Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland had intended to submit a resolution celebrating Carson for her \"legacy of scientific rigor coupled with poetic sensibility\" on the 100th anniversary of her birth. The resolution was blocked by Republican Senator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma. The Rachel Carson Homestead Association held a May 27 birthday party and sustainable feast at her birthplace and home in Springdale, Pennsylvania, and the first Rachel Carson Legacy Conference in Pittsburgh with E. O. Wilson as keynote speaker. Both Rachel's Sustainable Feast and the conference continue as annual events.\nAlso in 2007 American author Ginger Wadsworth wrote a biography of Carson.\nExternal links.\nCarson-related organizations"}
{"title": "Lu\u00eds_de_Cam\u00f5es", "label": "Writer", "text": "Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es (; sometimes rendered in English as Camoens or Camo\u00ebns, ; c. 1524 or 1525 \u2013 10 June 1580) is considered Portugal's and the Portuguese language's greatest poet. His mastery of verse has been compared to that of Shakespeare, Vondel, Homer, Virgil and Dante. He wrote a considerable amount of lyrical poetry and drama but is best remembered for his epic work \"Os Lus\u00edadas\" (\"The Lusiads\"). His collection of poetry \"The Parnasum of Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es\" was lost during his life. The influence of his masterpiece \"Os Lus\u00edadas\" is so profound that Portuguese is sometimes called the \"language of Cam\u00f5es\".\nThe day of his death, 10 June OS, is Portugal's national day.\nLife.\nOrigins and youth.\nMuch of the information about Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es' biography raises doubts and, probably, much of what circulates about him is nothing more than the typical folklore that is formed around a famous figure. Only a few dates are documented that guide its trajectory. The ancestral home of the Cam\u00f5es family had its origins in the Kingdom of Galicia, not far from Cape Finisterre. On his paternal side, Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es was descended from Vasco Pires de Cam\u00f5es, Galician troubadour, warrior and fidalgo, who moved to Portugal in 1370 and received great benefits from the king in positions, honours and lands, and whose poetry, of a nationalist nature, contributed to ward off Breton and Italian influence and to shape a national troubadour style. His son Ant\u00e3o Vaz de Cam\u00f5es served in the Red Sea and married Dona Guiomar da Gama, related to Vasco da Gama. From this marriage were born Sim\u00e3o Vaz de Cam\u00f5es, who served in the Royal Navy and did trade in Guinea and India, and another brother, Bento, who followed the career of a man of letters and entered the priesthood, joining the Austin friars at the Monastery of Santa Cruz, which was a prestigious school for many young Portuguese gentlemen. Sim\u00e3o married Dona Ana de S\u00e1 e Macedo, also from a noble family, from Santar\u00e9m. Her only son, Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es, according to Jayne, Fernandes and some other authors, was born in Lisbon in 1524. Three years later, the city is being threatened by the plague, the family moved, following the court, to Coimbra. However, other cities claim the honour of being his birthplace: Coimbra, Santar\u00e9m and Alenquer. Although the first biographers of Cam\u00f5es, Severin de Faria and Manoel Correa, initially gave his year of birth as 1517, records of the Lists of the Casa da \u00cdndia, later consulted by Manuel de Faria e Sousa, seem to establish that Cam\u00f5es was actually born in Lisbon, in 1524. The arguments for placing his birth outside of Lisbon are weak; but neither is it completely beyond doubt, so the most recent scholarship considers his place and date of birth uncertain.\nAbout his childhood much remains unknown. At twelve or thirteen he would have been protected and educated by his uncle Bento, who sent him to Coimbra to study. Tradition says that he was an undisciplined student, but eager for knowledge, interested in history, cosmography and classic and modern literature. However, his name does not appear in the records of the University of Coimbra, but it is certain from his elaborate style and the profusion of erudite quotes that appear in his works that in some way he received a solid education. It is possible that his uncle himself, a chancellor of the university and the prior of the Monastery of Santa Cruz, instructed him or that he studied at the monastery college. At about twenty years of age he probably moved to Lisbon, before completing his studies. His family was poor, but being noble, he could be admitted to the court of John III where he established fruitful intellectual contacts and began his career as a poet.\nIt was suggested that he earned his living as a preceptor of Francisco, son of the Count of Linhares, D. Ant\u00f3nio de Noronha, but this now seems hardly plausible. It is also said that he adopted a bohemian lifestyle, frequenting taverns and getting involved in tumultuous love affairs. Several ladies are cited by name in late biographies of the poet as having been the object of his affection, but those identifications are currently considered apocryphal additions to his legend. Among them, for example, there was talk of a passion for Infanta Dona Maria, sister of the king, but that audacity would have earned him time in prison. Another was Catarina de Ata\u00edde, with whom he allegedly had a frustrated love affair that resulted in his self-exile, first in Ribatejo, and then by enlisting as a soldier in Ceuta. The reason for the latter trip is doubtful, but the trip itself is accepted fact; he remained there two years and lost his right eye in a naval battle in the Strait of Gibraltar. Back in Lisbon, he wasted no time in resuming his bohemian life.\nA document dating from 1550 states that he had enlisted to travel to India: \"\"Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, son of Sim\u00e3o Vaz and Ana de S\u00e1, living in Lisbon, at Mouraria; squire, 25 years old, ginger bearded, brought his father as guarantor; goes on the ship of S. Pedro dos Burgaleses ... among the men-at-arms\". As it turns out, he didn't board immediately. In a Corpus Christi procession, he got into an altercation with a certain Gon\u00e7alo Borges, employee of the Royal Palace, and wounded him with a sword. Sentenced to prison, he later received a letter of pardon and was released by royal order on March 7, 1553, which says: \"he is a young man and poor and he is going to serve in India this year\"\". Manuel de Faria e Sousa found in the registers of the Armada of India, for that year 1553, under the title \"Gente de guerra\" (\"Men of war\"), the following statement: \"Fernando Casado, son of Manuel Casado and Branca Queimada, residents of Lisbon, squire; Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, son of Sim\u00e3o Vaz and Ana de S\u00e1, squire, took his place; and he received 2400 like the others\".\nCam\u00f5es set sail on Palm Sunday, the 24th of March 1553. His last words, he says in a letter, were those of Scipio Africanus, \u201cIngrata patria, non possidebis ossa mea\u201d (Ungrateful fatherland, you will not possess my bones).\nJourney to the East.\nHe traveled aboard the carrack S\u00e3o Bento, belonging to the fleet of Fern\u00e3o \u00c1lvares Cabral, which left the Tagus on March 24, 1553. During the trip he passed through the regions where Vasco da Gama had sailed, faced a storm in the Cape of Good Hope Cabo da Boa Esperan\u00e7a where the three other ships in the fleet were lost, and landed in Goa in 1554. Soon he enlisted in the service of the viceroy D. Afonso de Noronha and fought in the expedition against the king of Chemb\u00e9 (or \"da Pimenta\"). In 1555, Noronha's successor D. Pedro Mascarenhas ordered Manuel de Vasconcelos to fight the Moors in the Red Sea. Cam\u00f5es accompanied him, but the squadron did not find the enemy and went to winter in Ormuz, in the Persian Gulf.\nProbably at this time he had already started writing Os Lus\u00edadas. When he returned to Goa in 1556, he met D. Francisco Barreto in the government, and composed for him the \"Auto de Filodemo\", which suggests that Barreto looked upon Cam\u00f5es with favor. The early biographers, however, differ about Cam\u00f5es' relations with that ruler. At the same time, an anonymous satire criticizing the prevalence of immorality and corruption, which was attributed to Cam\u00f5es, also was published. Since satires were condemned by the Ordinances of King Manuel, Cam\u00f5es would have been arrested for that. But it has also been hypothesized that the arrest was actually for debts that Cam\u00f5es had incurred. It is possible that he remained in prison until 1561, and that he may have been convicted of additional offenses before then. At any rate, when D. Francisco Coutinho assumed the governship of India Cam\u00f5es was released and came under that man's employ and protection. He was appointed to the position of Superintendent for the Dead and Missing for Macau in 1562, serving \"de facto\" from 1563 until 1564 or 1565. At that time, Macau was a trading post still in formation and almost uninhabited. Tradition says that there he wrote part of Os Lus\u00edadas in a cave, which later was named after him.\nOn the trip back to Goa, he was shipwrecked, as tradition says, near the mouth of the Mekong River, managing to save only himself and the manuscript of Os Lus\u00edadas, an event that inspired the famous \"redondilha\" \"Sobre os rios que v\u00e3o\", considered by Ant\u00f3nio S\u00e9rgio the \"backbone\" of the Camonian lyric, as is repeatedly cited in the critical literature. The trauma of the shipwreck, in the words of Leal de Matos, had the most profound impact on redefining the themes of Os Lus\u00edadas, this being noticeable beginning with Canto VII, a fact already noted by Diogo do Couto, a friend of the poet who partly accompanied the work as it was being written.\nHis rescue took months to occur, and there is no record of how it happened, but he was taken to Malacca, where he received a new arrest warrant for misappropriating the assets of the dead that had been entrusted to him. The exact date of his return to Goa is not known, but he may have remained in prison there for some time. Couto says that in the shipwreck Dinamene, a Chinese maiden with whom Cam\u00f5es had fallen in love, died, but Ribeiro and others reject that story. The next viceroy, D. Ant\u00e3o de Noronha, was a longtime friend of Cam\u00f5es, having first met him during his Morocco adventure. Certain biographers claim that he was promised a position at the trading post at Chaul, but he did not take up the position. Severim de Faria said that the final years spent in Goa were occupied with poetry and military activities, where he always showed bravery, readiness and loyalty to the Crown.\nIt is difficult to determine what his daily life in the East would have been like, beyond what can be extrapolated from his military status. It seems certain that he always lived modestly and may have shared a house with friends, \"in one of those collective dwellings where it was customary for people from the homeland to associate\", as Ramalho notes. Some of these friends must have been in possession of a certain degree of culture and would have provided illustrious companionship. Ribeiro, Saraiva and Moura admit that he may have encountered, among other figures, Fern\u00e3o Mendes Pinto, Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado, Fern\u00e3o \u00c1lvares do Oriente, Garcia de Orta and the aforementioned Diogo do Couto, creating opportunities for debating literary topics and the like. He may also have attended lectures at one of Goa's colleges or religious establishments. Ribeiro adds that\n\"These fellows who lived in Goa, far from their homeland and family, between campaigns against the Turk (which took place in the summer) and many of them having little to do (in winter), in addition to the aforementioned lectures and constant readings (including many of the classics: Ovid, Horace, Virgil), enjoying the company of women and musical gatherings, living among themselves without regard to social distinctions, their main objective was to have fun as much as possible, even when writing poetry. Thus their predilection for satire, which had a strongly negative social impact and exposed them to imprisonment per the Manueline Ordinances (Title LXXIX), and therefore carried an edge of adventure and risk. An example of this is the \"Tournament Satire\", a mockery that is mentioned by Faria e Sousa and about which, unlike \"Os Disbarates da \u00cdndia\", there is no scholarly contestation of its Camonian authorship; it may in fact be the reason for one of Cam\u00f5es' arrests.\"\nAt such meetings the participants were both men-at-arms and men of letters, and were in search not only of military success and material fortune, but also of the fame and glory born of culture. This was one of the great aspirations of the Humanism of that era, and from it may have sprung the idea of creating an academy, reproducing within the limitations of the local context, the model of Renaissance academies such as the one founded in Florence by Marsilio Ficino and his circle, where Neoplatonic ideals were cultivated.\nReturn to Portugal.\nWhether it was by invitation, or simply a matter of taking the chance to bridge part of the distance that separated him from his homeland, it is not known for certain, but in December 1567 Cam\u00f5es embarked on Pedro Barreto's ship to Sofala, on the Island of Mozambique, where Barreto had been appointed governor, and there Cam\u00f5es would wait for transport to Lisbon at a future date. The early biographers say that Pedro Barreto was treacherous, making false promises to Cam\u00f5es, so that after two years Diogo do Couto found him in a precarious state:\n\"In Mozambique we found that Prince of Poets of his day, my companion and friend Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, so poor that he was dependent on friends to feed him. Upon embarking for the kingdom we gathered all the clothing that he needed, and there was no shortage of people who gave him to eat. And that winter that he was in Mozambique, having just finished his Lus\u00edadas in preparation for printing, he had been writing a great deal in another book which he entitled \"The Parnassus of Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es\", it being a book of great erudition, doctrine and philosophy, but which was stolen from him.\"\nWhile attempting to set sail with Couto, Cam\u00f5es found his departure embargoed in the amount of two hundred cruzados by Barreto, demanding reimbursement for monies spent on the poet's behalf. His friends, however, collected the amount and Cam\u00f5es was released, arriving in Cascais aboard the carrack \"Santa Clara\" on April 7, 1570.\nAfter so many adventures, he finally completed Os Lus\u00edadas, presenting them in recitation to Sebastian. The king, still a teenager, ordered the work to be published in 1572, also granting a small pension to \"Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, noble knight of my House\", in payment for services rendered in India. The value of the pension did not exceed fifteen thousand r\u00e9is a year, which, if not generous, was also not as miserly as has been suggested, considering that the Royal Palace's bridesmaids received around ten thousand r\u00e9is. For a veteran soldier, the sum must have been considered sufficient and honorable at the time. But the pension would've only lasted for three years, and although the grant was renewable, it seems that it was paid irregularly, causing the poet to experience material difficulties.\nCam\u00f5es lived out his final years in a room in a house near the Convent of Santa Ana, in a state, according to tradition, of the most unworthy poverty, \"without a rag to cover him\". Le Gentil considered this view a romantic exaggeration, as he was still able keep a slave named Jau, whom he had brought with him from the east, and official documents attest that he had some means of livelihood. After being embittered by the Portuguese defeat at the Battle of Alc\u00e1cer Quibir, in which Sebastian disappeared, leading Portugal to lose its independence to the Spanish crown, he was stricken by bubonic plague, according to Le Gentil. He was transported to a hospital and died on June 10, 1580, being buried, according to Faria e Sousa, in a shallow grave in the Convent of Santa Ana, or in the cemetery of the poor in the same hospital, according to Te\u00f3filo Braga. His mother, having survived him, began to receive his pension as an inheritance. The receipts, found at Torre do Tombo, the Portuguese national archive, document the date of the poet's death, although an epitaph written by D. Gon\u00e7alo Coutinho has been preserved which mistakenly assigns his death to the year 1579. After the 1755 earthquake which destroyed most of Lisbon, attempts were made to find the remains of Cam\u00f5es, but to no avail. The bones deposited in 1880 in a tomb in the Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery are, in all probability, someone else's.\nAppearance, character, loves and iconography.\nThe testimonies of his contemporaries describe him as a man of average size, with reddish blond hair, blind in his right eye, skilled in all physical exercises and with a temperamental disposition, having little difficulty in engaging in fights. It is said that he had great value as a soldier, exhibiting courage, combativeness, a sense of honor and willingness to serve, a good companion in his spare time, liberal, cheerful and witty when the blows of fortune did not overwhelm his spirit and saddened him. He was aware of his merit as a man, as a soldier and as a poet.\nAll efforts made to discover the definitive identity of his muse were in vain and several contradictory proposals were made about alleged women present in his life. Cam\u00f5es himself suggested, in one of his poems, that there were several muses to inspire him, when he said \"in various flames it was often burning\". Names of supposed ladies like their loved ones appear only primitively in his poems, and can therefore be ideal figures; no mention of any ladies identifiable by name is given in the poet's first biographies, those of Pedro de Mariz and that of Severim de Faria, who only collected rumors about \"some loves in Pa\u00e7o da Rainha\". Reference to Catarina de Ata\u00edde only appeared in the edition of Rimas de Faria e Sousa, in the middle of the 17th century and to Infanta on Jos\u00e9 Maria Rodrigues, which was only published in the early 20th century. The decanted Dinamene also appears to be a poetic image rather than a real person. Ribeiro proposed several alternatives to explain it: the name might have been a cryptonym of Dona Joana Meneses (DIna = D.Ioana + Mene), one of his possible loves, who died on the way to the Indies and was buried in the sea, daughter of Violante, countess of Linhares, whom he would also have loved in Portugal, and pointed out the occurrence of the name Dinamene in poems written probably around the arrival in India, before proceeding to China, where it is said that he would have found the girl. He also referred to the opinion of researchers who claim the mention of Couto, the only primitive reference to the Chinese outside of the Camonian work itself, to have been falsified, being introduced \"a posteriori\", with the possibility that it is even a spelling error, a corruption of \"dignamente\" (\"worthily\"). In the final version of Couto's manuscript, the name would not even have been cited, even though proving it is difficult with the disappearance of the manuscript.\nProbably executed between 1573 and 1575, the so-called \"portrait painted in red\", illustrated at the opening of the article, is considered by Vasco Gra\u00e7a Moura as \"the only and precious reliable document we have to know the features of the epic, portrayed in life by a professional painter \". What is known of this portrait is a copy, made at the request of the 3rd Duke of Laf\u00f5es, executed by Lu\u00eds Jos\u00e9 Pereira de Resende between 1819 and 1844, from the original that was found in a green silk bag in the rubble of the fire at the palace of the Counts of Ericeira, which has since disappeared. It is a \"very faithful copy\" that,\n\"due to the restricted dimensions of the drawing, the texture of the blood, creating spots of distribution of values, the rigor of the contours and the definition of the contrasted planes, the reticulated neutral that harmonizes the background and highlights the bust of the portrait, the type of the wrap around limits from which the enlightening signature runs down, in short, the symbolic apparatus of the image, captured in the pose of a graphic book illustration, was intended for the opening of an engraving on a copper plate, to illustrate one of the first editions of The Lusiads\"\nAlso survived a miniature painted in India in 1581, by order of Fern\u00e3o Teles de Meneses and offered to the viceroy D. Lu\u00eds de Ata\u00edde, who, according to testimonies of the time, was very similar to his appearance. Another portrait was found in the 1970s by Maria Antonieta de Azevedo, dated 1556 and showing the poet in prison. The first medal with its effigy appeared in 1782, ordered to mint by the Baron of Dillon in England, where Cam\u00f5es is crowned with laurels and dressed in coat of arms, with the inscription \"Apollo Portuguez / Honor de Hespanha / Nasceo 1524 / Morreo 1579\". In 1793, a reproduction of this medal was coined in Portugal, by order of Tom\u00e1s Jos\u00e9 de Aquino, Librarian of the Real Mesa Cens\u00f3ria.\nOver the centuries the image of Cam\u00f5es was represented numerous times in engraving, painting and sculpture, by Portuguese and foreign artists, and several monuments were erected in his honor, notably the great Monument to Cam\u00f5es installed in 1867 in Pra\u00e7a de Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es, in Lisbon, by Victor Bastos, which is the center of official public ceremonies and popular demonstrations. He was also honored in musical compositions, appeared with his effigy on medals, currency notes, stamps and coins, and as a character in novels, poetry and plays. The film Cam\u00f5es, directed by Jos\u00e9 Leit\u00e3o de Barros, was the first Portuguese film to participate in the Cannes Film Festival, in 1946. Among the famous artists who took him as a model for his works are Bordalo Pinheiro, Jos\u00e9 Sim\u00f5es de Almeida, Francisco Augusto Metrass, Ant\u00f3nio Soares dos Reis, Horace Vernet, Jos\u00e9 Malhoa, Vieira Portuense, Domingos Sequeira and Lagoa Henriques. A crater on the planet Mercury and an asteroid in the main belt were named after him.\nWork.\nContext.\nCam\u00f5es lived in the final phase of the European Renaissance, a period marked by many changes in culture and society, which mark the end of the Middle Ages and the beginning of the Modern Age and the transition from feudalism to capitalism. It was called \"renaissance\" due to the rediscovery and revaluation of the cultural references of Classical Antiquity, which guided the changes of this period towards a humanist and naturalist ideal that affirmed the dignity of man, placing him at the center of the universe, making him the researcher par excellence of nature, and privileging reason and science as arbitrators of manifest life. During this period, several scientific instruments were invented and several natural laws and physical entities previously unknown were discovered; the knowledge of the face of the planet itself changed after the discoveries of the great navigations. The spirit of intellectual speculation and scientific research was on the rise, causing Physics, Mathematics, Medicine, Astronomy, Philosophy, Engineering, Philology and several other branches of knowledge to reach a level of complexity, efficiency and accuracy unprecedented, which led to an optimistic conception of human history as a continuous expansion and always for the better. In a way, the Renaissance was an original and eclectic attempt to harmonize pagan Neoplatonism with the Christian religion, eros with charitas, together with oriental, Jewish and Arab influences, and where the study of magic, astrology and the occult was not absent. It was also the time when strong national states began to be created, commerce and cities expanded and the bourgeoisie became a force of great social and economic importance, contrasting with the relative decline in the influence of religion in world affairs.\nIn the 16th century, the time in which Cam\u00f5es lived, the influence of the Italian Renaissance expanded throughout Europe. However, several of its most typical features were declining, in particular because of a series of political disputes and wars that altered the European political map, with Italy losing its place as a power, and the split of Catholicism, with the emergence of the Protestant Reformation. In the Catholic reaction, Counter-Reformation was launched, the Inquisition was reactivated and ecclesiastical censorship was rekindled. At the same time, Machiavelli's doctrines became widespread, dissociating ethics from the practice of power. The result was the reaffirmation of the power of religion over the profane world and the formation of an agitated spiritual, political, social and intellectual atmosphere, with strong doses of pessimism, reverberating unfavorably on the former freedom that artists enjoyed. Despite this, the intellectual and artistic acquisitions of the High Renaissance that were still fresh and shining before the eyes could not be forgotten immediately, even if their philosophical substrate could no longer remain valid in the face of new political, religious and social facts. The new art that was made, although inspired by the source of classicism, translated it into restless, anxious, distorted, ambivalent forms, attached to intellectualist preciosities, characteristics that reflected the dilemmas of the century and define the general style of this phase as mannerist.\nSince the middle of the 15th century, Portugal had established itself as a great naval and commercial power, its arts were developing and enthusiasm for maritime conquests was boiling. The reign of D. Jo\u00e3o II was marked by the formation of a feeling of national pride, and in the time of D. Manuel I, as Spina &amp; Bechara say, pride had given way to delirium, to the pure euphoria of world domination. At the beginning of the 16th century, Garcia de Resende lamented that there was no one who could celebrate so many feats worthily, claiming that there was epic material superior to that of the Romans and Trojans. Filling this gap, Jo\u00e3o de Barros wrote his cavalry novel, \"A Cr\u00f3nica do Imperador Clarimundo\" (1520), in epic format. Shortly thereafter, Ant\u00f3nio Ferreira appeared, establishing himself as a mentor of the classicist generation and challenging his contemporaries to sing the glories of Portugal in high style. When Cam\u00f5es appeared, the land was prepared for the apotheosis of the homeland, a homeland that had fought hard to conquer its sovereignty, first of the Moors and after Castile, had developed an adventurous spirit that had taken it across the oceans, expanding the known borders of the world and opening new routes of trade and exploration, defeating enemy armies and the hostile forces of nature. But at this point, however, the political and cultural crisis was already being announced, materializing shortly after his death, when the country lost its sovereignty to Spain.\nOverview.\nCam\u00f5es' production is divided into three genres: lyrical, epic and theatrical. His lyrical work was immediately appreciated as a high achievement. He demonstrated his virtuosity especially in cantos and elegies, but his \"redondilhas\" are not far behind. In fact, he was a master in this form, giving new life to the art of gloss, instilling in it spontaneity and simplicity, a delicate irony and a lively phrasing, taking courtesan poetry to its highest level, and showing that he also knew how to express perfectly joy and relaxation. His epic production is synthesized in 'Os Lus\u00edadas', an intense glorification of Portuguese feats, not only of his military victories, but also the conquest over elements and physical space, with recurring use of classic allegories. The idea of a national epic has existed in the Portuguese heart since the 15th century, when the navigations started, but it was up to Cam\u00f5es, in the following century, to materialize it. In his dramatic works he sought to fuse nationalist and classic elements.\nProbably if he had remained in Portugal, as a courtly poet, he would never have achieved the mastery of his art. The experiences he accumulated as a soldier and navigator enriched his worldview and excited his talent. Through them, he managed to free himself from the formal limitations of courtesan poetry and the difficulties he went through, the profound anguish of exile, the longing for his country, indelibly impregnated his spirit and communicated with his work, and from there influenced in a marked way subsequent generations of Portuguese writers. His best poems shine exactly for what is genuine in the suffering expressed and the honesty of that expression, and this is one of the main reasons that put his poetry at such a high level.\nIts sources were numerous. He dominated Latin and Spanish, and demonstrated a solid knowledge of Greco-Roman mythology, ancient and modern European history, Portuguese chroniclers and classical literature, with authors such as Ovid, Xenophon, Lucan, Valerius Flaccus, Horace standing out, but especially Homer and Virgil, from whom he borrowed various structural and stylistic elements and sometimes even passages in almost literal transcription. According to his quotations, he also seems to have had a good knowledge of works by Ptolemy, Diogenes La\u00ebrtius, Pliny the Elder, Strabo and Pomponius Mela, among other historians and ancient scientists. Among the moderns, he was aware of the Italian production of Francesco Petrarca, Ludovico Ariosto, Torquato Tasso, Giovanni Boccaccio and Jacopo Sannazaro, and of Castilian literature.\nFor those who consider the Renaissance to be a homogeneous historical period, informed by classical ideals and extending to the end of the 16th century, Cam\u00f5es is quite simply a Renaissance, but in general it is recognized that the 16th century was largely dominated by a stylistic derivation called Mannerism, which at various points is an anti-classical school and in many ways prefigures the Baroque. Thus, for many authors, it is more appropriate to describe the Camonian style as mannerist, distinguishing it from typical Renaissance classicism. This is justified by the presence of several language resources and an approach to its themes that are not in agreement with the doctrines of balance, economy, tranquility, harmony, unity and invariable idealism, which are the fundamental axes of Renaissance classicism. Cam\u00f5es, after a typically classic initial phase, moved on to other paths and anxiety and drama became his companions. Throughout The Lusiads the signs of a political and spiritual crisis are visible, the prospect of the decline of the empire and the character of the Portuguese remains in the air, censored by bad customs and the lack of appreciation for the arts, alternating with excerpts in which its enthusiastic apology. They are also typical of Mannerism, and would become even more Baroque, the taste for contrast, for emotional flare, for conflict, for paradox, for religious propaganda, for the use of complex figures of speech and preciousness, even for the grotesque and monstrous, many of them common features in Camonian work.\nThe mannerist nature of his work is also marked by the ambiguities generated by the rupture with the past and by the concomitant adherence to it, the first manifested in the visualization of a new era and in the use of new poetic formulas from Italy, and the second, in the use of archaisms typical of the Middle Ages. Along with the use of formal Renaissance and classicist models, he cultivated the medieval genres of vilancete, cantiga and trova. For Joaquim dos Santos, the contradictory character of his poetry is found in the contrast between two opposing premises: idealism and practical experience. He combined typical values of humanist rationalism with other derivatives of cavalry, crusades and feudalism, aligned the constant propaganda of the Catholic faith with ancient mythology, responsible in the aesthetic plan for all the action that materializes the final realization, discarding the mediocre aurea dear to classics to advocate the primacy of the exercise of weapons and the glorious conquest.\nOs Lus\u00edadas.\nOs Lus\u00edadas, or The Lusiads is considered the Portuguese epic par excellence. The title itself already suggests its nationalist intentions, being derived from the ancient Roman denomination of Portugal, Lusitania. It is one of the most important epics of the modern age due to its greatness and universality. The epic tells the story of Vasco da Gama and the Portuguese heroes who sailed around the Cape of Good Hope and opened a new route to India. It is a humanist epic, even in its contradictions, in the association of pagan mythology with the Christian view, in the opposite feelings about war and empire, in the taste of rest and in the desire for adventure, in the appreciation of sensual pleasure and in the demands of an ethical life, in the perception of greatness and in the presentiment of decline, in the heroism paid for with suffering and struggle. The poem opens with the famous verses:\nThe ten cantos of the poem add up to 1,102 stanzas in a total of 8,816 decyllable verses, using the ottava rima (abababcc). After an introduction, an invocation and a dedication to King Sebastian, the action begins, which merges myths and historical facts. Vasco da Gama, sailing along the coast of Africa, is observed by the assembly of classical gods, who discuss the fate of the expedition, which is protected by Venus and attacked by Bacchus. Resting for a few days in Malindi, at the request of the local king Vasco da Gama narrates all Portuguese history, from its origins to the journey they undertake. The cantos III, IV and V contain some of the best passages of the entire epic: the episode of In\u00eas de Castro, which becomes a symbol of love and death, the Battle of Aljubarrota, the vision of D. Manuel I, the description of St. Elmo's fire, the story of the giant Adamastor. Back on the ship, the poet takes advantage of his free time to tell the story of the Twelve of England, while Bacchus summons the sea gods to destroy the Portuguese fleet. Venus intervenes and ships reach Calicut, India. There, Paulo da Gama receives the king's representatives and explains the meaning of the banners that adorn the flagship. On the return trip the sailors enjoy the island created for them by Venus, rewarding the nymphs with their favors. One of them sings the glorious future of Portugal and the scene ends with a description of the universe by Tethys and Vasco da Gama. Then the journey continues home.\nIn Os Lus\u00edadas, Cam\u00f5es achieves a remarkable harmony between classical scholarship and practical experience, developed with consummate technical skill, describing Portuguese adventures with moments of serious thought mixed with others of delicate sensitivity and humanism. The great descriptions of the battles, the manifestation of the natural forces, the sensual encounters, transcend the allegory and the classicist allusion that permeate all the work and present themselves as a fluent speech and always of a high aesthetic level, not only for its narrative character especially well achieved, but also by the superior mastery of all the resources of the language and the art of versification, with a knowledge of a wide range of styles, used in efficient combination. The work is also a serious warning for Christian kings to abandon small rivalries and unite against Muslim expansion.\nThe structure of the work is in itself worthy of interest, as, according to Jorge de Sena, nothing is arbitrary in Os Lus\u00edadas. Among the arguments he presented was the use of the golden section, a defined relationship between the parts and the whole, organizing the set in ideal proportions that emphasize especially significant passages. Sena demonstrated that when applying the golden section to the whole work, it falls precisely on the verse that describes the arrival of the Portuguese in India. Applying the separate section to the two resulting parts, in the first part comes the episode that reports the death of In\u00eas de Castro and, in the second, the stanza that narrates Cupid's efforts to unite the Portuguese and the nymphs, which for Sena reinforces the importance of love throughout the composition. Two other elements give Os Lus\u00edadas its modernity and distance it from classicism: the introduction of doubt, contradiction and questioning, in disagreement with the affirmative certainty that characterizes the classic epic, and the primacy of rhetoric over action, replacing the world of facts with that of words, which do not fully recover reality and evolve into metalanguage, with the same disruptive effect on the traditional epic.\nAccording to Costa Pimp\u00e3o, there is no evidence that Cam\u00f5es intended to write his epic before he traveled to India, although heroic themes were already present in his previous production. It is possible that he drew some inspiration from fragments of the \"Decades of Asia\", by Jo\u00e3o de Barros, and the \"History of the Discovery and Conquest of India by the Portuguese\", by Fern\u00e3o Lopes de Castanheda. On classical mythology he was certainly well informed before that, as well as on ancient epic literature. Apparently, the poem started to take shape as early as 1554. Storck considers that the determination to write it was born during the sea voyage itself. Between 1568 and 1569 he was seen in Mozambique by the historian Diogo do Couto, his friend, still working on the work, which only came to light in Lisbon, in 1572.\nThe success of the publication of Os Lus\u00edadas supposedly required a second edition in the same year as the \"princeps\" edition. The two differ in countless details and it was debated at length which one would in fact be the original. Nor is it clear to whom the amendments to the second text are due. Currently, the edition that shows the publisher's brand, a pelican, with its neck turned to the left, which is called edition A, carried out under the supervision of the author, is recognized as original. However, edition B was for a long time taken as \"princeps\", with disastrous consequences for the later critical analysis of the work. Apparently edition B was produced later, around 1584 or 1585, in a clandestine manner, taking the fictitious date of 1572 to bypass the delays of censorship of the time, if it were published as a new edition, and to correct the serious defects of another 1584 edition, the so-called \"piscos\" edition. However, Maria Helena Paiva raised the hypothesis that editions A and B are only variants of the same edition, which was corrected after the typographic composition, but while printing was already in progress. According to the researcher, \"the need to make the most of the press led to the conclusion that, after printing a shape, which consisted of several folios, a first test was taken, which was corrected while the press continued, now with the corrected text. There were, therefore, uncorrected printed folios and corrected printed folios, which were grouped indistinctly in the same copy\", so that there were no two copies exactly the same in the press system of that time.\n\"Rimas\".\nCam\u00f5es' lyric work, dispersed in manuscripts, was collected and published posthumously in 1595 under the title \"Rimas\" (\"Rhymes\"). Throughout the 17th century, the growing prestige of his epic contributed to raise the appreciation for these other poems even more. The collection includes \"redondilhas\", odes, glosses, cantigas, twists or variations, \"sextilhas\", sonnets, elegies, eclogues and other small stanzas. His lyrical poetry comes from several different sources: the sonnets generally follow the Italian style derived from Petrarch, the songs took the model of Petrarch and Pietro Bembo. In the odes, the influence of the troubadour poetry of chivalry and classical poetry is verified, but with a more refined style; in the \"sextilhas\" the Proven\u00e7al influence is clear; in the redondilhas it expanded the form, deepened the lyricism and introduced a theme, worked on antitheses and paradoxes, unknown in the old tradition of Cantigas de amigo, and the elegies are quite classicist. Its resorts follow an epistolary style, with moralizing themes. Eclogues are perfect pieces of the pastoral genre, derived from Virgil and the Italians. The influence of Spanish poetry by Garcilaso de la Vega, Jorge de Montemor, Juan Bosc\u00e1n, Gregorio Silvestre and several other names was also detected in many points of his lyric, as his commentator Faria e Sousa pointed out.\nDespite the care of the first editor of \"Rimas\", Fern\u00e3o Rodrigues Lobo Soropita, in the 1595 edition, several apocryphal poems were included. Many poems were discovered over the next few centuries and attributed to him, but not always with careful critical analysis. The result was that, for example, while in the original Rhymes there were 65 sonnets, in the 1861 edition of Juromenha there were 352; in the 1953 edition of Aguiar e Silva 166 pieces were still listed. In addition, many editions modernized or \"embellished\" the original text, a practice that was particularly pronounced after the 1685 edition of Faria e Sousa, giving rise to and rooting a tradition of its own in this adulterated lesson that caused enormous difficulties for critical study. More scientific studies only began to be undertaken at the end of the 19th century, with the contribution of Wilhelm Storck and Carolina Micha\u00eblis de Vasconcelos, who discarded several apocryphal compositions. At the beginning of the 20th century, work continued with Jos\u00e9 Maria Rodrigues and Afonso Lopes Vieira, who published Rimas in 1932 in an edition they called \"cr\u00edtica\" (\"criticism\"), although it did not deserve the name: it adopted large parts of Faria and Sousa's lesson, but editors claimed to have used the original editions, from 1595 and 1598. On the other hand, they definitely raised the issue of textual fraud that had been perpetuating for a long time and had tampered with the poems to the point of becoming unrecognizable. One example is enough:\nIt seems impossible to reach a definitive result in this purge. However, enough authentic material survives to guarantee his position as the best Portuguese lyricist and the greatest Renaissance poet in Portugal.\nComedies.\nThe general content of his works for the stage combines, in the same way as in Os Lus\u00edadas, nationalism and classic inspiration. His production in this field is limited to three works, all in the genre of comedy and in the format of self: \"El-Rei Seleuco\", \"Filodemo\" and \"Anfitri\u00f5es\". The attribution of \"El-Rei Seleuco\" to Cam\u00f5es, however, is controversial. Its existence was not known until 1654, when it appeared published in the first part of Rimas in the Craesbeeck edition, which gave no details about its origin and had little care in editing the text. The play also differs in several aspects from the other two that survived, such as its much shorter length (an act), the existence of a prologue in prose, and the less profound and less erudite treatment of the love theme. The theme, of the complicated passion of Antiochus, son of King Seleucus I Nicator, for his stepmother, Queen Estratonice, was taken from a historical fact from Antiquity transmitted by Plutarch and repeated by Petrarch and the Spanish popular songwriter, working it in the style by Gil Vicente.\n\"Anfitri\u00f5es\", published in 1587, is an adaptation of Plautus' Amphitryon, where it emphasizes the comic character of the Amphitryon myth, highlighting the omnipotence of love, which subdues even the immortals, also following the Vincentian tradition. The play was written in smaller \"redondilhas\" and uses bilingualism, using Castilian in the lines of the character S\u00f3sia, a slave, to mark his low social level in passages that reach the grotesque, a feature that appears in the other pieces as well. \"Filodemo\", composed in India and dedicated to the viceroy D. Francisco Barreto, is a comedy of morality in five acts, according to the classical division, being, of the three, the one that remained most alive in the interest of the critic due to the multiplicity of human experiences it describes and for the sharpness of psychological observation. The theme is about the love of a servant, Filodemo, for the daughter, Dionisa, of the nobleman in the house of the one he serves, with autobiographical traits. Cam\u00f5es saw comedy as a secondary genre, of interest only as a diversion of circumstance, but he achieved significant results by transferring the comicality of the characters to the action and refining the plot, so he pointed out a path for the renewal of Portuguese comedy. However, his suggestion was not followed by the growers of the genus who succeeded him.\nBibliography.\nWorks by Cam\u00f5es"}
{"title": "Percy_Bysshe_Shelley", "label": "Writer", "text": "Percy Bysshe Shelley ( ; 4 August 17928 July 1822) was one of the major English Romantic poets. A radical in his poetry as well as in his political and social views, Shelley did not achieve fame during his lifetime, but recognition of his achievements in poetry grew steadily following his death and he became an important influence on subsequent generations of poets including Robert Browning, Algernon Charles Swinburne, Thomas Hardy, and W. B. Yeats. American literary critic Harold Bloom describes him as \"a superb craftsman, a lyric poet without rival, and surely one of the most advanced sceptical intellects ever to write a poem.\" \nShelley's critical reputation fluctuated during the 20th century, but in recent decades he has achieved increasing critical acclaim for the sweeping momentum of his poetic imagery, his mastery of genres and verse forms, and the complex interplay of sceptical, idealist, and materialist ideas in his work. Among his best-known works are \"Ozymandias\" (1818), \"Ode to the West Wind\" (1819), \"To a Skylark\" (1820), and the political ballad \"The Mask of Anarchy\" (1819). His other major works include the verse drama \"The Cenci\" (1819) and long poems such as \"Alastor, or The Spirit of Solitude\" (1815), \"Julian and Maddalo\" (1819), \"Adonais\" (1821), \"Prometheus Unbound\" (1820)\u2014widely considered his masterpiece\u2014\"Hellas\" (1822), and his final, unfinished work, \"The Triumph of Life\" (1822).\nShelley also wrote prose fiction and a quantity of essays on political, social, and philosophical issues. Much of this poetry and prose was not published in his lifetime, or only published in expurgated form, due to the risk of prosecution for political and religious libel. From the 1820s, his poems and political and ethical writings became popular in Owenist, Chartist, and radical political circles and later drew admirers as diverse as Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, and George Bernard Shaw.\nShelley's life was marked by family crises, ill health, and a backlash against his atheism, political views and defiance of social conventions. He went into permanent self-exile in Italy in 1818, and over the next four years produced what Leader and O'Neill call \"some of the finest poetry of the Romantic period\". His second wife, Mary Shelley, was the author of \"Frankenstein\". He died in a boating accident in 1822 at the age of 29.\nLife.\nEarly life and education.\nShelley was born on 4 August 1792 at Field Place, Warnham, on the edge of Broadbridge Heath, near Horsham, West Sussex, England. He was the eldest son of Sir Timothy Shelley (1753\u20131844), a Whig Member of Parliament for Horsham from 1790 to 1792 and for Shoreham between 1806 and 1812, and his wife, Elizabeth Pilfold (1763\u20131846), the daughter of a successful butcher. He had four younger sisters and one much younger brother. Shelley's early childhood was sheltered and mostly happy. He was particularly close to his sisters and his mother, who encouraged him to hunt, fish and ride. At age six, he was sent to a day school run by the vicar of Warnham church, where he displayed an impressive memory and gift for languages.\nIn 1802 he entered the Syon House Academy of Brentford, Middlesex, where his cousin Thomas Medwin was a pupil. Shelley was bullied and unhappy at the school and sometimes responded with violent rage. He also began suffering from the nightmares, hallucinations and sleep walking that were to periodically afflict him throughout his life. Shelley developed an interest in science which supplemented his voracious reading of tales of mystery, romance and the supernatural. During his holidays at Field Place, his sisters were often terrified at being subjected to his experiments with gunpowder, acids and electricity. Back at school he blew up a paling fence with gunpowder.\nIn 1804, Shelley entered Eton College, a period which he later recalled with loathing. He was subjected to particularly severe mob bullying which the perpetrators called \"Shelley-baits\". A number of biographers and contemporaries have attributed the bullying to Shelley's aloofness, nonconformity and refusal to take part in fagging. His peculiarities and violent rages earned him the nickname \"Mad Shelley\". His interest in the occult and science continued, and contemporaries describe him giving an electric shock to a master, blowing up a tree stump with gunpowder and attempting to raise spirits with occult rituals. In his senior years, Shelley came under the influence of a part-time teacher, Dr James Lind, who encouraged his interest in the occult and introduced him to liberal and radical authors. Shelley also developed an interest in Plato and idealist philosophy which he pursued in later years through self-study. According to Richard Holmes, Shelley, by his leaving year, had gained a reputation as a classical scholar and a tolerated eccentric. \nIn his last term at Eton, his first novel \"Zastrozzi\" appeared and he had established a following among his fellow students. Prior to enrolling for University College, Oxford in October 1810, Shelley completed \"Original Poetry by Victor and Cazire\" (written with his sister Elizabeth), the verse melodrama \"The Wandering Jew\" and the gothic novel \"St. Irvine; or, The Rosicrucian: A Romance\" (published 1811).\nAt Oxford Shelley attended few lectures, instead spending long hours reading and conducting scientific experiments in the laboratory he set up in his room. He met a fellow student, Thomas Jefferson Hogg, who became his closest friend. Shelley became increasingly politicised under Hogg's influence, developing strong radical and anti-Christian views. Such views were dangerous in the reactionary political climate prevailing during Britain's war with Napoleonic France, and Shelley's father warned him against Hogg's influence.\nIn the winter of 1810\u20131811, Shelley published a series of anonymous political poems and tracts: \"Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson\", \"The Necessity of Atheism\" (written in collaboration with Hogg) and \"A Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things\". Shelley mailed \"The Necessity of Atheism\" to all the bishops and heads of colleges at Oxford, and he was called to appear before the college's fellows, including the Dean, George Rowley. His refusal to college authorities to answer questions regarding whether or not he authored the pamphlet resulted in his expulsion from Oxford on 25March 1811, along with Hogg. Hearing of his son's expulsion, Shelley's father threatened to cut all contact with Shelley unless he agreed to return home and study under tutors appointed by him. Shelley's refusal to do so led to a falling-out with his father.\nMarriage to Harriet Westbrook.\nIn late December 1810, Shelley had met Harriet Westbrook, a pupil at the same boarding school as Shelley's sisters. They corresponded frequently that winter and also after Shelley had been expelled from Oxford. Shelley expounded his radical ideas on politics, religion and marriage to Harriet, and they gradually convinced each other that she was oppressed by her father and at school. Shelley's infatuation with Harriet developed in the months following his expulsion, when he was under severe emotional strain due to the conflict with his family, his bitterness over the breakdown of his romance with his cousin Harriet Grove, and his unfounded belief that he might be suffering from a fatal illness. At the same time, Harriet Westbrook's elder sister Eliza, to whom Harriet was very close, encouraged the young girl's romance with Shelley. Shelley's correspondence with Harriet intensified in July, while he was holidaying in Wales, and in response to her urgent pleas for his protection, he returned to London in early August. Putting aside his philosophical objections to matrimony, he left with the sixteen-year-old Harriet for Edinburgh on 25 August 1811, and they were married there on the 28th.\nHearing of the elopement, Harriet's father, John Westbrook, and Shelley's father, Timothy, cut off the allowances of the bride and groom. (Shelley's father believed his son had married beneath him, as Harriet's father had earned his fortune in trade and was the owner of a tavern and coffee house.)\nSurviving on borrowed money, Shelley and Harriet stayed in Edinburgh for a month, with Hogg living under the same roof. The trio left for York in October, and Shelley went on to Sussex to settle matters with his father, leaving Harriet behind with Hogg. Shelley returned from his unsuccessful excursion to find that Eliza had moved in with Harriet and Hogg. Harriet confessed that Hogg had tried to seduce her while Shelley had been away. Shelley, Harriet and Eliza soon left for Keswick in the Lake District, leaving Hogg in York.\nAt this time Shelley was also involved in an intense platonic relationship with Elizabeth Hitchener, a 28-year-old unmarried schoolteacher of advanced views, with whom he had been corresponding. Hitchener, whom Shelley called the \"sister of my soul\" and \"my second self\", became his confidante and intellectual companion as he developed his views on politics, religion, ethics and personal relationships. Shelley proposed that she join him, Harriet and Eliza in a communal household where all property would be shared.\nThe Shelleys and Eliza spent December and January in Keswick where Shelley visited Robert Southey whose poetry he admired. Southey was taken with Shelley, even though there was a wide gulf between them politically, and predicted great things for him as a poet. Southey also informed Shelley that William Godwin, author of \"Political Justice\", which had greatly influenced him in his youth, and which Shelley also admired, was still alive. Shelley wrote to Godwin, offering himself as his devoted disciple. Godwin, who had modified many of his earlier radical views, advised Shelley to reconcile with his father, become a scholar before he published anything else, and give up his avowed plans for political agitation in Ireland.\nMeanwhile, Shelley had met his father's patron, Charles Howard, 11th Duke of Norfolk, who helped secure the reinstatement of Shelley's allowance. With Harriet's allowance also restored, Shelley now had the funds for his Irish venture. Their departure for Ireland was precipitated by increasing hostility towards the Shelley household from their landlord and neighbours who were alarmed by Shelley's scientific experiments, pistol shooting and radical political views. As tension mounted, Shelley claimed he had been attacked in his home by ruffians, an event which might have been real or a delusional episode triggered by stress. This was the first of a series of episodes in subsequent years where Shelley claimed to have been attacked by strangers during periods of personal crisis.\nEarly in 1812, Shelley wrote, published and personally distributed in Dublin three political tracts: \"An Address, to the Irish People; Proposals for an Association of Philanthropists;\" and \"Declaration of Rights\". He also delivered a speech at a meeting of O'Connell's Catholic Committee in which he called for Catholic emancipation, repeal of the Act of Union and an end to the oppression of the Irish poor. Reports of Shelley's subversive activities were sent to the Home Secretary.\nReturning from Ireland, the Shelley household travelled to Wales, then Devon, where they again came under government surveillance for distributing subversive literature. Elizabeth Hitchener joined the household in Devon, but several months later had a falling out with the Shelleys and left.\nThe Shelley household had settled in Tremadoc, Wales in September 1812, where Shelley worked on \"Queen Mab\", a utopian allegory with extensive notes preaching atheism, free love, republicanism and vegetarianism. The poem was published the following year in a private edition of 250 copies, although few were initially distributed because of the risk of prosecution for seditious and religious libel.\nIn February 1813, Shelley claimed he was attacked in his home at night. The incident might have been real, a hallucination brought on by stress, or a hoax staged by Shelley in order to escape government surveillance, creditors and his entanglements in local politics. The Shelleys and Eliza fled to Ireland, then London.\nBack in England, Shelley's debts mounted as he tried unsuccessfully to reach a financial settlement with his father. On 23 June Harriet gave birth to a girl, Eliza Ianthe Shelley, and in the following months the relationship between Shelley and his wife deteriorated. Shelley resented the influence Harriet's sister had over her, while Harriet was alienated by Shelley's close friendship with an attractive widow, Harriet Boinville, and her daughter Cornelia Turner. Following Ianthe's birth, the Shelleys moved frequently across London, Wales, the Lake District, Scotland and Berkshire to escape creditors and search for a home.\nIn March 1814, Shelley remarried Harriet in London to settle any doubts about the legality of their Edinburgh wedding and secure the rights of their child. Nevertheless, the Shelleys lived apart for most of the following months, and Shelley reflected bitterly on: \"my rash &amp; heartless union with Harriet\".\nElopement with Mary Godwin.\nIn May, Shelley began visiting his mentor Godwin almost daily, and soon fell in love with Mary, the sixteen-year-old daughter of Godwin and the late feminist author Mary Wollstonecraft. Shelley and Mary declared their love for each other during a visit to her mother's grave in the churchyard of St Pancras Old Church on 26 June. When Shelley told Godwin that he intended to leave Harriet and live with Mary, his mentor banished him from the house and forbade Mary from seeing him. Shelley and Mary eloped to Europe on 28 July, taking Mary's step-sister Claire Clairmont with them. Before leaving, Shelley had secured a loan of \u00a33,000 but had left most of the funds at the disposal of Godwin and Harriet, who was now pregnant. The financial arrangement with Godwin led to rumours that he had sold his daughters to Shelley.\nShelley, Mary and Claire made their way across war-ravaged France where Shelley wrote to Harriet, asking her to meet them in Switzerland with the money he had left for her. Hearing nothing from Harriet in Switzerland, and unable to secure sufficient funds or suitable accommodation, the three travelled to Germany and Holland before returning to England on 13 September.\nShelley spent the next few months trying to raise loans and avoid bailiffs. Mary was pregnant, lonely, depressed and ill. Her mood was not improved when she heard that on 30 November Harriet had given birth to Charles Bysshe Shelley, heir to the Shelley fortune and baronetcy. This was followed in early January by news that Shelley's grandfather, Sir Bysshe, had died leaving an estate worth \u00a3220,000. However, the settlement of the estate, and a financial settlement between Shelley and his father (now Sir Timothy), wasn't concluded until April the following year. \nIn February 1815, Mary gave premature birth to a baby girl who died ten days later, deepening her depression. In the following weeks, Mary became close to Hogg who temporarily moved into the household. Shelley was almost certainly having a sexual relationship with Claire at this time, and it is possible that Mary, with Shelley's encouragement, was also having a sexual relationship with Hogg. In May, Claire left the household at Mary's insistence, to reside in Lynmouth.\nIn August Shelley and Mary moved to Bishopsgate where Shelley worked on \"Alastor\", a long poem in blank verse based on the myth of Narcissus and Echo. \"Alastor\" was published in an edition of 250 in early 1816 to poor sales and largely unfavourable reviews from the conservative press.\nOn 24 January 1816, Mary gave birth to William Shelley. Shelley was delighted to have another son, but was suffering from the strain of prolonged financial negotiations with his father, Harriet and William Godwin. Shelley showed signs of delusional behaviour and was contemplating an escape to the continent.\nByron.\nClaire initiated a sexual relationship with Lord Byron in April, just before his self-exile on the continent, and then arranged for Byron to meet Shelley, Mary and her in Geneva. Shelley admired Byron's poetry and had sent him \"Queen Mab\" and other poems. Shelley's party arrived in Geneva in May and rented a house close to Villa Diodati, on the shores of Lake Geneva, where Byron was staying. There Shelley, Byron and the others engaged in discussions about literature, science and \"various philosophical doctrines\". One night, while Byron was reciting Coleridge's \"Christabel\", Shelley suffered a severe panic attack with hallucinations. The previous night Mary had had a more productive vision or nightmare which inspired her novel \"Frankenstein\".\nShelley and Byron then took a boating tour around Lake Geneva, which inspired Shelley to write his \"Hymn to Intellectual Beauty\", his first substantial poem since \"Alastor\". A tour of Chamonix in the French Alps inspired \"Mont Blanc\", which has been described as an atheistic response to Coleridge's \"Hymn before Sunrise in the Vale of Chamoni\". During this tour, Shelley often signed guest books with a declaration that he was an atheist. These declarations were seen by other British tourists, including Southey, which hardened attitudes against Shelley back home.\nRelations between Byron and Shelley's party became strained when Byron was told that Claire was pregnant with his child. Shelley, Mary, and Claire left Switzerland in late August, with arrangements for the expected baby still unclear, although Shelley made provision for Claire and the baby in his will. In January 1817 Claire gave birth to a daughter by Byron who she named Alba, but later renamed Allegra in accordance with Byron's wishes.\nMarriage to Mary Godwin.\nShelley and Mary returned to England in September 1816, and in early October they heard that Mary's half-sister Fanny Imlay had killed herself. Godwin believed that Fanny had been in love with Shelley, and Shelley himself suffered depression and guilt over her death, writing: \"Friend had I known thy secret grief / Should we had parted so.\" Further tragedy followed in December when Shelley's estranged wife Harriet drowned herself in the Serpentine. Harriet, pregnant and living alone at the time, believed that she had been abandoned by her new lover. In her suicide letter she asked Shelley to take custody of their son Charles but to leave their daughter in her sister Eliza's care.\nShelley married Mary Godwin on 30 December, despite his philosophical objections to the institution. The marriage was intended to help secure Shelley's custody of his children by Harriet and to placate Godwin who had refused to see Shelley and Mary because of their previous adulterous relationship. After a prolonged legal battle, the Court of Chancery eventually awarded custody of Shelley and Harriet's children to foster parents, on the grounds that Shelley had abandoned his first wife for Mary without cause and was an atheist.\nIn March 1817 the Shelleys moved to the village of Marlow, Buckinghamshire, where Shelley's friend Thomas Love Peacock lived. The Shelley household included Claire and her baby Allegra, both of whose presence was resented by Mary. Shelley's generosity with money and increasing debts also led to financial and marital stress, as did Godwin's frequent requests for financial help.\nOn 2 September Mary gave birth to a daughter, Clara Everina Shelley. Soon after, Shelley left for London with Claire, which increased Mary's resentment towards her step-sister. Shelley was arrested for two days in London over money he owed, and attorneys visited Mary in Marlowe over Shelley's debts.\nShelley took part in the literary and political circle that surrounded Leigh Hunt, and during this period he met William Hazlitt and John Keats. Shelley's major work during this time was \"Laon and Cythna\", a long narrative poem featuring incest and attacks on religion. It was hastily withdrawn after publication due to fears of prosecution for religious libel, and was re-edited and reissued as \"The Revolt of Islam\" in January 1818. Shelley also published two political tracts under a pseudonym: \"A Proposal for putting Reform to the Vote throughout the Kingdom\" (March 1817) and \"An Address to the People on the Death of Princess Charlotte\" (November 1817). In December he wrote \"Ozymandias\", which is considered to be one of his finest sonnets, as part of a competition with friend and fellow poet Horace Smith.\nItaly.\nOn 12 March 1818 the Shelleys and Claire left England to escape its \"tyranny civil and religious\". A doctor had also recommended that Shelley go to Italy for his chronic lung complaint, and Shelley had arranged to take Claire's daughter, Allegra, to her father Byron who was now in Venice.\nAfter travelling some months through France and Italy, Shelley left Mary and baby Clara at Bagni di Lucca (in today's Tuscany) while he travelled with Claire to Venice to see Byron and make arrangements for visiting Allegra. Byron invited the Shelleys to stay at his summer residence at Este, and Shelley urged Mary to meet him there. Clara became seriously ill on the journey and died on 24 September in Venice. Following Clara's death, Mary fell into a long period of depression and emotional estrangement from Shelley.\nThe Shelleys moved to Naples on 1 December, where they stayed for three months. During this period Shelley was ill, depressed and almost suicidal: a state of mind reflected in his poem \"Stanzas written in Dejection \u2013 December 1818, Near Naples\".\nWhile in Naples, Shelley registered the birth and baptism of a baby girl, Elena Adelaide Shelley (born 27 December), naming himself as the father and falsely naming Mary as the mother. The parentage of Elena has never been conclusively established. Biographers have variously speculated that she was adopted by Shelley to console Mary for the loss of Clara, that she was Shelley's child to Claire, that she was his child to his servant Elise Foggi, or that she was the child of a \"mysterious lady\" who had followed Shelley to the continent. Shelley registered the birth and baptism on 27 February 1819, and the household left Naples for Rome the following day, leaving Elena with carers. Elena was to die in a poor suburb of Naples on 9 June 1820.\nIn Rome, Shelley was in poor health, probably suffering from nephritis and tuberculosis which later was in remission. Nevertheless, he made significant progress on three major works: \"Julian and Maddalo\", \"Prometheus Unbound\" and \"The Cenci\". \"Julian and Maddalo\" is an autobiographical poem which explores the relationship between Shelley and Byron and analyses Shelley's personal crises of 1818 and 1819. The poem was completed in the summer of 1819, but was not published in Shelley's lifetime. \"Prometheus Unbound\" is a long dramatic poem inspired by Aeschylus's retelling of the Prometheus myth. It was completed in late 1819 and published in 1820. \"The Cenci\" is a verse drama of rape, murder and incest based on the story of the Renaissance Count Cenci of Rome and his daughter Beatrice. Shelley completed the play in September and the first edition was published that year. It was to become one of his most popular works and the only one to have two authorised editions in his lifetime.\nShelley's three-year-old son William died in June, probably of malaria. The new tragedy caused a further decline in Shelley's health and deepened Mary's depression. On 4 August she wrote: \"We have now lived five years together; and if all the events of the five years were blotted out, I might be happy\".The Shelleys were now living in Livorno where, in September, Shelley heard of the Peterloo Massacre of peaceful protesters in Manchester. Within two weeks he had completed one of his most famous political poems, \"The Mask of Anarchy\", and despatched it to Leigh Hunt for publication. Hunt, however, decided not to publish it for fear of prosecution for seditious libel. The poem was only officially published in 1832.\nThe Shelleys moved to Florence in October, where Shelley read a scathing review of the \"Revolt of Islam\" (and its earlier version \"Laon and Cythna\") in the conservative \"Quarterly Review\". Shelley was angered by the personal attack on him in the article which he erroneously believed had been written by Southey. His bitterness over the review lasted for the rest of his life.\nOn 12 November, Mary gave birth to a boy, Percy Florence Shelley. Around the time of Percy's birth, the Shelleys met Sophia Stacey, who was a ward of one of Shelley's uncles and was staying at the same pension as the Shelleys. Sophia, a talented harpist and singer, formed a friendship with Shelley while Mary was preoccupied with her newborn son. Shelley wrote at least five love poems and fragments for Sophia including \"Song written for an Indian Air\".\nThe Shelleys moved to Pisa in January 1820, ostensibly to consult a doctor who had been recommended to them. There they became friends with the Irish republican Margaret Mason (Lady Margaret Mountcashell) and her common-law husband George William Tighe. Mrs Mason became the inspiration for Shelley's poem \"The Sensitive Plant\", and Shelley's discussions with Mason and Tighe influenced his political thought and his critical interest in the population theories of Thomas Malthus.\nIn March Shelley wrote to friends that Mary was depressed, suicidal and hostile towards him. Shelley was also beset by financial worries, as creditors from England pressed him for payment and he was obliged to make secret payments in connection with his \"Neapolitan charge\" Elena.\nMeanwhile, Shelley was writing \"A Philosophical View of Reform\", a political essay which he had begun in Rome. The unfinished essay, which remained unpublished in Shelley's lifetime, has been called \"one of the most advanced and sophisticated documents of political philosophy in the nineteenth century\".\nAnother crisis erupted in June when Shelley claimed that he had been assaulted in the Pisan post office by a man accusing him of foul crimes. Shelley's biographer James Bieri suggests that this incident was possibly a delusional episode brought on by extreme stress, as Shelley was being blackmailed by a former servant, Paolo Foggi, over baby Elena. It is likely that the blackmail was connected with a story spread by another former servant, Elise Foggi, that Shelley had fathered a child to Claire in Naples and had sent it to a foundling home. Shelley, Claire and Mary denied this story, and Elise later recanted.\nIn July, hearing that John Keats was seriously ill in England, Shelley wrote to the poet inviting him to stay with him at Pisa. Keats replied with hopes of seeing him, but instead, arrangements were made for Keats to travel to Rome. Following the death of Keats in 1821, Shelley wrote \"Adonais\", which Harold Bloom considers one of the major pastoral elegies. The poem was published in Pisa in July 1821, but sold few copies.\nIn early July 1820, Shelley heard that baby Elena had died on 9 June. In the months following the post office incident and Elena's death, relations between Mary and Claire deteriorated and Claire spent most of the next two years living separately from the Shelleys, mainly in Florence.\nThat December Shelley met Teresa (Emilia) Viviani, who was the 19-year-old daughter of the Governor of Pisa and was living in a convent awaiting a suitable marriage. Shelley visited her several times over the next few months and they started a passionate correspondence which dwindled after her marriage the following September. Emilia was the inspiration for Shelley's major poem \"Epipsychidion\".\nIn March 1821 Shelley completed \"A Defence of Poetry\", a response to Peacock's article \"The Four Ages of Poetry\". Shelley's essay, with its famous conclusion \"Poets are the unacknowledged legislators of the world\", remained unpublished in his lifetime.\nShelley went alone to Ravenna in early August to see Byron, making a detour to Livorno for a rendezvous with Claire. Shelley stayed with Byron for two weeks and invited the older poet to spend the winter in Pisa. After Shelley heard Byron read his newly completed fifth canto of \"Don Juan\" he wrote to Mary: \"I despair of rivalling Byron.\"\nIn November Byron moved into Villa Lanfranchi in Pisa, just across the river from the Shelleys. Byron became the centre of the \"Pisan circle\" which was to include Shelley, Thomas Medwin, Edward Williams and Edward Trelawny.\nIn the early months of 1822 Shelley became increasingly close to Jane Williams, who was living with her partner Edward Williams in the same building as the Shelleys. Shelley wrote a number of love poems for Jane, including \"The Serpent is shut out of Paradise\" and \"With a Guitar, to Jane\". Shelley's obvious affection for Jane was to cause increasing tension between Shelley, Edward Williams and Mary.\nClaire arrived in Pisa in April at Shelley's invitation, and soon after they heard that her daughter Allegra had died of typhus in Ravenna. The Shelleys and Claire then moved to Villa Magni, near Lerici on the shores of the Gulf of La Spezia. Shelley acted as mediator between Claire and Byron over arrangements for the burial of their daughter, and the added strain led to Shelley having a series of hallucinations.\nMary almost died from a miscarriage on 16 June, her life only being saved by Shelley's effective first aid. Two days later Shelley wrote to a friend that there was no sympathy between Mary and him and if the past and future could be obliterated he would be content in his boat with Jane and her guitar. That same day he also wrote to Trelawny asking for prussic acid. The following week, Shelley woke the household with his screaming over a nightmare or hallucination in which he saw Edward and Jane Williams as walking corpses and himself strangling Mary.\nDuring this time, Shelley was writing his final major poem, the unfinished \"The Triumph of Life\", which Harold Bloom has called \"the most despairing poem he wrote\".\nDeath.\nOn 1 July, Shelley and Edward Williams sailed in Shelley's new boat the \"Don Juan\" to Livorno where Shelley met Leigh Hunt and Byron in order to make arrangements for a new journal, \"The Liberal\". After the meeting, on 8 July, Shelley, Williams and their boat boy sailed out of Livorno for Lerici. A few hours later, the \"Don Juan\" and its inexperienced crew were lost in a storm. The vessel, an open boat, had been custom-built in Genoa for Shelley. Mary Shelley declared in her \"Note on Poems of 1822\" (1839) that the design had a defect and that the boat was never seaworthy. In fact the \"Don Juan\" was overmasted; the sinking was due to a severe storm and poor seamanship of the three men on board.\nShelley's badly-decomposed body washed ashore at Viareggio ten days later and was identified by Trelawny from the clothing and a copy of Keats's \"Lamia\" in a jacket pocket. On 16 August, his body was cremated on a beach near Viareggio and the ashes were buried in the Protestant Cemetery of Rome.\nThe day after the news of his death reached England, the Tory London newspaper \"The Courier\" printed: \"Shelley, the writer of some infidel poetry, has been drowned; \"now\" he knows whether there is God or no.\"\nShelley's ashes were reburied in a different plot at the cemetery in 1823. His grave bears the Latin inscription \"Cor Cordium\" (Heart of Hearts), and a few lines of \"Ariel's Song\" from Shakespeare's \"The Tempest\":Nothing of him that doth fadeBut doth suffer a sea changeInto something rich and strange.\nShelley's heart.\nWhen Shelley's body was cremated on the beach, his \"unusually small\" heart resisted burning, possibly due to calcification from an earlier tubercular infection. Trelawny gave the scorched heart to Hunt, who preserved it in spirits of wine and refused to hand it over to Mary. He finally relented and the heart was eventually buried either at St Peter's Church, Bournemouth or in Christchurch Priory.\nFamily history.\nShelley's paternal grandfather was Bysshe Shelley (21 June 1731 \u2013 6 January 1815), who, in 1806, became Sir Bysshe Shelley, First Baronet of Castle Goring. On Sir Bysshe's death in 1815, Shelley's father inherited the baronetcy, becoming Sir Timothy Shelley.\nShelley was the eldest of several legitimate children. Bieri argues that Shelley had an older illegitimate brother but, if he existed, little is known of him. His younger siblings were: John (1806\u20131866), Margaret (1801\u20131887), Hellen (1799\u20131885), Mary (1797\u20131884), Hellen (1796\u20131796, died in infancy) and Elizabeth (1794\u20131831).\nShelley had two children by his first wife Harriet: Eliza Ianthe Shelley (1813\u20131876) and Charles Bysshe Shelley (1814\u20131826). He had four children by his second wife Mary: an unnamed daughter born in 1815 who only survived ten days; William Shelley (1816\u20131819); Clara Everina Shelley (1817\u20131818); and Percy Florence Shelley (1819\u20131889). Shelley also declared himself to be the father of Elena Adelaide Shelley (1818\u20131820), who might have been an illegitimate or adopted daughter. His son Percy Florence became the Third Baronet of Castle Goring in 1844, following the death of Sir Timothy Shelley.\nPolitical, religious and ethical views.\nPolitics.\nShelley was a political radical who was influenced by thinkers such as Rousseau, Paine, Godwin, Wollstonecraft, and Leigh Hunt. He advocated Catholic Emancipation, republicanism, parliamentary reform, the extension of the franchise, freedom of speech and peaceful assembly, an end to aristocratic and clerical privilege, and a more equal distribution of income and wealth. The views he expressed in his published works were often more moderate than those he advocated privately, because of the risk of prosecution for seditious libel and his desire not to alienate more moderate friends and political allies. Nevertheless, his political writings and activism brought him to the attention of the Home Office and he came under government surveillance at various periods.\nShelley's most influential political work in the years immediately following his death was the poem \"Queen Mab\", which included extensive notes on political themes. The work went through 14 official and pirated editions by 1845, and became popular in Owenist and Chartist circles. His longest political essay, \"A Philosophical View of Reform\", was written in 1820, but not published until 1920.\nNonviolence.\nShelley's advocacy of nonviolent resistance was largely based on his reflections on the French Revolution and rise of Napoleon, and his belief that violent protest would increase the prospect of a military despotism. Although Shelley sympathised with supporters of Irish independence, such as Peter Finnerty and Robert Emmet, he did not support violent rebellion. In his early pamphlet \"An Address, to the Irish People\" (1812) he wrote: \"I do not wish to see things changed now, because it cannot be done without violence, and we may assure ourselves that none of us are fit for any change, however good, if we condescend to employ force in a cause we think right.\"\nIn his later essay \"A Philosophical View of Reform\", Shelley did concede that there were political circumstances in which force might be justified: \"The last resort of resistance is undoubtably [\"sic\"] insurrection. The right of insurrection is derived from the employment of armed force to counteract the will of the nation.\" Shelley supported the 1820 armed rebellion against absolute monarchy in Spain, and the 1821 armed Greek uprising against Ottoman rule.\nShelley's poem \"The Mask of Anarchy\" (written in 1819, but first published in 1832) has been called \"perhaps the first modern statement of the principle of nonviolent resistance\". Gandhi was familiar with the poem and it is possible that Shelley had an indirect influence on Gandhi through Henry David Thoreau's \"Civil Disobedience\".\nReligion.\nShelley was an avowed atheist, who was influenced by the materialist arguments in Holbach's \"Le Syst\u00e8me de la nature\". His atheism was an important element of his political radicalism as he saw organised religion as inextricably linked to social oppression. The overt and implied atheism in many of his works raised a serious risk of prosecution for religious libel. His early pamphlet \"The Necessity of Atheism\" was withdrawn from sale soon after publication following a complaint from a priest. His poem \"Queen Mab\", which includes sustained attacks on the priesthood, Christianity and religion in general, was twice prosecuted by the Society for the Suppression of Vice in 1821. A number of his other works were edited before publication to reduce the risk of prosecution.\nFree love.\nShelley's advocacy of free love drew heavily on the work of Mary Wollstonecraft and the early work of William Godwin. In his notes to \"Queen Mab\", he wrote: \"A system could not well have been devised more studiously hostile to human happiness than marriage.\" He argued that the children of unhappy marriages \"are nursed in a systematic school of ill-humour, violence and falsehood\". He believed that the ideal of chastity outside marriage was \"a monkish and evangelical superstition\" which led to the hypocrisy of prostitution and promiscuity.\nShelley believed that \"sexual connection\" should be free among those who loved each other and last only as long as their mutual love. Love should also be free and not subject to obedience, jealousy and fear. He denied that free love would lead to promiscuity and the disruption of stable human relationships, arguing that relationships based on love would generally be of long duration and marked by generosity and self-devotion.\nWhen Shelley's friend T. J. Hogg made an unwanted sexual advance to Shelley's first wife Harriet, Shelley forgave him of his \"horrible error\" and assured him that he was not jealous. It is very likely that Shelley encouraged Hogg and Shelley's second wife Mary to have a sexual relationship.\nVegetarianism.\nShelley converted to a vegetable diet in early March 1812 and sustained it, with occasional lapses, for the remainder of his life. Shelley's vegetarianism was influenced by ancient authors such as Hesiod, Pythagoras, Socrates, Plato, Ovid and Plutarch, but more directly by John Frank Newton, author of \"The Return to Nature, or, A Defence of the Vegetable Regimen\" (1811). Shelley wrote two essays on vegetarianism: \"A Vindication of Natural Diet\" (1813) and \"On the Vegetable System of Diet\" (written circa 1813\u20131815, but first published in 1929). William Owen Jones argues that Shelley's advocacy of vegetarianism was strikingly modern, emphasising its health benefits, the alleviation of animal suffering, the inefficient use of agricultural land involved in animal husbandry, and the economic inequality resulting from the commercialisation of animal food production. Shelley's life and works inspired the founding of the Vegetarian Society in England (1847) and directly influenced the vegetarianism of George Bernard Shaw and perhaps Gandhi.\nReception and influence.\nShelley's work was not widely read in his lifetime outside a small circle of friends, poets and critics. Most of his poetry, drama and fiction was published in editions of 250 copies which generally sold poorly. Only \"The Cenci\" went to an authorised second edition while Shelley was alive \u2013 in contrast, Byron's \"The Corsair\" (1814) sold out its first edition of 10,000 copies in one day.\nThe initial reception of Shelley's work in mainstream periodicals (with the exception of the liberal \"Examiner\") was generally unfavourable. Reviewers often launched personal attacks on Shelley's private life and political, social and religious views, even when conceding that his poetry contained beautiful imagery and poetic expression. There was also criticism of Shelley's intelligibility and style, Hazlitt describing it as \"a passionate dream, a straining after impossibilities, a record of fond conjectures, a confused embodying of vague abstraction\".\nShelley's poetry soon gained a wider audience in radical and reformist circles. \"Queen Mab\" became popular with Owenists and Chartists, and \"Revolt of Islam\" influenced poets sympathetic to the workers' movement such as Thomas Hood, Thomas Cooper and William Morris.\nHowever, Shelley's mainstream following did not develop until a generation after his death. Bieri argues that editions of Shelley's poems published in 1824 and 1839 were edited by Mary Shelley to highlight her late husband's lyrical gifts and downplay his radical ideas. Matthew Arnold famously described Shelley as a \"beautiful and ineffectual angel\".\nShelley was a major influence on a number of important poets in the following decades, including Robert Browning, Swinburne, Hardy and Yeats. Shelley-like characters frequently appeared in nineteenth-century literature, such as Scythrop in Peacock's \"Nightmare Abbey\", Ladislaw in George Eliot's \"Middlemarch\" and Angel Clare in Hardy's \"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\".\nTwentieth-century critics such as Eliot, Leavis, Allen Tate and Auden variously criticised Shelley's poetry for deficiencies in style, \"repellent\" ideas, and immaturity of intellect and sensibility. However, Shelley's critical reputation rose from the 1960s as a new generation of critics highlighted Shelley's debt to Spenser and Milton, his mastery of genres and verse forms, and the complex interplay of sceptical, idealist and materialist ideas in his work. American literary critic Harold Bloom describes him as \"a superb craftsman, a lyric poet without rival, and surely one of the most advanced sceptical intellects ever to write a poem\". According to Donald H. Reiman, \"Shelley belongs to the great tradition of Western writers that includes Dante, Shakespeare and Milton\".\nLegacy.\nShelley died leaving many of his works unfinished, unpublished or published in expurgated versions with multiple errors. There have been a number of recent projects aimed at establishing reliable editions of his manuscripts and works. Among the most notable of these are:\nShelley's long-lost \"Poetical Essay on the Existing State of Things\" (1811) was rediscovered in 2006 and subsequently made available online by the Bodleian Library in Oxford.\nJohn Lauritsen and Charles E. Robinson have argued that Shelley's contribution to Mary Shelley's novel \"Frankenstein\" was extensive and that he should be considered a collaborator or co-author. Professor Charlotte Gordon and others have disputed this contention. Fiona Sampson has said: \"In recent years Percy's corrections, visible in the \"Frankenstein\" notebooks held at the Bodleian Library in Oxford, have been seized on as evidence that he must have at least co-authored the novel. In fact, when I examined the notebooks myself, I realised that Percy did rather less than any line editor working in publishing today.\"\nThe Keats\u2013Shelley Memorial Association, founded in 1903, supports the Keats\u2013Shelley House in Rome which is a museum and library dedicated to the Romantic writers with a strong connection with Italy. The association is also responsible for maintaining the grave of Percy Bysshe Shelley in the non-Catholic Cemetery at Testaccio. The association publishes the scholarly \"Keats\u2013Shelley Review\". It also runs the annual Keats\u2013Shelley and Young Romantics Writing Prizes and the Keats\u2013Shelley Fellowship.\nSelected works.\nWorks are listed by estimated year of composition.

{"title": "Anatol_E._Baconsky", "label": "Writer", "text": "Anatol E. Baconsky (; June 16, 1925 \u2013 March 4, 1977), also known as A. E. Bakonsky, Baconschi or Baconski, was a Romanian modernist poet, essayist, translator, novelist, publisher, literary and art critic. Praised for his late approach to poetry and prose, which transgresses the genres and introduces an aestheticized, original and progressively dark perspective to Romanian literature, he was also criticized for his early commitment to Socialist Realism and communism. Much of his work belongs to the field of travel literature, recording his experiences in the Eastern Bloc, the Far East and Soviet Union, and finally Central Europe. He was also a critically acclaimed translator of foreign works, including the \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\" and poems by Jorge Sempr\u00fan, Artur Lundkvist and others, the author of world literature anthologies, and the editor of monographs on Romanian and foreign painters.\nAfter a brief affiliation to Surrealism in the 1940s, Baconsky was a prominent supporter of the communist regime who joined its cultural establishment. In the mid-1950s, he grew disillusioned with communist guidelines\u2014this attitude was notably manifested in his activity as editor of the Cluj-based magazine \"Steaua\" (where he reacted against the prevailing censorship), his 1972 public reaction against the norms imposed by the Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu regime, and his samizdat novel \"Biserica neagr\u0103\" (\"The Black Church\"). Having spent much of final years in Austria and West Berlin, where he became a critic of consumerism, Baconsky died in Bucharest, a victim of the 1977 earthquake.\nAnatol E. Baconsky was the elder brother of Leon Baconsky, a literary historian and academic, and the father of writer and diplomat Teodor Baconschi.\nBiography.\nEarly life.\nBorn in village, northern Bessarabia (presently Konovka, Ukraine), he was the eldest son of Eftimie Baconsky, a Romanian Orthodox priest, whose name he used as his patronymic middle name (usually marked by the initial). His brother Leon was born in 1928, around the time when the Baconsky family was spending long intervals in Drepc\u0103u\u0163i, a locality on the Prut River shore. In 1936\u20131944, he was in Chi\u0219in\u0103u, where he attended the Alecu Russo Gymnasium and High School, publishing his first poems in the school magazine \"Mugurel\" during 1942. During those years, Romania was engaged on the Axis side in the war against the Soviet Union, and Bessarabia soon became part of the Eastern Front, before King Michael's Coup and the start of Soviet occupation brought Nazi German influence to an end (\"see Romania during World War II\"). The Baconskys left the region, and Anatol attended the Lahovary High School in R\u00e2mnicu V\u00e2lcea (1944\u20131945). Eventually, the family settled in Ciom\u0103ge\u0219ti, Arge\u0219 County, while Anatol took his baccalaureate (June 1945) and briefly worked at a factory in the Transylvanian town of Cisn\u0103die.\nIn November 1945, Baconsky moved to Cluj. He began his studies at the University of Cluj's Faculty of Law, while attending lectures in Philosophy and Aesthetics given by Lucian Blaga and Eugeniu Sperantia. His first essay, which Baconsky considered his actual debut work, was published by the \"Tribuna Nou\u0103\" newspaper. Beginning 1946, his work was given more exposure, and was published in local Transylvanian journals (such as the Carei-based \"Prietenii Artei\") before being featured in the collective volume \"Antologia prim\u0103verii\" (\"The Anthology of Spring\"). He was at the time an adherent to Surrealism, and a volume of his Surrealist poetry was supposed to be edited by Editura Funda\u0163iilor Regale, but never saw print, owing to the institution's disestablishment by the new communist authorities. Literary historian Mircea Braga writes that, over the following years, Baconsky showed himself to be a staunch critic of Surrealism, and quotes him defining Andr\u00e9 Breton's pupils as followers of a \"rigid dogma\". Literary critic and academic Diana C\u00e2mpan also that the split with Surrealism and the avant-garde was a sign of his belief that negation could only result in value if substantiated, as well as his theory that aesthetic revolt, after manifesting itself as a disease, was degenerating into kitsch.\nDiscarding Surrealism soon after, Baconsky moved to a poetic version of Socialist Realism, partly influenced by the Soviet Proletkult tradition (\"see Socialist realism in Romania\"). In 1949, the year of his graduation, Baconsky was a regional delegate to the Writers' Congress in Bucharest, a conference which led to the creation of the Romanian Writers' Union (USR). Also in 1949, he joined the writing staff of the \"Lupta Ardealului\" journal, and married Clara Popa, a student at the University of Cluj's Faculty of Letters. In October, his poetry was published in a bilingual almanac co-edited by Romanian and Hungarian writers (it was titled \"\u00cempreun\u0103\" in Romanian and \"Egy\u00fctt\" in Hungarian, both words meaning \"Together\").\nEarly years at \"Steaua\".\nIn 1950, Baconsky completed his first volume, \"Poezii\" (\"Poems\", published by the USR's Editura de stat pentru literatur\u0103 \u015fi art\u0103). The following year, he printed another book of poetry, \"Copiii din Valea Arie\u0219ului\" (\"The Children of the Arie\u0219 Valley\"). The new editor was by then involved in a number of disputes with other young authors, in particular those grouped around the Sibiu Literary Circle, among them \u0218tefan Augustin Doina\u0219 and Nicolae Balot\u0103.\nIt was at that stage that he began collaborating with \"Almanahul Literar\", a newly founded magazine edited by communist poet Miron Radu Paraschivescu, which, in 1954, was renamed \"Steaua\". Among his early assignments there was his participation on the literary jury that granted the magazine's annual prize (alongside literary men such as Paraschivescu, Emil Isac, Dumitru Micu, and Iosif Pervain). In one notable incident of 1950, the panel honored a high school student named Ion Motoarc\u0103, without being aware that Motoarc\u0103's communist poetry was in fact a parody of Socialist Realist literature, authored as a prank by Baconsky's rival Doina\u0219. As was revealed decades later, Doina\u0219 continued to ridicule the \"Steaua\" writers over several months, and, when he decided that the risk of repercussions was far too great, simply put an end to the prank. This he did by having Motoarc\u0103 decline all of Baconsky's suggestions with the claim that one \"should not take lessons from a less gifted poet than himself.\" In parallel, Anatol E. Baconsky's relationship with Paraschivescu was tense: in February 1951, at a USR meeting in Bucharest, he was one of those who criticized Baconsky's new take on lyric poetry, accusing him of \"intimism\".\nHowever, in 1952, Paraschivescu left for Bra\u015fov, and Baconsky took over as editor of \"Steaua\", progressively changing its profile and shaping it into a literary and art magazine. Fellow poet and essayist Matei C\u0103linescu, who was acquainted with Baconsky and later joined the \"Steaua\" group, believes his older colleague had been \"rewarded\" the position by the ruling Romanian Communist Party. In parallel, he established contacts with young authors in Bucharest, who became \"Steaua\"s circle in the capital: C\u0103linescu, Cezar Baltag, Gabriel Dimisianu, Grigore Hagiu, Mircea Iv\u0103nescu, Modest Morariu, Nichita St\u0103nescu and Petre Stoica.\nBaconsky also published poems in \"Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\" magazine, including the 1951 \"Noapte \u00een fl\u0103c\u0103ri\" (\"Night Ablaze\"). In 1952, he was working on translating Stepan Schipachov's poem about Pavlik Morozov, a Soviet boy who had denounced his family for opposing Soviet collectivization, and, after being killed by them, had been celebrated as a communist hero. He was in the process of publishing a series of reportages about the lives of Romanian workers, and, in 1952, stated that he intended to write poetry about life in the factories at Brad, which he had visited. Some of his poems were published in the 1952 volume \"Poezie nou\u0103 \u00een R.P.R.\" (\"New Poetry in the P[eople's] R[epublic of] R[omania]\"), together with those of Maria Banu\u015f, Dan De\u015fliu, Mihu Dragomir, Eugen Frunz\u0103, \u015etefan Iure\u015f, Eugen Jebeleanu, Veronica Porumbacu, Alexandru Toma and twenty-four others.\nFrom \"Itinerar bulgar\" to \"Fluxul memoriei\".\nIn January 1953, the 26-year-old poet left Romania on his first trip abroad, visiting the People's Republic of Bulgaria. Back in Bucharest during March, he was present at a USR meeting indirectly provoked by the death of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, during which they were confronted with the new cultural guidelines stated by Georgy Malenkov. A condemnation of the first- and second-generation proletkult writers, it saw Baconsky both as a critic and a target of criticism. His volume of reportage from the Bulgarian travel, \"Itinerar bulgar\" (\"Bulgarian Itinerary\"), saw print in 1954, together with the poetry collection \"C\u00eentece de zi \u015fi noapte\" (\"Songs of Day and Night\", awarded the State Prize in 1955).\nIn 1998, literary critic Cornel Ungureanu proposed that, by that moment, Baconsky was finding his voice as a \"rebellious author\". According to C\u0103linescu, the Baconsky of the late 1950s had \"completely changed his orientation\". Writing for \"Steaua\" in 1955, Baconsky submitted an essay reviewing and promoting the work of George Bacovia, a Symbolist and pessimist who had been largely ignored by post-1948 critics (\"see Symbolist movement in Romania\").\nBaconsky was again a USR delegate in June 1956, when he presented the body with the first of his reports, dealing with the state of Romanian poetry. This congress, literary critic Paul Cernat notes, coincided with a period when writers sought a \"regeneration\", to correspond with the relaxation brought by the death of Stalin. Also that year, he published his \"Dou\u0103 poeme\" (\"Two Poems\") book, comprising \"C\u00eentecul verii acesteia\" (\"This Summer's Song\") and \"Lucr\u0103ri \u015fi anotimpuri sau Mi\u015fcarea de revolu\u0163ie\" (\"Labors and Seasons or The Orbital Revolution\"). In autumn, he left for the Soviet Union and the Far East, visiting North Korea, the People's Republic of China, and Siberian areas.\nBeginning summer 1956, the communist regime clamped down on the cultural environment, its apprehension motivated by events in Communist Poland, the scene of anti-communist workers' protests, and Communist Hungary, where an anti-Soviet revolt eventually broke out. According to historian Vladimir Tism\u0103neanu, Baconsky was one of the writers informed of the decision taken by communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej not to endorse liberalization and destalinization, particularly after the events in Hungary threatened to disrupt communism throughout the Eastern Bloc, and at a time when the regime condemned advocates of change (Miron Constantinescu, Mihail Davidoglu, Alexandru Jar and Ion Vitner).\nAnatol E. Baconsky was again present in poetry with the 1957 volume \"Dincolo de iarn\u0103\" (\"Beyond Winter\"). According to Braga, it was the moment in which his poetry made decisive gains in originality, and the first stage in his renunciation of \"Proletkult versification\". It was followed by a collection of critical essays, \"Colocviu critic\" (\"Critical Colloquy\"). In October\u2013November, Baconsky was again a traveler to the Soviet Union, reaching Moscow, Leningrad and the Baltic, and the northern Black Sea shore. Late in the year, he issued \"Fluxul memoriei\" (\"The Flow of Memory\"), seen by Braga as \"essential in the development of his poetry.\"\nMove to Bucharest and debut in publishing.\nBy 1958, Baconsky became a target of criticism in the literary community. The reaction, Braga noted, was \"vehement\", and, in January 1959, got Baconsky dismissed from his position as editor of \"Steaua\". In October of that year, the poet left Cluj and settled in Bucharest. According to Ungureanu, the capital was \"hostile\" to Baconsky, and the move was the equivalent of an \"internal exile\".\nOver the following decade, he focused mainly on reeding his earlier volumes of poetry, on publishing works of criticism and travel writing, and on translating works by various authors. His new home became a gathering spot for young writers who did not approve of communism's cultural guidelines, including C\u0103linescu and other Bucharesters who had previously published their work in \"Steaua\".\nIn 1960, Baconsky published his translation of early Korean poetry (\"Poe\u0163i clasici coreeni\") and the reportage volume \"C\u0103l\u0103torii \u00een Europa \u015fi Asia\" (\"Travels in Europe and Asia\"), comprising both new works and a reprint of \"Itinerar bulgar\". The following year, he reprinted some of his poems under the title \"Versuri\" (\"Verses\"), and authored a similarly titled translation from the Italian modernist Salvatore Quasimodo (reprinted 1968). These were followed in 1962 by his translation of \"The Long Voyage\", a novel by Spanish author Jorge Sempr\u00fan (published in Romania under the title \"Marea c\u0103l\u0103torie\"), and the cycle \"Meridiane\" (\"Meridians\"), comprising essays on 20th century literature, and published over three years by the magazine \"Contemporanul\". Also in 1962, Baconsky published the poetry volume \"Imn c\u0103tre zorii de zi\" (\"A Hymn to Daybreak\"), and presented a second Writers' Union report (\"Situa\u0163ia poeziei universale contemporane\", \"The State of Contemporary Universal Poetry\"). He also left on an extended tour of Moldavia and Northern Dobruja, spending much time in the Danube Delta.\nA year later, he published a translation of selected poems by Swedish author Artur Lundkvist, an anthology of his own translations from foreign writers (titled \"Poe\u0163i \u015fi poezie\"\u2014\"Poetry and Poets\"\u2014and featuring Baconsky's short essays as introductions for each of the authors). His work of the time also comprises the guide book \"Cluj \u015fi \u00eemprejurimile sale. Mic \u00eendreptar turistic\" (\"Cluj and Its Surroundings. A Concise Tourist Guide\"). In 1964, having published a new collected volume of his poetry, Baconsky also completed a translation of \"Mah\u0101bh\u0101rata\", an ancient Indian epic. Illustrated by Marcela Cordescu in its original print, it carried the subtitle \"Arderea zmeilor\" (\"Burning of the \"Zmei\"\"). His new poetry volume, \"Fiul risipitor\" (Romanian for \"The Prodigal Son\"), saw print in 1965.\nEarly Ceau\u015fescu years.\nBaconsky's situation improved during Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's final years in power, and particularly after Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu's arrival at the head of the Communist Party inaugurated a period of liberalization. The poet was elected to the Writers' Union Leadership Committee in February 1965. The same month, in this official capacity, he was allowed to travel outside the Iron Curtain and into Western Europe: he was in Austria, invited by the \"\u00d6sterreichische Gesellschaft f\u00fcr Literatur\", and also visited France and Italy. Upon his return in April, he passed through Yugoslavia, being welcomed by the Union of Yugoslav Writers. Owing to his new contacts abroad, Baconsky began publishing his work in international reviews, among them France's \"Cahiers de L'Herne\"; Austria's \"Literatur und Kritik\" and \"Die Presse\"; and West Germany's \"Die Welt\", \"Akzente\" and \"Das Ensemble\". Following his return, Baconsky published his essay volume \"Meridiane\" and a selection of poems translated from the American Carl Sandburg. His own lyrics were published in a Hungarian translation, authored by poet S\u00e1ndor K\u00e1ny\u00e1di. In 1966, \"Die Welt\" published the report Baconsky sent to writers participating in the International Congress held in Austria.\nIn 1967, the writer completed work on his collection of old poetry and new pieces, also titled \"Fluxul memoriei\" (\"The Flow of Memory\"), and published his debut short story volume, \"Echinoxul nebunilor \u015fi alte povestiri\" (\"The Madmen's Equinox and Other Stories\"). He revisited Italy and Austria, and, in 1968, traveled to West Germany. In his 1968 two-volume book \"Remember\" (title in the original), he republished his earlier travel writings into the East with modifications, and added an account of his western travels, headlined \"Fals jurnal de c\u0103l\u0103torie\" (\"False Travel Journal\"). He also hosted a weekly National Radio program, titled \"Meridiane lirice\" (\"Lyrical Meridians\")\u2014Baconsky read his introductions to works by various writers, and Romanian theater stars read fragments of their work.\nIn November, Anatol E. Baconsky was reelected to the Writers' Union Committee, and, in 1969, his \"Remember\" was awarded \"Steaua\" 's annual prize. He visited the Hungarian capital Budapest, invited by the local branch of the International PEN. Late in 1969, he published the poetry volume \"Cadavre \u00een vid\" (\"Thermoformed Dead Bodies\"), which was granted the 1970 Award by the Writers' Union. Also in 1970, his \"Echinoxul nebunilor\" was translated into German by Austrian author Max Demeter Peyfuss, being released in Austria, West Germany and Switzerland. The Romanian writer attended the event in Vienna, before leaving for Paris. The following year, he traveled to West Germany and again to Austria. Over the following three years, these visits were depicted by Baconsky in his permanent column at the journal \"Magazin\". He also published his first volume on the art of Romania\u2014a monograph dedicated to and named after painter Dimitrie Ghia\u0163\u0103.\nFinal years.\nBy 1971, Baconsky was outraged by the Ceau\u015fescu regime having curbed ideological relaxation and proclaimed a Romanian \"cultural revolution\" (\"see July Theses\"). The following year, invited to a meeting with the new President, he joined sculptor George Apostu in publicly questioning the new guidelines.\nIn February 1972, he settled in West Berlin, after the Academy of Sciences and Humanities offered to host him for one year. He traveled outside the city: invited to Scandinavia by the Swedish Institute, he visited Denmark and Sweden (crossing the Arctic Circle during one trip); he also attended the International Writers' Congress in Austria, and made additional visits to Belgium and the Netherlands. His volume on the art of Ion \u0162uculescu was published at home during that time.\nHis 1973 anthology of world poetry, \"Panorama poeziei universale\" (\"The Panorama of Universal Poetry\"), was noted by Hungarian literary historian J\u00e1nos Kohn among similar Romanian works of the period (including Ion Caraion's collection of American poetry), as an important step in the history of Romanian translations. The book, based on the \"Meridiane lirice\" program, comprised works by 99 authors, from Endre Ady to William Butler Yeats. Cernat calls the volume \"fundamental\". All translations were done by Baconsky himself, whose effort was rewarded by the Writers' Union with its 1973 prize.\nTogether with other poets, he traveled again to Budapest, as part of a cultural exchange between Hungary and Romania, and, in 1974, was again on leave in Italy (invited by academics in the fields of philology and Romanic languages), Austria, and ultimately West Berlin (where the Academy organized a gala in his honor). In 1975, he printed his last anthumous work, an album-monograph dedicated to Quattrocento painter Sandro Botticelli (published by Editura Meridiane). He had completed work on his only novel, \"Biserica neagr\u0103\", whose anti-communist undertones meant that it could not be published at home. Instead, the text circulated in \"samizdat\" form, and was made into a series by the Munich-based Radio Free Europe, which broadcast clandestinely inside Romania.\nIn March 1977, Baconsky and his wife Clara fell victims to the 7.2 Mw Vrancea earthquake which devastated Bucharest. At the time, Baconsky was preparing for a new trip abroad: complying with Communist Romania's restrictions on the use of passports, he had just asked authorities to release the document, and was carrying it on his person. His last volumes, \"Biserica neagr\u0103\" and \"Corabia lui Sebastian\" (\"Sebastian's Ship\"), remained unpublished.\nWork, style and creative periods.\nCommunism and Socialist Realism.\nAfter his short affiliation to Surrealism, a style which is almost entirely absent from his published work, Baconsky embraced a style which reflected his communist sympathies, and which is most often seen as the source of some of his poorest work. Cornel Ungureanu describes the early 1950s Baconsky as \"an exponent of socialist realism\" and a \"passionate supporter of the communist utopia\"; his stance in respect to the authorities was described by literary historian Alex Drace-Francis as \"conformist\" (a word also used by C\u0103linescu), while Paul Cernat circumscribes Baconsky to the \"pure and tough Stalinism\" of the day.\nHis early works are seen by literary critic Sorin Tomu\u021ba as \"an unfortunate debut with conjectural lyrics\". Likened by Matei C\u0103linescu to the debut writings of the younger communist author Dan De\u015fliu, they became the topic of criticism from as early as the Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu years: Mircea Braga called them \"platitudes\" and \"at most, documents for a certain mindset and 'artistic' practice\", noting that their own author had come to reject them in later years. He also cites fellow critic Alexandru Piru, who defines Baconsky's early productions as bearing \"the strong imprint of journalism\".\nThis series included controversial stanzas about communization, the Romanian collectivization process, and class struggle against wealthy peasants known as \"chiaburi\" (Romanian for \"kulaks\"). Other portions of his work were dedicated to industrialization policies, around subjects related to Brad factories. Discussing his projects for 1952 in an interview with \"Contemporanul\", Baconsky explained: \"I am especially interested in the matter of engineers who rose from the ranks of young workers. I want to follow [their] transformation on all levels and create the figure of a young engineer in one of my poems.\" One of his best-known poems of the period has to do with the \"chiaburi\", and includes the lines:\nOther such lyrics read:\nFormer Romanian Communist Party activist Pavel \u021augui, whose opinions diverged from the party line, claimed that, in effect, Baconsky was writing with subversive undertones from the time of his debut\u2014literary chronicler Bogdan Cre\u0163u renders this opinion, but expresses doubt, calling \u021augui \"dubious\" and \"in reality, a \"politruk\" as sinister as all the others.\" Literary historian Eugen Simion also proposed that Baconsky was, in effect, parodying agitprop literature of the day. Analyzing Baconsky's early political views, his biographer Crina Bud concludes that the poet was attracted into cooperation in order to make a living, and that, from the very start, he was playing a number of different and conflicting \"roles\".\nThe writer was already noted for being a man of refined tastes and for being interested by universal culture. Both Cre\u0163u and Cernat define him as \"a dandy of communism\". The \"dandy\" trait had also been noted by Eugen Simion. Simion, who recorded his impression of Baconsky, spoke of his \"romantic beauty\", \"sartorial elegance\", and a form of \"melancholy\" which, he argued, recalled that displayed by 19th century author G\u00e9rard de Nerval. Historian Vladimir Tism\u0103neanu sees Anatol E. Baconsky as one of the few genuine left-wing intellectuals who remained associated with the regime throughout the 1950s (in his definition, the group also comprised Geo Bogza, Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu, Geo Dumitrescu, Petru Dumitriu, Paul Georgescu, Gheorghe Haupt, Eugen Jebeleanu, Mihail Petroveanu and Nicolae Tertulian).\nDuring his period at \"Steaua\", Baconsky encouraged young authors to express themselves and created, what both Tomu\u0163a and Cre\u0163u define as a \"literary oasis\". Tism\u0103neanu however criticizes the writer and other leftists on the cultural scene for not reacting against the post-1956 repressive mood, and argues that their inaction helped ideologists Leonte R\u0103utu and his subordinate Mihai Beniuc to restore Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej's control over the Writers' Union.\nA particular controversy involves allegations against the young Baconsky for the way in which he treated his colleagues. Many voices in the literary community have come to suspect that he was an informant for the Securitate secret police, and that his reports helped in the arrest of other writers. Crina Bud proposes that, if such accounts are true, Baconsky may have used the Securitate in order to silence those who competed with him for the approval of his teacher, philosopher Lucian Blaga. The accusations are traced by Cernat to two separate sources: Baconsky's adversaries in the Sibiu Literary Circle and Securitate general Nicolae Ple\u015fi\u0163\u0103. During his early activities in Cluj, Baconsky is also alleged to have partaken in the marginalization of a less enthusiastic writer, Ion Dezideriu S\u00eerbu, who was later to become a political prisoner (in S\u00eerbu's memoirs, Baconsky is singled out as one of those who betrayed his confidence).\nBreak with communism.\nDespite initially complying with ideological requirements, Baconsky was often subject to criticism in the official press. This occurred frequently after 1953, when Soviet politico Georgy Malenkov disavowed proletkult, criticizing its exponents for having authored a bland and distant form of literature (an accusation which Baconsky was regularly faced with from that moment on). Criticism was expressed early on by poet Veronica Porumbacu, who reproached him having published too little \"when the people is asking us to participate with all forces in the struggle.\" Also in 1953, Paul Georgescu, literary columnist at \"Sc\u00eenteia\", the main Communist Party organ, reacted against the \"Steaua\" leadership, and argued that Baconsky personally had developed \"a high-flown style, designed to hide his unfamiliarity with life and lack of ideas.\" Georgescu also claimed that Baconsky's travel accounts had failed to show \"how [Bulgarian] people live, how this country looks today [...]\", and that his poems displayed various ideological mistakes. Writing for \"Via\u0163a Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103\", critic Eugen Campus endorsed earlier pronouncements and added that, although Baconsky was a \"talented poet\", he found his contributions showed \"a tendency to repeat oneself\u2014for all the originality it covets\". Literary historian Ana Selejan notes that, upon the end of the debates, the poet found himself was \"blacklisted\" by the official critics.\nIn parallel, Baconsky criticized other writers on similar grounds. He aimed such remarks at his fellow poet Eugen Frunz\u0103, which brought him additional criticism from Georgescu and Mircea Gafi\u0163a. Several of Baconsky's poems, in particular the 1953 \"Rutin\u0103\" (\"Routine\"), satirize authors who did not seek to make their poems interesting to the general public. The latter, Selejan proposes, may be a covert reference to and ironic pastiche of Mihai Beniuc, one of the Socialist Realist poets most trusted by the regime. One of the stanzas reads:\nSelejan also notes that \"Rutin\u0103\", like the war poem \"Manifest\" (\"Manifesto\"), constitute a \"dissonant note\" when compared with other poems of the day, including those of Beniuc. \"Manifest\", which may have been written in honor of the Romanian-hosted World Festival of Youth and Students (1953), and which Selejan believes may display irony toward \"poetic militantism in the present tense\", compares the fate of World War II soldiers with that of post-1945 youth, in meditative lyrics such as:\nProgressively after the late 1950s, Baconsky entirely lost his confidence in communism\u2014an attitude which culminated in his 1972 protest. His disappointment was especially known to his intimate circle. Based on this, Cernat defines the writer as an \"informal anti-communist\", while C\u0103linescu, who recalls participating in such conversations, notes: \"Baconsky [displayed] an emphatic, lucid, irreconcilable anti-communism. Not even later [...] did I meet many people who had a more emphasized contempt, mixed with an intense repulsion, for the representatives of the [communist] party ideology, either within the literary world or outside it.\" He believes Baconsky's stance from 1958 onwards makes him the period's \"only dissident\", although he also notes that the poet criticized the communist system only \"orally\". Cornel Ungureanu, who stresses the importance of both his move to Bucharest and the numerous visits abroad, adds: \"[he] was to walk down a road which most celebrity authors of the 1950s' communist east [...] have walked down on: the one between fanatical exaltation and acute misanthropies.\" According to Bogdan Cre\u0163u, 1967, when \"Echinoxul nebunilor\" was published, was the capital moment in Baconsky's non-compliance with the ideological requirements, with \"more than honorable behavior\" defining the second part of his career. However, Cernat speculates, the theory regarding his alleged collaboration to Securitate may offer clue that Baconsky's new stance was itself orchestrated by the Party, in an attempt to offer him credibility and permit him to sabotage the literary environment.\nBaconsky allowed his intellectual opposition to communism to merge with his activities as a cultural promoter. In addition to promoting the work of George Bacovia, Baconsky had sought to republish the works of Mateiu Caragiale and his Decadent novel \"Craii de Curtea-Veche\", but his efforts had been frustrated, and (according to Eugen Simion, their only effect was that \"Sc\u00eenteia\" resumed its earlier campaign against Caragiale). In the climate of relative liberalization coinciding with Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu's early years in office, his anthologies and essays helped reinstate works of literature who had been previously censored. Ungureanu thus notes that Baconsky reintroduced the Romanian public to works of Central European authors, such as Franz Kafka and Ingeborg Bachmann, and argues: \"He is the first one (or among the first ones) to 'reconquer' the Mitteleuropean space for Romanian culture.\" Cernat portrays him as a \"European humanist with a vast and refined culture\", while Cre\u0163u proposes that Baconsky and his generation colleague \u015etefan Augustin Doina\u015f may be Romania's \"best translators of poetry\". By 1970, Baconsky's younger colleague Gabriel Dimisianu notes, he had become one of the \"writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism, and now were silently parting with it, returning to literature, to actual criticism\". This group, defined by Dimisianu as \"the older allies of my generation\", also includes Paraschivescu, Geo Bogza, Ovid Crohm\u0103lniceanu, Geo Dumitrescu, Eugen Jebeleanu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu, as well as Baconsky's former rival Paul Georgescu.\nLyrical transition.\nFollowing his break with the regime, Baconsky's style underwent major changes. Tomu\u0163a notes he became \"a first-rate stylist\", while Doina\u015f stresses his \"discreet but tenacious self-edification\", leading to \"an ardent consciousness, albeit perhaps belatedly gained\". The new direction, heralded during his time at \"Steaua\", was however much-criticized by the 1950s cultural establishment, who accused him of \"intimism\" and excessive \"lyricism\", and argued that his work was a return to aestheticism and Symbolism. Baconsky resisted such criticism, and, in one of his articles, openly stated that poets needed to return to a lyrical approach: \"Ignoring the rich array of intimate feelings means mutilating the protagonist's personality, depicting him unilaterally, belittling the actual dimensions of his soul.\" Matei C\u0103linescu argues that such a commitment to artistic purity was a sign of \"what we could call the 'aesthetic resistance' to communism.\"\nAccording to Badea, such experiments resulted in Baconsky's originality, \"an anti-metaphoric offensive, built upon the confrontation between the life of lyrical characters with the destiny of ideal lives\". The rejection of \"decorative metaphors\", Cernat notes, was a staple of Baconsky's work, and was explicitly stated in his post-1969 essays. Badea added that this \"Dincolo de iarn\u0103\", and the volumes which followed down to 1965, formed \"the first page in a distinct chapter of our modern lyric poetry.\" Eugen Simion emphasized as the common trait of such poems: \"a voluptuousness in things fading away, in the weariness provoked by the whispers of rain.\" In his definition, Baconsky had become \"an aesthete of melancholy.\"\nBaconsky's poems of the period speak of himself being \"torn\" by the contradictions of destiny, submitted to the command of a nature whose geography, Braga notes, is \"dead\", seeking to undermine his own humanity so as to become the ideal creator. Also according to Mircea Braga, \"the manifesto of [Baconsky's] onthologic unease\" is his \"Imn c\u0103tre nelini\u015fte\" (\"Hymn to Disquiet\"):\nIt was also at this stage that the poet began introducing references to remote or exotic locations in his works. His poems began to speak of mysterious Baltic and Northern European landscapes, of ancient roads, medieval settings and the desolation of history, as well as of Romania's natural sights (the Danube Delta and the Carpathian Mountains) and scenes from Romanian history (involving the Dacians, the Scythes and the Thracians, or the Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great). The pieces show his enduring fascination with water environments, references to which, according to Braga, he used to illustrate the \"all-encompassing dynamic.\"\n\"Cadavre \u00een vid\" and \"Corabia lui Sebastian\".\nWith the somber collection \"Cadavre \u00een vid\", Baconsky entered what Braga calls a \"forth artistic phase\" (after Surrealism, Socialist Realism and the first change in orientation). Braga however insists that the change between the final two phases is not radical, and that they are separated by a break rather than a tear. Braga also believes that, in his depictions of melancholy and disease, Baconsky again focuses on unease and \"the denial of the irreplaceable\" (while letting the reader know that such a denial is \"useless and inefficient\"). In a 1985 essay, poet and critic Dinu Fl\u0103m\u00e2nd discusses \"Cadavre \u00een vid\" as \"a book of suffering, unique in our literature, a tragic perception of the disinherited, a nightmare of teratologic dreams in the new 'electronic season' \". It includes \"Sonet negru\" (\"Black Sonnet\"), which Braga calls an \"exceptional\" sample of \"feverish tensions, infinite searches [...], obscure impulses\":\nMircea Braga writes that this and other late volumes, showing \"a world born out of nightmares\", are the product of several influences: alongside George Bacovia's melancholic poems, they host echoes from both Expressionism and Postmodern literature. Fl\u0103m\u00e2nd ranks the posthumous \"Corabia lui Sebastian\" among \"the best works written in this second half of the [20th] century\", and compares its \"cynicism\" to the existential philosophy of Emil Cioran.\nBy that stage, Baconsky also became noted for theorizing the rejection of \"consumerism\", advocating instead a return to established cultural values. According to Fl\u0103m\u00e2nd's 1985 essay, Baconsky's rejection of \"consumerism\" and the West was decisive, and culminated in a virulent decision of what Baconsky is known to have called \"the occidental pharaoh\". Braga also writes that, in both \"Cadavre \u00een vid\" and \"Corabia lui Sebastian\", Baconsky depicts his own version of a \"crisis of the West\" (the \"Abendland\" forming a setting of one poem), which he believed may have referenced Oswald Spengler's similar verdict (\"see The Decline of the West\"). Diana C\u00e2mpan noted the poems' dystopian imagery: \"The \"Abendland\" is [...] an eerie \"Leviathan\"-like corpus, with attributes defining for humanity's decrepitude, a surrogate, anti-utopian citadel, handled in accordance with the laws of decline which grind the elites as well as the masses, the things as well their reflection\". A part of the eponymous poem reads:\nAccording to Mircea Braga, one of his last interviews shows that, while still criticized for \"aestheticism\", Baconsky merged his lyricism with an interest in social matters. The statement reads: \"The writer is not a politician in the common and consecrated sense of the word. He does however have \"the role of a spiritual ferment\" [italics in the original]. He must not allow people to acquire cerebral obesity. He is always dissatisfied with something or other, his position is that of a permanent antithesis with the surrounding reality.\" Braga believes Baconsky's moral \"rigor\" to bear a \"Transylvanian sign\", and to have been ultimately inspired by the philosophy of Lucian Blaga. The related anti-capitalist vision is questioned by Cernat. The critic indicates that, although sincere in its patriotism, it was also \"compatible\" with the mixture of communism and nationalism introduced by the Ceau\u015fescu regime (\"see National communism\"), and thus similar with the philosophical discourse of Constantin Noica.\nLate prose works.\nWith \"Remember\", Drace-Francis argues, Baconsky advanced a technique first used by avant-garde writers of the 1930s, which transcended the norms imposed by traditional travel accounts in order to express \"the inadequate representational possibilities of traditional forms\" and to comment on the metaphysics of reality. Baconsky thus depicts his journey as an \"interior adventure\". This type of discourse, Drace-Francis contends, was a hint to his readers that the regime would not allow him to recount every detail of his journey. The book nevertheless also doubles as Baconsky's extended critique of the avant-garde of Europe, whose discourse, Diana C\u00e2mpan notes, Baconsky depicted as a form of desecration. In Tomu\u0163a's view, the depiction of Vienna, with a focus on \"the glorious vestiges of the past\", takes the reader on a \"voluptuous time travel.\" In the critic's definition, Baconsky's Vienna encloses a secondary reality, that is \"ideal\", \"aestheticized\", \"fictional\" and \"bookish\".\nDrace-Francis also notes that the climate of relative liberalization and d\u00e9tente of the 1960s not only made such journeys possible, but actually allowed writers the freedom to go beyond stereotyped depictions of capitalism (while it remained uncertain whether Communist Romania's dialog with the West would \"dominate the construction of epistemic value\"). Overall, Cornel Ungureanu comments, Baconsky's accounts of his western travels are marked by \"dark visions of the world.\" Ungureanu sees this as a sign of Baconsky's having \"descended into Hell\". Cernat, who extends his critique of Baconsky's anti-capitalist attitude to \"Remember\", also argues that the author's \"absolute freedom\" of travel under a repressive regime indicates that his work was not perceived as a threat by the communist system.\nBaconsky's prose fiction is closely linked to the themes and style of his poetry. In Braga's view, the fantasy collection \"Echinoxul nebunilor\" is a prosaic representative of its author's early commitment to aestheticism; according to Cernat, its tone is \"apocalyptic\". A characteristic of Baconsky's prose fiction is its resemblance to his poetry works, to the point where they were described by Crina Bud as \"hybrid forms\". In Bogdan Cre\u0163u's view, \"Biserica neagr\u0103\", Baconsky's only novel, is written with \"alexandrine-like purity\". Likewise, the \"Corabia lui Sebastian\" poems were noted for moving into the realm of prose. This transgression of limits summoned objections from prominent literary critic Nicolae Manolescu, who reportedly believed Baconsky's work to be largely without merit.\n\"Biserica neagr\u0103\" is also read as his most subversive work, described by critics as a \"counter-utopia\". Ungureanu sees it as a \"Kafkaesque\" work of absurdist inspiration, and a further sign of the author \"descending into Hell\". Crina Bud links the anti-utopian quality to contemporary writings by, among others, Matei C\u0103linescu (\"Via\u0163a \u015fi opiniile lui Zacharias Lichter\", \"The Life and Opinions of Zacharias Lichter\") and Baconsky's friend Octavian Paler (\"Via\u0163a pe un peron\"\u2014\"Life on a Platform\"; \"Un om norocos\"\u2014\"A Lucky Man\"). Written from the perspective of a sculptor, who is probably a transposition of Baconsky himself, it is a parable of totalitarian command, artistic submission, individual despair and withdrawal. The volume also offers a glimpse into the world of political imprisonment under communism.\nLegacy.\nAnatol E. Baconsky was a noted presence in the literary community of his day, and is believed to have influenced poet, novelist and translator Petre Stoica (who is described by Ungureanu as the writer's \"friend and emulator\"). Baconsky's poems were parodied by Marin Sorescu in his 1964 volume, \"Singur printre poe\u0163i\" (\"Alone among Poets\"). Sorescu's poem, titled \"A. E. Baconsky. Imn c\u0103tre necunoscutul din mine\" (\"Hymn to the Unknown within Me\"), makes use of Baconsky's lyrical style and displays of culture, showing the poet meditating about the ancient Scythian and Thracian peoples. It begins with the lines:\nUnusual episodes involving Baconsky's death were reported by two of his writer friends, Octavian Paler and Petre Stoica\u2014Paler recalled that the only book to have fallen out of his shelf during the 1977 earthquake was \"Remember\"; Stoica told a similar story involving a painting that Baconsky had made, and which he had received as a gift. The writer's death, Cernat writes, was a \"troubling coincidence\" with that of Alexandru Ivasiuc: a former communist who, like Baconsky, had \"radicalized\" his vision and authored non-conformist pieces, Ivasiuc was himself a victim of the 1977 earthquake.\nIn the months following Baconsky's death, his new monograph on Sandro Botticelli, centered on the artist's illustrations for Dante Aligheri's \"Divine Comedy\", was published in Romanian (re-issued in English during 1982). Cartea Rom\u00e2neasc\u0103 reprinted \"Remember\" (1977), then \"Corabia lui Sebastian\" (1978). Also in 1978, his profile was included in \"9 pentru eternitate\" (\"9 for Eternity\"), a volume dedicated to the literary men who had died during the earthquake, and edited by Mircea Micu and Gheorghe Tomozei. Eleven years later, a selection of his art criticism essays was published under the title \"Itinerarii plastice\" (\"Artistic Itineraries\"). \"Biserica neagr\u0103\" was only printed after the 1989 Revolution toppled communism.\nOf the several books dedicated to his life and work, Crina Bud's 2006 volume, \"Rolurile \u015fi rolul lui A. E. Baconsky \u00een cultura rom\u00e2n\u0103\" (\"The Roles and Role of A. E. Baconsky in Romanian Culture\"), is described by reviewers as one of the most complete. Bogdan Cre\u0163u comments that views of Baconsky are traditionally divided between two \"extremist\" positions: \"he was either castigated for his sins of youth [...] or mythicized and raised to a level that his work could not have honored.\" Like Crina Bud, he believes Baconsky to have been a \"vanquisher from a moral point of view\", adding that he earned \"absolution\" from the victims of communism: \"the writer passed the fire ordeal: he confessed.\" However, Cernat believes, Baconsky, like his fellow disillusioned communist Paler, refused to record his disappointment in writing other than allusively.\nBaconsky and his wife Clara were noted art collectors. They owned representative works of Romanian art, particularly modern, including paintings by Dimitrie Ghia\u021b\u0103, \u0218tefan Dimitrescu, Iosif Iser and Lucian Grigorescu, as well as drawings by Constantin Jiquidi, Theodor Pallady and Nicolae Tonitza. Their collection also included 19th century Romanian Orthodox icons and early prints from William Hogarth's \"A Rake's Progress\". In 1982, the family donated these works to the National Museum, which set up a \"Baconsky Collection\". 21 other works were donated to the Museum of Art Collections, where they also form a separate fund. Many of the books owned by Baconsky were donated by his brother Leon to the Library in C\u0103lim\u0103ne\u015fti (which was consequently renamed the \"Anatol E. Baconsky Library\")."}
{"title": "William_F._Buckley_Jr.", "label": "Writer", "text": "William Frank Buckley Jr. (born William Francis Buckley; November 24, 1925 \u2013 February 27, 2008) was an American public intellectual, conservative author and political commentator. In 1955, he founded \"National Review\", a magazine that stimulated the conservative movement in the late-20th century United States. Buckley hosted 1,429 episodes of the public affairs television show \"Firing Line\" (1966\u20131999), the longest-running public affairs show in American television history with a single host, where he became known for his distinctive Mid-Atlantic idiolect and wide vocabulary.\nBorn in New York City, Buckley served stateside in the United States Army during the Second World War. After the war, he attended Yale University, where he engaged in debate and right-wing political commentary. Afterward, he worked for two years in the Central Intelligence Agency. In addition to editorials in \"National Review\", Buckley wrote \"God and Man at Yale\" (1951) and more than fifty other books on diverse topics, including writing, speaking, history, politics, and sailing. His works include a series of novels featuring fictitious CIA agent Blackford Oakes as well as a nationally syndicated newspaper column.\nBuckley called himself both a conservative and a libertarian. George H. Nash, a historian of the modern American conservative movement, said in 2008 that Buckley was \"arguably the most important public intellectual in the United States in the past half century. For an entire generation, he was the preeminent voice of American conservatism and its first great ecumenical figure.\"\nEarly life.\nBuckley was born November 24, 1925, in New York City, the son of Aloise Josephine Antonia (Steiner) and William Frank Buckley Sr., a Texas-born lawyer and oil developer. His mother, from New Orleans, was of Swiss-German, German, and Irish descent, while his paternal grandparents, from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, were of Irish ancestry. The sixth of ten children, Buckley moved as a boy with his family to Mexico, and then to Sharon, Connecticut, before beginning his formal schooling in Paris, where he attended first grade. By age seven, he received his first formal training in English at a day school in London; his first and second languages were Spanish and French. As a boy, Buckley developed a love for music, sailing, horses, hunting, and skiing, all interests reflected in his later writings. He was homeschooled through the eighth grade using the Calvert School of Baltimore's Homeschool Curriculum. Just before World War II, at age 12\u201313, he attended the Jesuit preparatory school St John's Beaumont in England.\nBuckley's father, William Frank Buckley Sr. (1881\u20131958), was an American oil developer whose wealth was based in Mexico. The elder Buckley became influential in Mexican politics during the military dictatorship of Victoriano Huerta but was expelled when leftist general \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n became president in 1920. The younger Buckley had nine siblings, including eldest sister Aloise Buckley Heath, a writer and conservative activist; sister Maureen Buckley-O'Reilly (1933\u20131964), who married Gerald A. O'Reilly, CEO of Richardson-Vicks Drugs; sister Priscilla Buckley, author of \"Living It Up with National Review: A Memoir\", for which William wrote the foreword; sister Patricia Buckley Bozell, who was Patricia Taylor's roommate at Vassar before each married; brother Reid Buckley, an author, debate-master, and founder of the Buckley School of Public Speaking; and brother James L. Buckley, who became a U.S. Senator from New York and was later a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.\nDuring the war, Buckley's family took in the future British historian Alistair Horne (son of Sir Allan Horne) as a child war evacuee. He and Buckley remained lifelong friends. They both attended the Millbrook School in Millbrook, New York, graduating in 1943. Buckley was a member of the American Boys' Club for the Defense of Errol Flynn (ABCDEF) during Flynn's trial for statutory rape in 1943. At Millbrook, Buckley founded and edited the school's yearbook, \"The Tamarack\"; this was his first experience in publishing. When Buckley was a young man, his father was an acquaintance of libertarian author Albert Jay Nock. William F. Buckley Sr., encouraged his son to read Nock's works.\nMusic.\nIn his youth, Buckley developed many musical talents. He played the harpsichord very well, later calling it \"the instrument I love beyond all others\", although he admitted he was not \"proficient enough to develop [his] own style\". He was close friends with harpsichordist Fernando Valenti, who offered to sell Buckley his sixteen-foot pitch harpsichord. Buckley was also an accomplished pianist and appeared once on Marian McPartland's National Public Radio show \"Piano Jazz\". A great admirer of Johann Sebastian Bach, Buckley wanted Bach's music played at his funeral.\nReligion.\nBuckley was raised a Catholic and was a member of the Knights of Malta. He described his faith by saying, \"I grew up, as reported, in a large family of Catholics without even a decent ration of tentativeness among the lot of us about our religious faith.\" When he attended Millbrook School, Buckley was permitted to attend Catholic Mass at a nearby church despite the school's Protestant affiliation. As a youth, he became aware of a perceived anti-Catholic bias in the United States through reading \"American Freedom and Catholic Power\", a Paul Blanshard book that accused American Catholics of having \"divided loyalties\".\nThe release of his first book, \"God and Man at Yale\", in 1951 was met with some specific criticism pertaining to his Catholicism. McGeorge Bundy, dean of Harvard at the time, wrote in \"The Atlantic\" that \"it seems strange for any Roman Catholic to undertake to speak for the Yale religious tradition\". Henry Sloane Coffin, a Yale trustee, accused Buckley's book of \"being distorted by his Roman Catholic point of view\" and stated that Buckley \"should have attended Fordham or some similar institution\".\nIn his 1997 book \"Nearer, My God\", Buckley condemned what he viewed as \"the Supreme Court's war against religion in the public school\" and argued that Christian faith was being replaced by \"another God\u00a0... multiculturalism\". As an adult, Buckley regularly attended the Tridentine Mass in Connecticut. He disapproved of the liturgical reforms following the Second Vatican Council. Buckley also revealed an interest in the writings and revelations of the 20th Century Italian writer Maria Valtorta. In his spiritual memoir, Buckley reproduced Valtorta's detailed accounts of Jesus Christ's crucifixion; these accounts were based on Valtorta's visionary experiences of Christ and the mystical revelations she recorded in her book \"The Poem of the Man-God\".\nMilitary service, higher education, and early career.\nBuckley attended the National Autonomous University of Mexico (or UNAM) in 1943. The following year, upon his graduation from the US Army Officer Candidate School (OCS), he was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the United States Army. In his book \"Miles Gone By\", he briefly recounts being a member of Franklin Roosevelt's honor guard upon Roosevelt's death. He served stateside throughout the war at Fort Benning, Georgia; Fort Gordon, Georgia; and Fort Sam Houston, Texas.\nAt the end of World War II in 1945, Buckley enrolled at Yale University, where he became a member of the secret Skull and Bones society and was a masterful debater. He was an active member of the Conservative Party of the Yale Political Union, and served as Chairman of the \"Yale Daily News\" and as an informer for the FBI. At Yale, Buckley studied political science, history, and economics and graduated with honors in 1950. He excelled on the Yale Debate Team; under the tutelage of Yale professor Rollin G. Osterweis, Buckley honed his acerbic style.\nBuckley remained at Yale working as a Spanish instructor from 1947 to 1951 before being recruited into the CIA like many other Ivy League alumni at that time; he served for two years, including one year in Mexico City working on political action for E. Howard Hunt, who was later jailed for his part in the Watergate affair. The two officers remained lifelong friends. In a November 1, 2005, column for \"National Review\", Buckley recounted that while he worked for the CIA, the only CIA employee he knew was Hunt, his immediate boss. While stationed in Mexico, Buckley edited \"The Road to Yenan\", a book by Peruvian author Eudocio Ravines. After leaving the CIA, he worked as an editor at \"The American Mercury\" in 1952, but left after perceiving newly emerging anti-Semitic tendencies in the magazine.\nMarriage and family.\nIn 1950, Buckley married Patricia Aldyen Austin (Pat) Taylor (1926\u20132007), daughter of Canadian industrialist Austin C. Taylor. He met Taylor, a Protestant from Vancouver, British Columbia, while she was a student at Vassar College. She later became a prominent fundraiser for such charitable organizations as the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center, and the Hospital for Special Surgery. She also raised money for Vietnam War veterans and AIDS patients. On April 15, 2007, Pat Buckley died at age 80 of an infection after a long illness. After her death, Buckley seemed \"dejected and rudderless\", according to friend Christopher Little.\nWilliam and Patricia Buckley had one son, author Christopher Buckley. They lived at Wallack's Point in Stamford, Connecticut, with a Manhattan duplex apartment at 73 East 73rd Street: a private entrance to 778 Park Avenue in Manhattan.\nBeginning in 1970, Buckley and his wife lived and worked in Rougemont, Switzerland for six to seven weeks per year for more than three decades.\nFirst books.\n\"God and Man at Yale\".\nBuckley's first book, \"God and Man at Yale\", was published in 1951. Offering a critique of Yale University, Buckley argued in the book that the school had strayed from its original mission. Critics viewed the work as miscasting the role of academic freedom. Buckley himself credited the attention the book received in the media to the \"Introduction\" written by John Chamberlain, saying that it \"chang[ed] the course of his life\" and that the famous \"Life\" magazine editorial writer had acted out of \"reckless generosity.\" Buckley was referred to in the novel \"The Manchurian Candidate\" by Richard Condon in 1959 as \"that fascinating younger fellow who had written about men and God at Yale.\"\n\"McCarthy and His Enemies\".\nIn 1954, Buckley and his brother-in-law L. Brent Bozell Jr. co-authored a book, \"McCarthy and His Enemies\". Bozell worked with Buckley at \"The American Mercury\" in the early 1950s when it was edited by William Bradford Huie. The book strongly defended Senator Joseph McCarthy as a patriotic crusader against communism. The book asserted that \"McCarthyism\u00a0... is a movement around which men of good will and stern morality can close ranks.\"\n\"National Review\".\nBuckley founded \"National Review\" in 1955 at a time when there were few publications devoted to conservative commentary. He served as the magazine's editor-in-chief until 1990. During that time, \"National Review\" became the standard-bearer of American conservatism, promoting the fusionism of traditional conservatives and libertarians. Examining postwar conservative intellectual history, Kim Phillips-Fein writes:\nBuckley sought out intellectuals who were ex-Communists or had once worked on the far Left, including Whittaker Chambers, Willi Schlamm, John Dos Passos, Frank Meyer and James Burnham, as editors and writers for \"National Review\". When Burnham became a senior editor, he urged the adoption of a more pragmatic editorial position that would extend the influence of the magazine toward the political center. Smant (1991) finds that Burnham overcame sometimes heated opposition from other members of the editorial board (including Meyer, Schlamm, William Rickenbacker, and the magazine's publisher, William A. Rusher), and had a significant impact on both the editorial policy of the magazine and on the thinking of Buckley himself.\nDefining the boundaries of conservatism.\nBuckley and his editors used \"National Review\" to define the boundaries of conservatism and to exclude people, ideas, or groups they considered unworthy of the conservative title. For example, Buckley denounced Ayn Rand, the John Birch Society, George Wallace, racists, white supremacists, and anti-Semites.\nWhen he first met author Ayn Rand, according to Buckley, she greeted him with the following: \"You are much too intelligent to believe in God.\" In turn, Buckley felt that \"Rand's style, as well as her message, clashed with the conservative ethos\". He decided that Rand's hostility to religion made her philosophy unacceptable to his understanding of conservatism. After 1957, he attempted to weed her out of the conservative movement by publishing Whittaker Chambers's highly negative review of Rand's \"Atlas Shrugged\". In 1964, he wrote of \"her desiccated philosophy's conclusive incompatibility with the conservative's emphasis on transcendence, intellectual and moral\", as well as \"the incongruity of tone, that hard, schematic, implacable, unyielding, dogmatism that is in itself intrinsically objectionable, whether it comes from the mouth of Ehrenburg, Savonarola\u2014or Ayn Rand.\" Other attacks on Rand were penned by Garry Wills and M. Stanton Evans. Nevertheless, Burns argues, her popularity and her influence on the right forced Buckley and his circle into a reconsideration of how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with all-out support for capitalism.\nDuring the 1950s, Buckley worked to remove anti-Semitism from the conservative movement and barred holders of those views from working for \"National Review\".\nIn 1962, Buckley denounced Robert W. Welch Jr. and the John Birch Society in \"National Review\" as \"far removed from common sense\" and urged the Republican Party to purge itself of Welch's influence.\nOn Robert Welch and the John Birch Society.\nIn 1952, their mutual publisher Henry Regnery introduced William F Buckley, Jr. to Robert Welch. Both Buckley and Welch became editors of political journals, and both had a knack for communication and organization. Welch launched his publication \"One Man's Opinion\" in 1956 (renamed \"American Opinion\" in 1958), one year after the founding of \"The National Review\". Welch twice donated $1,000 to Buckley's magazine, and Buckley offered to provide Welch \"a little publicity\" for his publication. Both believed that the United States suffered from diplomatic and military setbacks during the early years of the Cold War, and both were staunchly anti-communist. But Welch expressed doubts about Eisenhower's loyalties in 1957, and the two disagreed on the reasons for the United States' perceived failure in the Cold War's early years. According to Alvin Felzenberg's assessment, the disagreements between the two blossomed into \"a major battle\" in 1958. That year, Boris Pasternak won the Nobel Prize in Literature for his novel \"Doctor Zhivago.\" Buckley was impressed by the novel's vivid and depressing depictions of life in a communist society, and believed that the CIA's smuggling of the novel into the Soviet Union was an ideological victory. In September 1958, Buckley ran a review of \"Doctor Zhivago\" by John Chamberlain. In November 1958, Welch sent Buckley and other associates copies of his unpublished manuscript \"The Politician\", which accused Eisenhower and several of Eisenhower's appointees of involvement in a communist conspiracy. When Buckley returned the manuscript to Welch, he commented that the allegations were \"curiously\u2014almost pathetically optimistic.\" On December 9, 1958, Welch founded the John Birch Society with a group of business leaders in Indianapolis. By the end of 1958, Welch had both the organizational and the editorial infrastructure to launch his subsequent far-right political advocacy campaigns.\nIn 1961, reflecting on his correspondences with Welch and Birchers, Buckley told someone who subscribed to both the \"National Review\" and the John Birch Society: \"I have had more discussions about the John Birch Society in the past year than I have about the existence of God or the financial difficulties of \"National\" \"Review.\"\"\nViews on race and segregation.\nIn the 1950s and early 1960s, Buckley opposed federal civil rights legislation and expressed support for continued racial segregation in the South. In \"Freedom Is Not Enough: The Opening of the American Workplace\", author Nancy MacLean states that \"National Review\" made James J. Kilpatrick\u2014a prominent supporter of segregation in the South\u2014\"its voice on the civil rights movement and the Constitution, as Buckley and Kilpatrick united North and South in a shared vision for the nation that included upholding white supremacy\". In the August 24, 1957 issue of \"National Review\", Buckley's editorial \"Why the South Must Prevail\" spoke out explicitly in favor of temporary segregation in the South until \"long term equality could be achieved\". Buckley opined that temporary segregation in the South was necessary at the time because the black population lacked the education, economic, and cultural development to make racial equality possible. Buckley claimed that the white South had \"the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a genuine cultural equality between the races\". Buckley said white Southerners were \"entitled\" to disenfranchise black voters \"because, for the time being, it is the advanced race.\" Buckley characterized Blacks as distinctly ignorant: \"The great majority of the Negroes of the South who do not vote do not care to vote, and would not know for what to vote if they could.\" Two weeks after that editorial was published, another prominent conservative writer, L. Brent Bozell Jr. (Buckley's brother-in-law), wrote in the \"National Review\": \"This magazine has expressed views on the racial question that I consider dead wrong, and capable of doing great hurt to the promotion of conservative causes. There is a law involved, and a Constitution, and the editorial gives White Southerners leave to violate them both in order to keep the Negro politically impotent.\"\n\"Politico\" indicates that during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson, Buckley's writing grew more accommodating toward the civil rights movement. In his columns, he \"ridiculed practices designed to keep African Americans off the voter registration rolls\", \"condemned proprietors of commercial establishments who declined service to African Americans in violation of the recently enacted 1964 Civil Rights Act\", and showed \"little patience\" for \"Southern politicians who incited racial violence and race-baited in their campaigns\". But he disagreed with the concept of structural racism and placed a large amount of blame for lack of economic growth on the black community itself, most prominently during a highly publicized 1965 debate at the Cambridge Union with African-American writer James Baldwin, in which Baldwin carried the floor vote 544 to 164. In the late 1960s, Buckley disagreed with segregationist George Wallace of Alabama, debating against Wallace's segregationist platform on a January 1968 episode of \"Firing Line\".\nBuckley later said he wished \"National Review\" had been more supportive of civil rights legislation in the 1960s. He grew to admire Martin Luther King, Jr. and supported the creation of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. In 2004, Buckley told \"Time\", \"I once believed we could evolve our way up from Jim Crow. I was wrong. Federal intervention was necessary.\" The same year, he endeavored to clarify his earlier comments on race, saying: \"[T]he point I made about white cultural supremacy was sociological.\" Buckley also linked his usage of the word \"advancement\" to its usage in the name NAACP, saying that \"[the] call for the 'advancement' of colored people presupposes they are behind. Which they were, in 1958, by any standards of measurement.\"\nAnti-communism and support for military dictatorships.\nBuckley's opposition to communism extended to support for the overthrow and replacement of leftist governments by nondemocratic forces. Buckley supported Spanish authoritarian dictator General Francisco Franco, who led the rightist military rebellion in its military defeat of the Spanish Republic. He called Franco \"an authentic national hero\", applauding his overthrow of Spanish Republican \"visionaries, ideologues, Marxists and nihilists.\" He supported the military dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet, who led the 1973 coup that overthrew Chilean president Salvador Allende's democratically elected Marxist government; Buckley referred to Allende as \"a president who was defiling the Chilean constitution and waving proudly the banner of his friend and idol, Fidel Castro.\" In 2020, the \"Columbia Journalism Review\" uncovered documents that implicated Buckley in a media campaign by the Argentina military junta promoting the regime's image while covering up the Dirty War.\nBuckley rule.\nThe Buckley rule states that \"National Review\" \"will support the rightwardmost viable candidate\" for a given office. Buckley first stated the Buckley rule during the 1964 Republican primary election featuring Barry Goldwater and Nelson Rockefeller. The rule is often misquoted and misapplied as proclaiming support for \"the rightwardmost electable candidate\", or simply the most electable candidate.\nAccording to \"National Review\"s Neal B. Freeman, the Buckley rule meant that \"National Review\" would support \"somebody who saw the world as we did. Somebody who would bring credit to our cause. Somebody who, win or lose, would conservatize the Republican party and the country. It meant somebody like Barry Goldwater.\"\nPolitical commentary and action.\nBroadcasts and publications.\nBuckley's column \"On the Right\" was syndicated by Universal Press Syndicate beginning in 1962. From the early 1970s, his twice-weekly column was distributed regularly to more than 320 newspapers across the country. He authored 5,600 editions of the column, which totaled to over 4.5 million words.\nFor many Americans, Buckley's erudition on his weekly PBS show \"Firing Line\" (1966\u20131999) was their primary exposure to him and his manner of speech, often with vocabulary common in academia but unusual on television.\nThroughout his career as a media figure, Buckley had received much criticism\u2014largely from the American left, but also from certain factions on the right, such as the John Birch Society and its second president, Larry McDonald, as well as from Objectivists.\nIn 1953\u201354, long before he founded \"Firing Line\", Buckley was an occasional panelist on the conservative public affairs program \"Answers for Americans\" broadcast on ABC and based on material from the H. L. Hunt\u2013supported publication \"Facts Forum\".\nGoldwater and the Young Americans for Freedom.\nIn 1960, Buckley helped form Young Americans for Freedom (YAF). The YAF was guided by principles Buckley called \"The Sharon Statement\". Buckley was proud of the successful campaign of his older brother, Jim Buckley, on the Conservative Party ticket to capture the US Senate seat from New York State held by incumbent Republican Charles Goodell in 1970, giving very generous credit to the activist support of the New York State chapter of YAF. Buckley served one term in the Senate, then was defeated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1976.\nIn 1963\u201364, Buckley mobilized support for the candidacy of Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater, first for the Republican nomination against New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller and then for the Presidency. Buckley used \"National Review\" as a forum for mobilizing support for Goldwater.\nEdgar Smith murder case.\nIn 1962, Edgar Smith, who had been sentenced to death for the murder of 15-year-old high-school student Victoria Ann Zielinski, began a correspondence with Buckley from death row. As a result of the correspondence, Buckley began to doubt Smith's guilt. Buckley later said the case against Smith was \"inherently implausible\". An article by Buckley about the case, published in \"Esquire\" in November 1965, drew national media attention:\nBuckley's article brought renewed media interest in Hommell, who Smith claimed was the real killer. In 1971, there was a retrial. Smith took a plea deal, and was freed from prison that year. Buckley interviewed him on \"Firing Line\" soon thereafter.\nIn 1976, five years after being released from prison, Smith attempted to murder another woman in San Diego, California. After witnesses corroborated the story of Lisa Ozbun, who survived being stabbed by Smith, he was sentenced to life in prison. He admitted at the trial that he had in fact also murdered Zielinski. Buckley subsequently expressed great regret at having believed Smith and supported him.\nMayoral candidacy.\nIn 1965, Buckley ran for mayor of New York City as the candidate for the new Conservative Party. He ran to restore momentum to the conservative cause in the wake of Goldwater's defeat. He tried to take votes away from the relatively liberal Republican candidate and fellow Yale alumnus John Lindsay, who later became a Democrat. Buckley did not expect to win; when asked what he would do if he won the race, he responded, \"Demand a recount.\" He used an unusual campaign style. During one televised debate with Lindsay, Buckley declined to use his allotted rebuttal time and instead replied, \"I am satisfied to sit back and contemplate my own former eloquence.\"\nTo relieve traffic congestion, Buckley proposed charging drivers a fee to enter the central city and creating a network of bike lanes. He opposed a civilian review board for the New York Police Department, which Lindsay had recently introduced to control police corruption and install community policing. Buckley finished third with 13.4% of the vote, possibly having inadvertently aided Lindsay's election by instead taking votes from Democratic candidate Abe Beame.\nNixon administration.\nIn July 1971, Buckley assembled a group of conservatives to discuss some of Nixon's domestic and foreign policies that the group opposed. In August 1969, Nixon had proposed and later attempted to enact welfare legislation known as the Family Assistance Plan (FAP), which would establish a national income floor of $1,600 per year for a family of four. On the international front he negotiated arms talks with the Soviet Union and initiated relations with China, which Buckley, as a hawk and anti-communist, opposed. The group, known as the Manhattan Twelve, included National Review's publisher William A. Rusher and editors James Burnham and Frank Meyer. Other organizations represented were the newspaper \"Human Events\", The Conservative Book Club, Young Americans for Freedom, and the American Conservative Union. On July 28, 1971, they published a letter announcing that they would no longer support Nixon. The letter said, \"In consideration of his record, the undersigned, who have heretofore generally supported the Nixon Administration, have resolved to suspend our support of the Administration.\"\nNonetheless, in 1973, the Nixon Administration appointed Buckley to serve as a delegate to the United Nations, about which Buckley later wrote a book. In 1981, Buckley informed President-elect (and personal friend) Ronald Reagan that he would decline any official position offered to him. Reagan jokingly replied that was too bad, because he had wanted to make Buckley ambassador to (then Soviet-occupied) Afghanistan. Buckley replied that he was willing to take the job but only if he were to be supplied with \"10 divisions of bodyguards\".\nFeud with Gore Vidal.\nWhen asked if there was one person with whom Buckley would not share a stage, Buckley's response was Gore Vidal. Likewise, Vidal's antagonism toward Buckley was well known, even before 1968. Buckley nevertheless appeared in a series of televised debates with Vidal during the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami and the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.\nIn their penultimate debate on August 28 of that year, the two disagreed over the actions of the Chicago Police Department and the protesters at the convention. In reference to the response of the police involved in supposedly taking down a Viet Cong flag, moderator Howard K. Smith asked whether raising a Nazi flag during the Second World War would have elicited a similar response. Vidal responded that people were free to state their political views as they saw fit, whereupon Buckley interrupted and noted that people were free to speak their views but others were also free to ostracize them for holding those views, noting that in the US during the Second World War \"some people were pro-Nazi and they were well [i.e. correctly] treated by those who ostracized them\u2014and I'm for ostracizing people who egg on other people to shoot American Marines and American soldiers. I know you [Vidal] don't care because you have no sense of identification with\u2014\". Vidal then interjected that \"the only sort of pro- or crypto-Nazi I can think of is yourself\" whereupon Smith interjected, \"Now let's not call names\". Buckley, visibly angered, rose several inches from his seat and replied, \"Now listen, you queer, stop calling me a crypto-Nazi or I'll sock you in your goddamn face, and you'll stay plastered\".\nBuckley later apologized in print for having called Vidal a \"queer\" in a burst of anger rather than in a clinical context but also reiterated his distaste for Vidal as an \"evangelist for bisexuality\": \"The man who in his essays proclaims the normalcy of his affliction, and in his art the desirability of it, is not to be confused with the man who bears his sorrow quietly. The addict is to be pitied and even respected, not the pusher.\" The debates are chronicled in the 2015 documentary \"Best of Enemies\".\nThis feud continued the next year in \"Esquire\" magazine, which commissioned essays from Buckley and Vidal on the incident. Buckley's essay \"On Experiencing Gore Vidal\" was published in the August 1969 issue. In September, Vidal responded with his own essay, \"A Distasteful Encounter with William F. Buckley\". In it Vidal strongly implied that, in 1944, Buckley's unnamed siblings and possibly Buckley had vandalized a Protestant church in their Sharon, Connecticut, hometown after the pastor's wife sold a house to a Jewish family. He also implied that Buckley was homosexual and a \"racist, antiblack, anti-Semitic and a pro-crypto Nazi.\" Buckley sued Vidal and \"Esquire\" for libel; Vidal countersued Buckley for libel, citing Buckley's characterization of Vidal's novel \"Myra Breckenridge\" as pornography. After Buckley received an out-of-court settlement from \"Esquire\", he dropped the suit against Vidal. Both cases were dropped, with Buckley settling for court costs paid by \"Esquire\", which had published the piece, while Vidal, who did not sue the magazine, absorbed his own court costs. Neither paid the other compensation. Buckley also received an editorial apology from \"Esquire\" as part of the settlement.\nThe feud was reopened in 2003 when \"Esquire\" republished the original Vidal essay as part of a collection titled \"Esquire's Big Book of Great Writing\". After further litigation, \"Esquire\" agreed to pay $65,000 to Buckley and his attorneys, to destroy every remaining copy of the book that included Vidal's essay, to furnish Buckley's 1969 essay to anyone who asked for it, and to publish an open letter stating that \"Esquire\"'s current management was \"not aware of the history of this litigation and greatly [regretted] the re-publication of the libels\" in the 2003 collection.\nBuckley maintained a philosophical antipathy toward Vidal's other , Norman Mailer, calling him \"almost unique in his search for notoriety and absolutely unequalled in his co-existence with it.\" Meanwhile, Mailer called Buckley a \"second-rate intellect incapable of entertaining two serious thoughts in a row.\" After Mailer's 2007 death, Buckley wrote warmly about their personal acquaintance.\nAssociations with liberal politicians.\nBuckley became close friends with liberal Democratic activist Allard K. Lowenstein. He featured Lowenstein on numerous \"Firing Line\" programs, publicly endorsed his candidacies for Congress, and delivered a eulogy at his funeral.\nBuckley was also friends with economist John Kenneth Galbraith and former senator and presidential candidate George McGovern, both of whom he frequently featured or debated on \"Firing Line\" and college campuses. He and Galbraith were also popular for their occasional appearances on \"The Today Show\", where host Frank McGee would introduce them and then step aside and defer to their verbal thrusts and parries.\nAmnesty International.\nIn the late 1960s, Buckley joined the board of directors of Amnesty International USA. He resigned in January 1978 in protest over the organization's stance against capital punishment as expressed in its Stockholm Declaration of 1977, which he said would lead to the \"inevitable sectarianization of the amnesty movement\".\nViews on HIV/AIDS.\nIn a March 18, 1986, \"New York Times\" op-ed, Buckley addressed the AIDS epidemic. Calling it \"a fact\" that AIDS is \"the special curse of the homosexual\", he argued that people infected with HIV should marry only if they agreed to sterilization and that universal testing\u2014led by insurance companies, not the government\u2014should be mandatory. Most controversially of all, he wrote: \"Everyone detected with AIDS should be tattooed in the upper forearm, to protect common-needle users, and on the buttocks, to prevent the victimization of other homosexuals.\" The piece led to much criticism; some gay activists advocated boycotting Patricia Buckley's fund-raising efforts for AIDS. William Buckley later backtracked from the piece, but in 2004 he told \"The New York Times Magazine\": \"If the protocol had been accepted, many who caught the infection unguardedly would be alive. Probably over a million.\"\nSpy novelist.\nIn 1975, Buckley recounted being inspired to write a spy novel by Frederick Forsyth's \"The Day of the Jackal\": \"If I were to write a book of fiction, I'd like to have a whack at something of that nature.\" He went on to explain that he was determined to avoid the moral ambiguity of Graham Greene and John le Carr\u00e9. Buckley wrote the 1976 spy novel \"Saving the Queen\", featuring Blackford Oakes as a rule-bound CIA agent, based in part on his own CIA experiences. Over the next 30 years, he would write another ten novels featuring Oakes. \"New York Times\" critic Charlie Rubin wrote that the series \"at its best, evokes John O'Hara in its precise sense of place amid simmering class hierarchies\". \"Stained Glass\", second in the series, won a 1980 National Book Award in the one-year category \"Mystery (paperback)\".\nBuckley was particularly concerned about the view that what the CIA and the KGB were doing was morally equivalent. He wrote in his memoirs, \"To say that the CIA and the KGB engage in similar practices is the equivalent of saying that the man who pushes an old lady into the path of a hurtling bus is not to be distinguished from the man who pushes an old lady out of the path of a hurtling bus: on the grounds that, after all, in both cases someone is pushing old ladies around.\"\nBuckley began writing on computers in 1982, starting with a Zenith Z-89. According to his son, Buckley developed an almost fanatical loyalty to WordStar, installing it on every new PC he got despite its growing obsolescence over the years. Buckley used it to write his last novel, and when asked why he continued using something so outdated, he answered \"They say there's better software, but they also say there's better alphabets.\"\nLater career.\nIn 1988, Buckley helped defeat liberal Republican Senator Lowell Weicker in Connecticut. Buckley organized a committee to campaign against Weicker and endorsed his Democratic opponent, Connecticut Attorney General Joseph Lieberman.\nIn 1991, Buckley received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President George H. W. Bush. Upon turning 65 in 1990, he retired from the day-to-day running of the \"National Review\". He relinquished his controlling shares of \"National Review\" in June 2004 to a pre-selected board of trustees. The following month, he published the memoir \"Miles Gone By\". Buckley continued to write his syndicated newspaper column, as well as opinion pieces for \"National Review\" magazine and \"National Review Online\". He remained the ultimate source of authority at the magazine and also conducted lectures and gave interviews.\nViews on modern-day conservatism.\nBuckley criticized certain aspects of policy within the modern conservative movement. Of George W. Bush's presidency, he said, \"If you had a European prime minister who experienced what we've experienced it would be expected that he would retire or resign.\"\nRegarding the War in Iraq, Buckley stated, \"The reality of the situation is that missions abroad to effect regime change in countries without a bill of rights or democratic tradition are terribly arduous.\" He added: \"This isn't to say that the Iraq war is wrong, or that history will judge it to be wrong. But it is absolutely to say that conservatism implies a certain submission to reality; and this war has an unrealistic frank and is being conscripted by events.\" In a February 2006 column published at \"National Review Online\" and distributed by Universal Press Syndicate, Buckley stated unequivocally that, \"One cannot doubt that the American objective in Iraq has failed.\" Buckley also stated that \"it's important that we acknowledge in the inner councils of state that [the war] has failed, so that we should look for opportunities to cope with that failure.\"\nAccording to Jeffrey Hart, writing in \"The American Conservative\", Buckley had a \"tragic\" view of the Iraq war: he \"saw it as a disaster and thought that the conservative movement he had created had in effect committed intellectual suicide by failing to maintain critical distance from the Bush administration\u00a0... At the end of his life, Buckley believed the movement he made had destroyed itself by supporting the war in Iraq.\" Regarding the Iraq War troop surge of 2007, however, it was noted by the editors of \"National Review\" that: \"Buckley initially opposed the surge, but after seeing its early success believed it deserved more time to work.\"\nBuckley was an advocate for the legalization of marijuana and some other drug legalization as early as his 1965 candidacy for mayor of New York City. He wrote a pointed pro-marijuana-legalization piece for \"National Review\" in 2004 in which he called for conservatives to change their views on legalization, stating, \"We're not going to find someone running for president who advocates reform of those laws. What is required is a genuine [R]epublican groundswell. It is happening, but ever so gradually. Two of every five Americans\u00a0... believe 'the government should treat marijuana more or less the same way it treats alcohol: It should regulate it, control it, tax it, and make it illegal only for children. In his December 3, 2007 column, shortly after his wife's death, which he attributed, at least in part, to her smoking, Buckley seemed to advocate banning tobacco use in America.\nBuckley took a middle course on the issues of gay rights and sexual ethics: He strongly opposed gay marriage, but supported the legalization of homosexual relations. Buckley also wrote articles for \"Playboy\", despite criticizing the magazine and its philosophy.\nAbout neoconservatives, he said in 2004: \"I think those I know, which is most of them, are bright, informed and idealistic, but that they simply overrate the reach of U.S. power and influence.\"\nDeath and legacy.\nBuckley suffered from emphysema and diabetes in his later years. In a December 2007 column, he commented on the cause of his emphysema, citing his lifelong habit of smoking tobacco, despite endorsing a legal ban of it. On February 27, 2008, he died from a heart attack at his home in Stamford, Connecticut, at the age of 82. Initially, it was reported that he was found dead at his desk in his study, a converted garage; his son, Christopher Buckley, said, \"He died with his boots on, after a lifetime of riding pretty tall in the saddle.\" But in his 2009 book \"Losing Mum and Pup: A Memoir\", he admitted that this account was a slight embellishment on his part: while his father died in his study, he was found lying on the floor. Buckley was buried at the Saint Bernard Cemetery in Sharon, Connecticut, next to his wife, Patricia.\nNotable members of the Republican political establishment paying tribute to Buckley included President George W. Bush, former Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich, and former First Lady Nancy Reagan. Bush said of Buckley, \"[h]e influenced a lot of people, including me. He captured the imagination of a lot of people.\" Gingrich added, \"Bill Buckley became the indispensable intellectual advocate from whose energy, intelligence, wit, and enthusiasm the best of modern conservatism drew its inspiration and encouragement ... Buckley began what led to Senator Barry Goldwater and his \"Conscience of a Conservative\" that led to the seizing of power by the conservatives from the moderate establishment within the Republican Party. From that emerged Ronald Reagan.\" Reagan's widow, Nancy, commented, \"Ronnie valued Bill's counsel throughout his political life, and after Ronnie died, Bill and Pat were there for me in so many ways.\"\nVarious organizations have awards and honors named after Buckley. The Intercollegiate Studies Institute awards the William F. Buckley Award for Outstanding Campus Journalism.\nLanguage and idiolect.\nBuckley was well known for his command of language. He came late to formal instruction in English, not learning it until he was seven years old and having earlier learned Spanish and French. Michelle Tsai in \"Slate\" says that he spoke English with an idiosyncratic accent: something between an old-fashioned, upper-class Mid-Atlantic accent, and British Received Pronunciation, yet with a Southern drawl.\nRhetoric.\nEpstein (1972) argues that liberals were especially fascinated by Buckley, and often wanted to debate him, in part because his ideas resembled their own, for Buckley typically formulated his arguments in reaction to left-liberal opinion, rather than being founded on conservative principles that were alien to the liberals.\nAppel (1992) argues from rhetorical theory that Buckley's essays are often written in \"low\" burlesque in the manner of Samuel Butler's satirical poem \"Hudibras\". Considered as drama, such discourse features black-and-white disorder, a guilt-mongering logician, distorted clownish opponents, limited scapegoating, and a self-serving redemption.\nLee (2008) argues that Buckley introduced a new rhetorical style that conservatives often tried to emulate. The \"gladiatorial style\", as Lee calls it, is flashy and combative, filled with sound bites, and leads to an inflammatory drama. As conservatives encountered Buckley's arguments about government, liberalism and markets, the theatrical appeal of Buckley's gladiatorial style inspired conservative imitators, becoming one of the principal templates for conservative rhetoric."}
{"title": "Ramsey_Campbell", "label": "Writer", "text": "Ramsey Campbell (born 4 January 1946) is an English horror fiction writer, editor and critic who has been writing for well over fifty years. He is the author of over 30 novels and hundreds of short stories, many of them winners of literary awards. Three of his novels have been filmed.\nSince he first came to prominence in the mid-1960s, critics have cited Campbell as one of the leading writers in his field: T. E. D. Klein has written that \"Campbell reigns supreme in the field today\", and Robert Hadji has described him as \"perhaps the finest living exponent of the British weird fiction tradition\", while S. T. Joshi stated, \"future generations will regard him as the leading horror writer of our generation, every bit the equal of Lovecraft or Blackwood.\" In a 2021 appreciation of his collected works, The Washington Post said, \"[t]aken together, they constitute one of the monumental accomplishments of modern popular fiction.\"\nOverview.\nEarly life and work.\nCampbell was born in Liverpool, England, to Alexander Ramsey and Nora (Walker) Campbell. He was educated by Christian Brothers at St Edward's College, Liverpool. Campbell's childhood and adolescence were marked by the rift between his parents, who became estranged shortly after his birth. Campbell's father became a shadowy presence more often heard than seen. Campbell states, \"I didn't see my father face to face for nearly twenty years, and that was when he was dying.\" Years later, Campbell's mother degenerated into paranoia and schizophrenia, rendering his own life a living hell\u2014an experience he has discussed in detail in the introduction and afterword to the restored text of \"The Face That Must Die\". Other autobiographical pieces regarding Campbell's life are available in Section V, \"On Ramsey Campbell\" in his essay collection \"Ramsey Campbell, Probably: 30 Years of Essays and Articles\" (ed. S.T. Joshi), as well as in the novella \"The Enigma of the Flat Policeman\" (2020).\nCampbell's mother \"wrote a great deal, novel after novel, but was largely unpublished aside from a handful of short stories in writer's magazines.\" She encouraged her young son to send his writing off from an early age. Growing up in the blitzed landscape of post-war Liverpool, Campbell avidly consumed the work of Lovecraft, Ambrose Bierce, Franz Kafka and the cinema of film noir.\n\"Ghostly Tales\".\nCampbell's earliest tales, written when he was 11 years old (1957\u201358; under the influence of a magazine from Bolton, Lancashire, called \"Phantom\"), comprised a self-illustrated collection of sixteen stories and a poem he entitled \"Ghostly Tales\". Campbell intended to submit to \"Phantom\", but his mother, who regarded literary success as a possible way of financing her escape from her disastrous marriage, persuaded him to wait until he had a whole book to show to publishers. His English teacher, Brother Kelly, used to have him read his stories to the class. Campbell (as John R. Campbell) submitted \"Ghostly Tales\" to \"numerous publishers\" including Tom Boardman publisher; Boardman rejected it as they did not publish ghost stories, but his rejection letter included encouragement to Campbell to keep writing. This collection of juvenilia was published thirty years later, as a special issue of \"Crypt of Cthulhu\" magazine titled \"Ghostly Tales: Crypt of Cthulhu\" 6, No 8, whole number 50, Michaelmas 1987, edited by Robert M. Price. It is of interest that, though the stories are mostly mainstream spectral lore, one story (\"The Hollow in the Woods\") can be considered a very early mythos yarn.\nAnother issue of this magazine \"Crypt of Cthulhu\" No 43 (Hallowmas 1983), titled \"The Tomb-Herd and Others\" collects various early stories, including some early drafts of tales later published revised in Campbell's first book, \"The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants\" (Arkham House, 1964)). The manuscripts of Campbell's early tales are housed at the Local History Library of the Liverpool Public Libraries.\nThe influence of H. P. Lovecraft and \"The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants\".\nCampbell first encountered H. P. Lovecraft at age eight (1954), via the story \"The Colour Out of Space\", which he found in the Groff Conklin anthology \"Strange Travels in Science Fiction\", and within the next few years read \"The Rats in the Walls\" and \"The Dunwich Horror\", encountered in the Wise and Fraser anthology \"Great Tales of Terror and the Supernatural\". At the age of twelve, Campbell attempted to write a novel titled \"Broken Moon\", influenced by Arthur Machen, but it petered out after fifty pages. By the age of 14, he discovered Lovecraft's \"Cry Horror!\", a British edition of the collection entitled \"The Lurking Fear\", and read it in one day, finding the fiction's sense of awesomeness as well as horror extraordinarily appealing. He had also read Arthur Machen's major horror stories by this age, and some works by John Dickson Carr, which led him to write, at 14 years old, a 100-page Carr pastiche (unfinished) titled \"Murder By Moonlight\". This piece was published in 2020 as \"The Enigma of the Flat Policeman\", including annotations from the adult author reflecting on his psychological state at the time of composition. \nOn leaving school at age sixteen, Campbell went to work in the Inland Revenue as a tax officer (1962\u201366). Campbell sold various early stories to editors including August Derleth and Robert A.W. Lowndes. His concept of what was possible in the Weird genre became highly imbued with the influence of Lovecraft for the next few years. In December 1961, Campbell completed the story \"The Church in High Street\" (previously titled \"The Tomb-Herd\") which he sent to August Derleth at Arkham House, an imprint singlehandedly responsible for preserving the legacy of H P Lovecraft. Derleth accepted the story in February 1962 and it became Campbell's first professionally published tale, appearing in the Derleth-edited anthology \"Dark Mind, Dark Heart\". Campbell wrote various other tales of the Cthulhu Mythos between 1961 and 1963. Derleth gave the young writer invaluable advice on improving his writing style (their correspondence has been published in a single volume from PS Publishing).\nForming his literary apprenticeship with stories modelled after Lovecraft's themes, Campbell's first collection, \"The Inhabitant of the Lake and Less Welcome Tenants\" (Arkham House, 1964), published when he was but eighteen years old, collects his Lovecraftian pastiches to that date. Campbell has written, \"In 1964 I was several kinds of lucky to find a publisher, and one kind depended on my having written a Lovecraftian book for Arkham House, the only publisher likely even to have considered it and one of the very few then to be publishing horror.\" The title story of the collection introduces Campbell's invention of a tome of occult lore similar to Lovecraft's forbidden Necronomicon, \"The Revelations of Gla'aki\" (see Books of the Cthulhu Mythos).\nSevern Valley.\nThe Severn Valley is the setting of several fictional towns and other locations created by Campbell. Part of the Cthulhu Mythos started by Lovecraft, the fictional milieu is arguably the most detailed mythos setting outside of Lovecraft Country itself.\nIn his early writings, Campbell used the setting of Lovecraft's stories, in the fictional New England area of the Miskatonic River valley. At the suggestion of fellow Lovecraftian writer, August Derleth, he rewrote many of his earliest stories, which he had originally set in the Massachusetts locales of Arkham, Dunwich and Innsmouth, and moved them to English settings in and around the fictional Gloucestershire city of Brichester, near the River Severn, creating his own Severn Valley milieu for Lovecraftian horrors. The invented locale of Brichester is the main town of Campbell's Severn Valley, and was deeply influenced by Campbell's native Liverpool, and much of his later work is set in the real locales of Liverpool and the Merseyside area. The River Severn is an actual river in Wales and western England. Campbell's stories mention various real-world locales, including the Cotswold Hills, Berkeley, and the A38 road. These references place \"Campbell Country\" in the southern part of Gloucestershire, roughly between the cities of Gloucester and Bristol. This area is more correctly referred to as the Vale of Berkeley or the Severn Estuary; the real-world Severn Valley refers to an area around fifty miles (80\u00a0km) further north. His later work continued the focus on Liverpool; in particular, his 2005 novel \"Secret Stories\" (published in the U.S. in an abridged edition as \"Secret Story\" (2006)) both exemplifies and satirizes Liverpudlian speech, characters, humour and culture, while \"Creatures of the Pool\" draws on the city's geography and history.\nInclusions.\nSome of his stories about the fictional Severn Valley can be found found in the following anthologies and collections:\nInfluence.\nThe story \"Cold Print\" (1969) marked an end to Campbell's literary apprenticeship, taking the essence of Lovecraft out of the New England backwoods into a modern urban setting. Subsequently Campbell briefly disavowed Lovecraft, while working on the radically experimental tales which would be published as the collection \"Demons by Daylight\"; but he later acknowledged Lovecraft's lasting influence, and his subsequent Cthulhu Mythos tales, collected in \"Cold Print\" (1985; expanded in 1993), confirm the transition from pastiche to homage, most notably in such tales as \"The Faces at Pine Dunes\" and the eerily surreal \"The Voice on the Beach\" (1982). Later work still seeks to \"ascend the cosmic peaks achieved by Lovecraft\", particularly the novel \"The Darkest Part of the Woods\" (2003), the novella \"The Last Revelation of Gla'aki\" (2013), and three novels that form his Brichester Mythos trilogy (2016\u201318).\nThe 1970s: \"Determined to be myself\": \"Demons by Daylight\" and early novels.\nWith his stories written between 1964 and 1968, beginning with \"The Reshaping of Rossiter\" (first draft of \"The Scar\"), \"A Garden at Night\" (first draft of \"Made in Goatswood\") and \"The Successor\" (first draft of \"Cold Print\"), Campbell set out to be as unlike Lovecraft as possible. Having discovered writers such as Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Aickman, Graham Greene, Iris Murdoch, William Burroughs and Henry Miller, and such influences as the French 'new novel', he became interested in expanding the stylistic possibilities of his work. He finished the collection that would become \"Demons by Daylight\" in 1968, but it would not see print until 1973. Meanwhile, from 1969 to 1973, he continued to write short stories in which he gradually developed his own voice and themes and left the influence of Lovecraft far behind. Campbell worked in the Liverpool Public Libraries as a library assistant (1966\u201373) and was acting librarian in charge (1971\u201373).\nIn 1969, he had written \"Lovecraft in Retrospect\", a violent diatribe against Lovecraft, for the fanzine \"Shadow\", \"condemning [Lovecraft's] work outright.\" However, in his 1985 book \"Cold Print\", which collects his Lovecraftian stories, Campbell disavowed the opinions expressed in the article, stating: \"I believe Lovecraft is one of the most important writers in the field\" and \"the first book of Lovecraft's I read made me into a writer.\" Around 1970, Campbell stopped using his first initial \"J.\" on his work, though a few stories earlier than this appeared as by \"Ramsey Campbell\", and a few after still saw print as by \"J. Ramsey Campbell\". Campbell later legally changed his name to remove the \"John\".\nAfter working four years in the tax office and seven years in public libraries, by 1973, Campbell became a fulltime writer, encouraged by the issuance by Arkham House of his second collection, \"Demons by Daylight\" (as by Ramsey Campbell). That collection had been due for publication in 1971, but was held back two years by the death of August Derleth. \"Demons by Daylight\" includes \"The Franklyn Paragraphs\", which uses Lovecraft's documentary narrative technique without slipping into parody of his writing style. Other tales, such as \"The End of a Summer's Day\" and \"Concussion\", show the emergence of Campbell's highly distinctive mature style, of which S. T. Joshi has written:\nCertainly much of the power of his work derives purely from his prose style, one of the most fluid, dense and evocative in all modern literature [...] His eye for the details and resonances of even the most mundane objects, and his ability to express them crisply and almost prose-poetically, give to his work at once a clarity and a dreamlike nebulousness that is difficult to describe but easy to sense.\nThe book's appearance induced T. E. D. Klein to write an extensive and highly positive review, \"Ramsey Campbell: An Appreciation\" in \"Nyctalops\" magazine, and critic S. T. Joshi has stated that:\nits [...] allusiveness of narration; careful, at times even obsessive focusing on the fleeting sensations and psychological processes of characters; an aggressively modern setting that allows commentary on social, cultural and political issues\"\u2014\"all conjoin to make \"Demons by Daylight\" perhaps the most important book of horror fiction since Lovecraft's \"The Outsider and Others\".\nCampbell has written that \"Having completed \"Demons by Daylight\" in 1968, I felt directionless, and it shows in quite a few of the subsequent tales.\" He wrote only four tales in 1970, and five stories in 1971. He has written that \"retrospect demonstrates how untimely my decision [to write fulltime] was. Kirby McCauley, now my agent, had to tell me that the market for short horror stories was very limited ... My solution was to lurch into science fiction as best I could. Little of it sold...\" Many of the science fiction tales are collected in \"Inconsequential Tales\" (2008); he also wrote the novella \"Medusa\" (1973) and the short story \"Slow\" (collected in \"Told by the Dead\"), but has stated that his science fiction \"tried to deal with Themes, too consciously, I feel\".\nOutside the world of horror, he wrote a series of fantasy stories starring Ryre the Swordsman, who battles enemies on an alien world called Tond. Initially published in various anthologies, these stories were finally gathered in the collection \"Far Away &amp; Never\" (Necronomicon Press, July 1996). In 1976 he 'completed' three of Robert E. Howard's unfinished Solomon Kane stories, \"Hawk of Basti\", \"The Castle of the Devil\" and \"The Children of Asshur\" (published in 1978 and 1979). By the time Arkham House published his second hardcover collection of horror stories, \"The Height of the Scream\" (1976), he was beginning to be seen as one of the major modern writers of horror.\n1976 also saw the publication of Campbell's first novel, \"The Doll Who Ate His Mother\", which immediately drew acclaim from figures such as Fritz Leiber and T.E.D. Klein. In this and \"The Face that Must Die\" (1979), Campbell began to fully explore the enigma of evil, touching on the psychological themes of possession, madness and alienation which feature in many of his subsequent novels. He also continued to write short stories, mainly supernatural, receiving the World Fantasy Award for \"The Chimney\" (1977) and \"Mackintosh Willy\" (1980).\nCampbell has been a lifelong enthusiast of film; early stories such as \"The Reshaping of Rossiter\" (1964; an early version of \"The Scar\") show the influence of directors such as Alain Resnais, and as early as 1969 Campbell had become the film reviewer for BBC Radio Merseyside. He worked in Merseyside on the Friday edition of \"Breakfast\" and less frequently on Claire Hamilton's Sunday show. A longer version of his Merseyside reviews appeared on the Radio Merseyside website, where he also reviewed DVDs. His love of old movies features prominently in two of Campbell's later novels, \"Ancient Images\" and \"The Grin of the Dark\".\nCampbell wrote novelisations and introductions for a series of novelisations of Universal horror films. The series has a rather complex publishing history. They were published in paperback in 1977 in the US, with uniform packaging, by Berkley Medallion Books as \"The Universal Horror Library\". All six of the Berkley editions were published under the house name 'Carl Dreadstone'; all six of the US editions featured stills from the relevant films. It is believed this set was made available as boxed set in slipcase, as well as sold individually. Only three of the novels were actually written by Campbell, though he contributed introductions to all six volumes. No US hardcover edition of the series is known. Campbell's contributions to the series were \"Bride of Frankenstein\", \"Dracula's Daughter\" and \"The Wolfman\", published as Carl Dreadstone. Three further novelisations which appeared under this house name were not by Campbell but written by other authors. Walter Harris wrote two of the novels: \"Werewolf of London\" and \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". The author of the sixth Dreadstone (\"The Mummy\") remains unknown. UK editions followed\u2014in 1978, Universal Books (a paperback division of W. H. Allen Ltd) published \"The Bride of Frankenstein\" (by Campbell) together with Harris's \"The Werewolf of London\" and the (unknown author) \"The Mummy\" under the 'Carl Dreadstone' house name, with similar packaging under the title 'The Classic Library of Horror'. A further two years would elapse before the rest of the series was issued in the UK. The last three of the series were issued by Star Books (a W. H. Allen imprint) in 1980 (with different packaging from the 1978 titles) and these three appeared under a different house-name\u2014'E. K. Leyton'. These were Campbell's remaining two novels of the series, \"Dracula's Daughter\" and \"The Wolfman\", together with Harris's \"Creature from the Black Lagoon\". At least one hardcover omnibus was published, presumably prior to the UK paperbacks: \"The Classic Library of Horror Omnibus\u2014The Mummy &amp; The Werewolf of London\" (London: Allan Wingate, 1978). Its existence suggests there may have been two companion hardcover omnibuses collecting the balance of the series (if this were the case they would contain the Campbell-authored novels), but their existence/issuance is uncertain. All six of the UK paperbacks and the hardcover omnibus omitted the film stills which appeared in the original US editions.\n1979 saw the publication of the non-supernatural thriller \"The Face That Must Die\", the story of a homophobic serial killer told largely from the killer's point of view. Initially considered by numerous publishers, including Campbell's British publisher Thomas Tessier at Millington Books, as too grim to publish, it is regarded by many critics as one of Campbell's finest works. The novel was cut by Star Books, who first issued it in a paperback edition in 1979; it was not issued complete until the US Scream Press edition of 1983.\nThe 1980s: \"The Parasite\" to \"Ancient Images\".\nCampbell became even more prolific during the 1980s, issuing no less than eight novels (of which six won awards) and three short story collections. He has written that after moving away from Lovecraft's influence he was \"determined to sound like myself\" but also that \"The Chicago and San Francisco tales of Fritz Leiber were now my models in various ways. I wanted to achieve that sense of supernatural terror which derives from the everyday urban landscape rather than invading it, and I greatly admired\u2014still do\u2014how Fritz wrote thoroughly contemporary weird tales which were nevertheless rooted in the best traditions of the field, and which drew some of their strength from uniting British and American influences.\"\nIn 1981, Stephen King published a semi-autobiographical overview of the horror field, \"Danse Macabre.\" In a chapter focusing on 20th century practitioners, King devoted a section to Campbell's fiction, alongside that of Ray Bradbury, Shirley Jackson, Peter Straub, Richard Matheson, Jack Finney and others. On the basis of Campbell's earliest work, especially \"The Doll Who Ate His Mother\", King argued that the author's strength lies in his hallucinogenic prose and edgy psychology, the way his characters view the world and how this affects readers:\nIn a Campbell novel or story, one seems to view the world through the thin and shifting perceptual haze of an LSD trip that is just ending ... or just beginning. The polish of his writing and his mannered turns of phrase and image make him seem something like the genre's Joyce Carol Oates [...] as when journeying on LSD, there is something chilly and faintly schizophrenic in the way his characters see things ... and in the things they see [...] Good stuff. But strange; so uniquely Campbell that it might as well be trademarked.\nKing also singled out one of Campbell's early short stories for particular praise: \"The Companion' may be the best horror tale to be written in the English language in thirty years; it is surely one of the half a dozen or so which will still be in print and commonly read a hundred years from now.\" This story appeared in Campbell's 1982 collection, \"Dark Companions\", alongside other tales from that period commonly cited as early classics: \"The Chimney\", \"Mackintosh Willy\", and \"Call First\".\n\"The Parasite\" (1980; published in the US with a different ending as \"To Wake the Dead\") is an intense novel told from the point of view of a female protagonist who becomes embroiled in occult practices (with Lovecraftian undertones). In \"The Nameless\" (1981), also told from the point of view of a woman, a child goes missing and returns only years later, affiliated to a nefarious organisation. \"Obsession\" (1982) involves a group of childhood friends making a wish apiece concerning their futures, the manifestations tormenting them in later life; however, as is common in Campbell's work involving aberrant mental states, it is not entirely apparent that these events have a supernatural origin. In \"Incarnate\" (1983), the boundaries between dream and reality are gradually broken down as a group of characters involved in a psychological experiment begin to experience fragmentation in their everyday lives (the novel was written during the \"terrible nightmare year\" of Campbell's mother's last mental breakdown).\nIn \"The Claw\" (1983; originally published under the pseudonym Jay Ramsey) and \"The Hungry Moon\" (1986), Campbell writes more commercially than in earlier novels. The latter is a multi-character 'small town' horror story along the lines of similar work in this period, a subgenre arguably 'pump-primed' by the likes of Stephen King's \"'Salem's Lot\". In characteristically honest and self-critical afterwords, Campbell has claimed that \"The Hungry Moon,\" along with the similarly commercial \"The Parasite\" and, to a lesser degree, \"The Claw\", are among of his least successful of his works, by turns awkwardly structured, containing too many ideas, and/or tending towards explicit violence. By contrast, \"The Influence\" (1988) and \"Ancient Images\" (1989) are tightly plotted novels of supernatural menace, each with (predominantly) female central characters and generating unease through the author's trademark suggestiveness and surreal imagery. In 1987, Campbell published \"Scared Stiff\", a collection of \"sex and horror\" short stories.\nIn the early 1980s Campbell had crossed paths a number of time in Liverpool at cinemas and various parties with a young Liverpool writer named Clive Barker, who had been working around London as a playwright. Barker asked Campbell if he knew any markets for short stories and eventually asked him to look over a soon-to-be-published manuscript and the contract he had been offered for it. Campbell says \"My jaw dropped when I looked at the manuscript\u2014it turned out to be the \"Books of Blood\".\" Campbell wrote the introduction to the first edition.\nCampbell contributed numerous articles on horror cinema to \"The Penguin Encyclopedia of Horror and the Supernatural\" (1986).\nThe 1990s: \"Midnight Sun\" to \"The Last Voice They Hear\".\nThe 1990s again saw Campbell publish eight novels, though in the second half of this decade he moved away from traditional horror to explore crime and tales of social alienation. Four of this decade's novels won awards.\nIn \"Midnight Sun\" (1990), an alien entity apparently seeks entry to the world through the mind of a children's writer. In its fusion of horror with awe, \"Midnight Sun\" shows the influence of Algernon Blackwood and Arthur Machen as well as Lovecraft. Although the author considers this novel \"an honourable failure\", it is one that many enthusiasts single out as a highlight of this stage of his career. \"Needing Ghosts\" (1990), a novella, is a nightmarish work that blends the horrific and the comic; Campbell himself has described the composition of this piece as unique among his work in that it \"felt like dreaming on the page\" and was written relatively quickly without technical or structural challenges.\nA sympathetic serial murderer appears in the black comedy \"The Count of Eleven\" (1991), which displays Campbell's gift for word play, and which the author has said is disturbing \"because it doesn't stop being funny when you think it should\". A review at the time suggested that the central character might be played in a film by Stan Laurel, an observation that delighted Campbell, who is a great admirer of Laurel and Hardy. Other novels of this decade include \"The Long Lost\" (1993), in which a sin-eater is discovered by a couple holidaying in Wales and brought home ostensibly as an relative, with considerable impact on a community. A haunted house novel called \"The House on Nazareth Hill\" (1996), combining the author's M R Jamesian suggestiveness with an increasingly idiosyncratic prose style, is a study of familial psychology and the unchanging nature of social processes, particularly those relating to the young's quest for independence and the threat this presents to others.\nCampbell had earlier published a non-supernatural novel called \"The One Safe Place\" (1995), which uses a highly charged thriller narrative to examine social problems such as the deprivation and abuse of children, and in 1998 he turned away for a more sustained period from the supernatural work with which he was associated. By this time, horror had become commercially less successful and publishers were taking fewer chances on publishing such material, all of which encouraged Campbell to write a number of crimes novels. The first, \"The Last Voice They Hear\" (1998), is a tightly plotted thriller which ranges back and forth in time as two brothers become engaged in a cat-and-mouse game redolent of earlier events in their lives. Although written \"under protest\", Campbell came to think of the book, during composition, as bearing his own stamp, and his next two novels were also non-supernatural.\nIn this decade Campbell issued four short story collections, including, in 1993, the 30-year career retrospective \"\", published by Campbell's original publisher, Arkham House. This volume, illustrated by Jeff K. Potter, is not a comprehensive collection of all the stories Campbell had published in those thirty years, rather 39 tales which Campbell and his editor Jim Turner thought representative. Drawing on material across his career to that date, it is considered a good entry point for readers unfamiliar with his work. \"Waking Nightmares\" (1991), \"Strange Things and Stranger Places\" (1993), and \"Ghosts and Grisly Things\" (1998) collect much of Campbell's short fiction from this period. Two of this decade's short story collections won awards.\nIn 1999, Campbell was awarded both the Grand Master Award from the World Horror Convention and a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Horror Writers Association.\nThe 2000s: \"Silent Children\" to \"Creatures of the Pool\".\nIn the \"noughties\", Campbell continued his prolific output, publishing multiple novels, along with three short story collections. He reviewed films and DVDs weekly for BBC Radio Merseyside until 2007, and began to contribute a monthly film column, \"Ramsey's Ramblings\", for \"Video Watchdog\" magazine. In 2002, PS Publishing issued a collection of Campbell's essays on horror and other areas of interest: \"Ramsey Campbell, Probably\" (this volume was expanded to include further material in a 2014 reprint). The collection includes book reviews, film reviews, autobiographical writings and other nonfiction, along with reminiscences and appreciations of authors such as John Brunner, Bob Shaw and K. W. Jeter, and an extensive, negative critique of Shaun Hutson's \"Heathen\", parodying Hutson's style.\nFollowing the publication of two more crime novels\u2014\"Silent Children\" (2000), the story of an eccentric child killer; and \"Pact of the Fathers\" (2001), which draws on arcane religious practices\u2014Campbell returned to the supernatural and otherworldly. \"The Darkest Part of the Woods\" (2003) successfully evokes the cosmic terrors of H P Lovecraft and was the first of Campbell's work published by PS Publishing; the author would go on to enjoy a long-term relationship with the UK imprint, granting first print rights to most new work. Having spent a number of months working full-time in a Borders store, Campbell wrote \"The Overnight\" (2004), about bookshop staff trapped in their hellish workplace during an overnight shift. In \"Secret Stories\" (2005; abridged US edition, \"Secret Story\", 2006) Campbell returned to the crime genre with a blackly comic study of a serial killer whose written accounts of his crimes inadvertently win a fiction competition, resulting in further murders.\n\"The Grin of the Dark\" (2007) draws on Campbell's interest in the history of cinema, as a character seeks material relating to a silent film comedian by the name of Tubby Thackeray. The novel also explores the impact of the internet on human consciousness. The author, often critical of his own output, continues to cite this novel as one with which he remains pleased. \"Thieving Fear\" (2008) and \"The Creatures of the Pool\" (2009) use locations in and around the author's native Liverpool to eerie effect.\n\"Told by the Dead\" (2003) and \"Just Behind You\" (2009) collected Campbell's more recent short fiction, while \"Inconsequential Tales\" (2008), collecting a number of unpublished stories, documents his early evolution as a stylist. \nIn 2007, Campbell was awarded the Living Legend Award from the International Horror Guild.\nThe 2010: \"The Seven Days of Cain\" to the \"Brichester Mythos Trilogy\".\nAfter 2010, Campbell continued to publish at least a book a year, including a collection of letters from his early career between himself and his first mentor August Derleth (\"Letters to Arkham: The Letters of Ramsey Campbell and August Derleth, 1961-1971\", ed. S. T. Joshi, 2014) .\nBoth \"The Seven Days of Cain\" (2010) and \"Think Yourself Lucky\" (2014) explore use of the internet, as characters originally appearing online start to impact upon the real world with disconcerting effects. In 2010, Campbell was commissioned to write the novelisation of the movie \"Solomon Kane,\" which was based on the swords and sorcery stories of Robert E. Howard (some of which Campbell had completed in his early career)\".\" \"Ghosts Know\" (2011), one of the author's few latter-day non-supernatural excursions (on the surface, at least), explores the mendacity of stage mediums/psychics in the context of a missing person story; it also showcases a later development in the Campbell's work, social comedy and confusions inherent in everyday communication. \"The Kind Folk\" (2012) is a delicately written evocation of fairy folk, told in the modern day.\nIn 2013, \"Holes for Faces\", a further collection of short fiction appeared, gathering together his work from the 2000s. During the same period, PS Publishing issued two novellas by Campbell: \"The Last Revelation of Gla'aki\" (2013) and \"The Pretence\" (2013). A third novella appeared in 2016 entitled \"The Booking,\" from Dark Regions Press. These were the first novellas Campbell had written since 1990's \"Needing Ghosts\". 2015 saw the release of \"Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach\", one of Campbell's few novels set outside the UK; a family holiday on a Greek island involves communion with a familiar supernatural character from literature. Campbell's collection of playful limericks based on famous horror works of fiction appeared in 2016: \"Limericks of the Alarming and Phantasmal.\"\n\"The Searching Dead\" (2016) was the first novel in a trilogy of H P Lovecraft-influenced works which, like the novella \"The Last Revelation of Gla'aki,\" revisits themes from Campbell's early work. Described by the author as his \"Brichester Mythos trilogy,\" the three-book series, including \"Born to the Dark\" (2017) and \"The Way of the Worm\" (2018), documents a character's engagement with a nefarious organisation over three time periods (1950s, 1980s, 2010s) and evokes a cosmic entity by the name of Daoloth. The trilogy draws together multiple themes that have preoccupied the author during his whole career: the cosmic, family, scapegoating, the vulnerability of children, and the seductiveness of totalising belief systems.\nA new short story collection, \"By the Light of my Skull,\" was also released in 2018, gathering together some of Campbell's more recent works, some of which\u2014as has been the case in his later fiction\u2014deal with older age. \"Visions from Brichester\" (2017) collected all of the author's Lovecraftian short fiction not originally published in \"The Inhabitant of the Lake\". PS Publishing will issue a two-volume retrospective focused on Campbell's most representative short fiction across his entire career, the first of which is \"The Companion &amp; Other Phantasmagorical Stories\" (2019).\nIn 2015, Campbell received the World Fantasy Award's Life Award, and in 2017, in Spain, he was awarded the Premio Sheridan Le Fanu for his career achievements. In 2015, the author received an Honorary Fellowship from John Moores University, Liverpool, for \"outstanding services to literature\".\nThe 2020s: \"The Wise Friend\" to present.\n\"The Wise Friend\" was published in spring 2020 by new publisher Flame Tree Press (which has also reissued earlier Campbell novels in hardcover, paperback, ebook, and audiobook). Among the quietest of the author's work, this novel draws on folk horror as a father seeks to protect his son who has become involved with a legacy with occult overtones. A new novella, \"The Enigma of the Flat Policeman,\" part of Borderlands Press's Little Book series (in this case, \"A Little Green Book of Grins &amp; Gravity\"), was released in March, 2020. It consists of an incomplete short detective novel the author wrote aged 14 in imitation of John Dickson Carr, with annotations exploring the adult author's perceptions of his younger self's psychological state at the time of composition. The second volume of PS Publishing's career retrospective, \"The Retrospective &amp; Other Phantasmagorical Stories,\" was published in late 2020. Another Campbell career retrospective (with a different selection of tales) appeared in 2020 from Centipede Press as part of their \"Masters of the Weird Tale\" series, also issued in two volumes.\nIn July, 2021, Flame Tree Press released \"Somebody's Voice\", a non-supernatural thriller novel which focuses on themes of identity, memory, and mental disintegration; after an author ghost-writes a memoir, his grip on reality slides when the truth turns out to be less assured than he was led to believe. A third volume in PS Publishing's career retrospective series, \"Needing Ghosts &amp; Other Novellas\", was published in 2021; the book collects all of the author's novellas to date and includes a new novella, \"The Village Killings\". Also in 2021, a new edition of the author's sword and sorcery collection \"Far Away and Never\" was published (by DMR Books), including an extra story. In the same year, Dark Moon Books published a Campbell edition of their primer series (\"Exploring Dark Fiction\" \"#6: A Primer to Ramsey Campbell,\" which includes a new short story), while PS Publishing also released a revised edition of the author's collected essays, \"Ramsey Campbell, Certainly.\" \nCampbell has completed a new novel \"Fellstones\" (publication forthcoming) and is currently at work on another, \"The Lonely Lands\".\nStyle and themes.\nCampbell's style is characterised by an idiosyncratic use of language. His fictional worlds feel unusual, threatening, and dislocated. Such an approach prompted Peter Straub to write in a blurb for one of Campbell's early novels: \"Horrors in his fiction are never merely invented, they are felt and experienced, and affect the reader for days afterward.\" The horrors Campbell evokes are commonly suggested to the reader by ambiguous allusions to events his characters are not always mindful of. In this regard, his approach is similar to that of M. R. James. Indeed, Campbell celebrates James's concentrated prose, choice of detail, and ability to hint at disquieting material much larger than what is explicitly revealed. Campbell has described much of his own later work as \"comedies of paranoia\", as his characters experience an existential bewilderment that borders on the absurd.\nCampbell himself has cited the following themes as recurrent in his work: \"the vulnerability of children, the willingness of people to espouse a belief system that denies them the right to question, and the growing tendency to create scapegoats for the ills of the world.\" However, his work has addressed a wide range of issues, including censorship (e.g., \"The One Safe Place\", 1995), the impact of the internet on consciousness (e.g., \"The Grin of the Dark\", 2007; \"The Seven Days of Cain\", 2010; \"Think Yourself Lucky\", 2014), corporation-led consumerism (the recurrence of a global organisation called Frugo in his later work, especially \"The Overnight\", 2004, and \"Thieving Fear\", 2008), fatherhood (\"The House on Nazareth Hill\", 1996), and older age (\"Thirteen Days by Sunset Beach\", 2015). Abnormal human psychology is also a major recurring theme in Campbell's work (e.g., \"The Face That Must Die\", 1979; \"The Count of Eleven\", 1991; \"The Last Voice They Hear\", 1998; \"Secret Stories\", 2005; \"Somebody's Voice\", 2021).\nTributes.\nFour tribute anthologies of stories inspired by Campbell's work have been released to date. The first was the 1995 anthology \"Made in Goatswood\" (Chaosium, edited by Scott David Aniolowski), which includes a story by Campbell himself. More recently, \"The Children of Gla'aki\" (2016, Dark Regions Press, edited by Brian M. Sammons and Glynn Owen Barrass) consists of stories focused on one of Campbell's Lovecraftian creations, and \"Darker Companions\" (2017, PS Publishing, edited by Joe Pulver and Scott David Aniolowski) contains tales inspired by the author's vision and prose. In Spain, a further tribute anthology recently appeared entitled \"El Horror Que Vino del Sur: Un Tributo Latino a Ramsey Campbell Y Al Circulo de Lovecraft\" (2018, Bookbaby). All four books demonstrate Campbell's influence in the field on both established and newer writers. In 2021, \"Phantasmagoria\" magazine published a special edition (#4) devoted to Campbell\"s work, boasting many critiques and tributes from his peers. \nIn 2012, Campbell attracted a spoof collection of horror stories edited by fellow writer Rhys Hughes. Hughes contributed a good deal of the fictional content, including the pieces focused on an author called Lamblake Heinz, clearly a parody of Campbell (although Hughes has admitted elsewhere that he has read little if any of Campbell's work).\nFilms.\nThree of Campbell's novels have been filmed to date, all in Spain. Jaume Balaguer\u00f3's \"The Nameless\" (in Spanish \"Los Sin Nombre\"; in Catalan \"Els sense nom\"), based on the novel of the same name, takes some liberties with the source material's plot but captures its pungent atmosphere. Paco Plaza's \"Second Name\" (\"El Segundo Nombre\" in Spanish) based on the novel \"The Pact of the Fathers\", similarly evokes Campbell's paranoiac fictional world, its story rooted in the world of arcane religious practices. Denis Rovira van Boekholt's \"The Influence\" (\"La Influencia\" in Spanish), based on the Campbell novel of the same name and quite faithful (except for changes in the final third), was released in 2019 and was later picked up by Netflix to stream. It was recently announced that a TV series based on \"The Nameless\" is in development under the stewardship of Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Pau Freixas.\nBooks edited.\nCampbell has edited a number of anthologies, including \"New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos\" (1980); \"New Terrors\" and \"New Terrors II\", a groundbreaking two-volume anthology series; and (with Stephen Jones) the first five volumes of the annual \"Best New Horror\" series (1990\u20131994). His 1992 anthology \"Uncanny Banquet\" was notable for including the first ever reprint of the obscure 1914 horror novel \"The Hole of the Pit\" by Adrian Ross. \"The Gruesome Book\" was a paperback anthology of horror tales for children. Campbell is extremely well-read in the horror field, and some of his own literary influences are demonstrated by his selections for the 1988 anthology \"Fine Frights: Stories That Scared Me\". In 2002 he edited a collection of fiction in the tradition of M. R. James, entitled \"Meddling with Ghosts\". His 2003 anthology \"Gathering the Bones\" (co-edited with Dennis Etchison and Jack Dann) draws together tales from the UK, US, and Australia. \"The Folio Book of Horror Stories\" (2018), the first collection Campbell had edited in 15 years, draws together classic tales from the last 200 years.\nPersonal life.\nCampbell married Jenny Chandler, daughter of A. Bertram Chandler, on 1 January 1971. He commonly describes his wife as the \"best part\" of himself. At various stages of his career\u2014for instance, when he first decided to write on a full-time basis\u2014he received support from Jenny, who worked as a teacher. They have two children, Tamsin (born 1978) and Matthew (born 1981). Campbell is a life-long resident of Merseyside. He is fond of fine dining, travel, and classical music. He is very active as a public speaker and greatly enjoys giving readings of his fiction at literary events. Campbell is eloquent and jolly (a persona he self-effacingly describes as a \"facade\"), and he has claimed that if he hadn't become a horror writer, he might have been a stand-up comedian.\nIn response to an interview question about religion, Campbell has stated, \"As I got older I\u2019m more Agnostic [...] [a] little religious perspective is no bad thing; I have no set belief.\" He added, \"I don\u2019t think there is any supernatural force out there to make you do stuff.\" When asked whether he believes in the supernatural he claims to have experienced episodes that might be described as involving such activity; however, he remains noncommittal on this issue, stating that he writes about such material because he finds it \"imaginatively appealing\" and to \"repay\" the genre for many treasured reading experiences. Campbell is fiercely opposed to censorship, claiming that the suppression of contentious material can result in it returning in an even worse form. He has been very generous in support of newer writers, frequently writing introductions to their work.\nFor many years Campbell was the President of the British Fantasy Society."}
{"title": "Sponge_cake", "label": "Food", "text": "Sponge cake is a light cake made with egg whites, flour and sugar, sometimes leavened with baking powder. Sponge cakes, leavened with beaten eggs, originated during the Renaissance, possibly in Spain. The sponge cake is thought to be one of the first of the non-yeasted cakes, and the earliest attested sponge cake recipe in English is found in a book by the English poet Gervase Markham, \"The English Huswife, Containing the Inward and Outward Virtues Which Ought to Be in a Complete Woman\" (1615). Still, the cake was much more like a cracker: thin and crispy. Sponge cakes became the cake recognized today when bakers started using beaten eggs as a rising agent in the mid-18th century. The Victorian creation of baking powder by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843 allowed the addition of butter to the traditional sponge recipe, resulting in the creation of the Victoria sponge.\nHistory.\nBackground.\nThe earliest known recipe for sponge cake (or biscuit bread) from Gervase Markham's \"The English Huswife\" (1615) is prepared by mixing flour and sugar into eggs, then seasoning with anise and coriander seeds. Nineteenth century descriptions of \"avral bread\" (funeral biscuits) vary from place to place but it sometimes described as \"sponge biscuits\" or a \"crisp sponge\" with a light dusting of sugar \". Traditional American sponge recipes diverged from earlier methods of preparation, adding ingredients like vinegar, baking powder, hot water or milk. \nThe basic recipe is also used for madeleines, ladyfingers, and trifles, as well as some versions of strawberry shortcake.\nAlthough sponge cake is usually made without butter, its flavor is often enhanced with buttercream, pastry cream or other types of fillings and frostings. Sponge soaks up flavors from fresh fruits, fillings and custard sauces. Sponge cake covered in boiled icing was very popular in American cuisine during the 1920s and 1930s. The delicate texture of sponge and angel food cakes, and the difficulty of their preparation, meant these cakes were more expensive than daily staple pies. The historic Frances Virginia Tea Room in Atlanta served sponge cake with lemon filling and boiled icing. New York City's Crumperie served not only crumpets but toasted sponge cake as well.\nMethods of preparation.\nThe basic whisked sponge cake does not contain any fat. It is made by whisking egg whites and caster sugar and gently folding in flour. The process of whisking egg whites incorporates air bubbles to create a foam by agitating the protein albumen to create a partially coagulated membrane, making the egg whites stiffer and increasing their volume. This type of cake, also called foam cake, depends on aeration of eggs and heat to rise. Some types of sponge are baked in ungreased pans to improve the cake's rise by allowing the batter to adhere and climb the sides of the pan. To maintain the moisture of the cake it is sometimes made with potato flour.\nVariations on the basic sponge sometimes add butter or egg yolks to make the cake more moist. For Genoise cake flour and melted butter are added to the egg mixture for a moister cake. The \"biscuit\" sponge from early American cuisine is made by beating egg yolks with sugar, then alternately folding in whisked egg whites and flour. Anne Willan says both types of sponge cake are represented in French cuisine. According to Willan \"sponge may have some butter added, but not much or it will not rise\". Cream of tartar or baking soda are recommended by some turn of the century cookbooks to make Swiss rolls more pliable and easier to roll.\nFor some cakes, like the Victoria Sponge, fat and sugar are creamed before eggs and flour are incorporated into the batter, similar to pound cake. In British English layer cakes like the Victoria Sponge are called \"sandwich sponge\". This type of buttery cake was not possible without baking powder, which was discovered by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird in 1843, allowing the sponge to rise higher.\nTypes.\nAsian.\nIn the Philippines, sponge cakes and chiffon cakes were introduced during the Spanish period. They are known collectively as \"mam\u00f3n\". They are typically baked as cupcakes (\"torta\"), as loaves (\"taisan\"), or as cake rolls (\"pianono\"). Traditionally they are simply served with just butter (or margarine) and white sugar. Variants of \"mam\u00f3n\" also use unique ingredients, the most common being purple yam and pandan leaves which result in the ube cake and the buko pandan cake. Crispy cookie-like versions are known as \"mam\u00f3n tostado\" and \"broas\".\nSteamed sponge cake like the \"ma lai gao\" are commonly found in Malaysia. Chinese almond sponge is steamed and topped with boiled icing, chocolate, vegetables or fresh fruit. Korean sponge called \"saeng\" is usually made with rice flour and topped with whipped topping and fruit. Some Vietnamese varieties may have fresh herbs like mint, lemon grass or basil added to the batter, and be topped with caramelized tropical fruit. Milk and jaggery are added to sponge cake in India which is served with the creamy Sri Lankan specialty \"avocado crazy\". Western style sponge cakes topped with whipped cream and strawberries are popular in Japan where sponge is also used as a base for cheesecakes.\nAngel food cake.\nAngel food cake is a 19th-century American cake that contains no egg yolks or butter. The cake is leavened using only egg whites and baking powder. This recipe can be traced to 18th century American cookbooks. The delicate cake is baked in an ungreased pan and cooled upside down.\nBoston cream pie.\nThe official state dessert of Massachusetts, the Boston cream pie, is a chocolate-glazed, layered yellow sponge cake filled with pastry cream. It may be based on the Washington pie, originally two layers of yellow sponge cake with jam filling and a dusting of icing sugar. The first known written recipe from the 1878 \"Granite Iron Ware Cook Book\" uses baking powder for the sponge. Maria Parloa published several recipes for cream pie, includes one for chocolate cream pie. Parloa's recipe is the closest to the modern Boston Cream Pie.\nChiffon cake.\nChiffon cake is a light and moist cake made with vegetable oil. It is similar to angel food cake and was commonly served with grapefruit at the Brown Derby in Hollywood during the 1930s.\nGenoise cake.\nThe addition of butter by French pastry cooks created a cake texture that more resembled pound cake than traditional sponge cake. Techniques were developed to make the cake lighter, including beating the eggs over heat, or beating the egg yolks and whites separately.\nPan di Spagna.\nThe \"Pan di Spagna\" evolved from the \"Genoise cake\" as an attempt to simplify the original recipe (the preparation doesn't use heat or molten butter).\nJoconde cake.\nA relative of the G\u00e9noise, the Joconde sponge cake (or \"Biscuit Joconde\") is a thin sponge cake made with ground almonds. It can be used as a layer in a layer cake (for example an opera cake), or for decorative purposes as \"Joconde imprime\".\nP\u00e3o-de-L\u00f3.\nThis sponge variation from Portuguese cuisine is flavoured with lemon or orange peel. It is served plain, and day-old cake may be incorporated into other desserts like puddings. The \"p\u00e3o-de-L\u00f3 de Alfeizer\u00e3o\" is lightly baked to a pudding like consistency, much like the p\u00e3o-de-L\u00f3 de Ovar, and flavored with brandy. Anecdotal legends about the cakes origin associate it with a secret recipe passed down by nuns to the village of Alfeizer\u00e3o. The manufacture for commercial markets began during the Portuguese Revolution of 1910. The \"P\u00e3o-de-L\u00f3\" evolved from the old French \"pain de lof\", which in turn was a Dutch borrowing from \"loef\". All variants \"loef\", \"lof\", \"l\u00f3\" refer to a nautical sail or cloth's side where the wind blows. The French adopted the Italian \"Genovese\" version of the cake and called it \"g\u00e9noise\". In Italy the cake was known as \"pan di spagna\". Also in France and Portugal the same equivalent terms were used around the 16th century, respectively \"pain d'Espagne\" and \"p\u00e3o de Hespanha/p\u00e3o de Castella\". Introduced to Japan by Portuguese traders in the 16th century, the Japanese variations on the cake are known as \"castella\", \"kasutera\" or simply \"pan\".\nPlava.\n\"Plava\" is a sponge cake that is found in Jewish cuisine and usually eaten during \"Pesach\". The batter is leavened with egg whites and frequently includes flavorings like lemon zest or almond essence.\nSwiss roll.\nA swiss roll is a thin sponge cake that is spread with a layer of filling and rolled.\nTipsy cake.\nIsabella Beeton included a recipe for her version of \"Tipsy Cake\" in \"Mrs Beeton's Book of Household Management\" where the cake was baked in a decorative mold before it was soaked in sherry and brandy with custard poured over, or broken into smaller pieces and topped with whipped cream like trifle.\nTrifle.\nThe earliest known form of trifle was a simple thickened cream flavored with sugar, rosewater and ginger but recipes for egg-thickened custard poured over sponge fingers, almond macaroons and sack-soaked ratafia biscuits are known from the mid-18th century. In 1747 Hannah Glasse adds syllabub and currant jelly over the custard. Similar recipes are known for the same time with the sponge soaked in sherry, wine or fruit juice. Eliza Acton's recipe for \"Duke's Custard\" was made from custard poured over brandied cherries rolled in sugar with sponge fingers (or macaroons) and pink whipped cream. Wyvern complained that trifle \"should be made to time-honored standards, and not debased into a horror of stale cake, mean jam, canned fruits, packet jelly and packet custard.\"\nVictoria sponge.\nThe Victoria sponge, also known as the Victoria sandwich cake, was named after Queen Victoria, who was known to enjoy the small cakes with her afternoon tea. The version Queen Victoria ate would have been filled with jam alone, but modern versions often include cream. The top of the cake is not iced or decorated apart from a dusting of caster sugar. The recipe evolved from the classic pound cake made with equal proportions of flour, fat, sugar and eggs. The invention of baking powder in 1843 by English food manufacturer Alfred Bird allowed the cake to rise higher than was previously possible. Cookery author Felicity Cloake writes that this invention \"was celebrated with a patriotic cake\"\u2014the Victoria sponge. According to Alysa Levene of Oxford Brookes University the term \"sponge\" is used \"erroneously\" for the Victoria Sandwich cake:\nThe pound cake became popular in Britain in the eighteenth century as cake moved away from its heavy, fruity incarnations toward something lighter and more golden, eventually becoming the iconic Victoria sandwich cake (also known \u2013 erroneously \u2013 as a Victoria sponge)\nA Victoria sponge is made using one of two methods. The traditional method involves creaming caster sugar with fat (usually butter), mixing thoroughly with beaten egg, then folding flour and raising agent into the mixture. The modern method, using an electric mixer or food processor, involves simply whisking all the ingredients together until creamy. Additionally, the modern method typically uses an extra raising agent, and some recipes call for an extra-soft butter or margarine.\nThis basic \"cake\" mixture has been made into a wide variety of treats and puddings, including cupcakes, chocolate cake, and Eve's pudding.\nReligious celebrations.\nAt Passover.\nSince sponge cakes are not leavened with yeast, they are popular dessert choices for the Passover feast. Typically, Passover sponges are made with matzo meal, shredded coconut, matzo flour, potato flour, or nut flour (almond, hazelnut etc.) since raw wheat products may not be used. No raising agent may be used due to the strict prohibition of even the appearance of a leavening effect. Therefore, the beating of egg whites in the mix to achieve the aeration is an essential characteristic of any Passover sponge recipe. Many families have at least one recipe they pass down through generations, and matzo meal-based cake mixes are available commercially. Several brands are easily found in kosher stores, especially before Passover. Typical flavorings include almonds, apples, dark chocolate, lemon, pecans, and poppy seeds. Apple or orange juice is the liquid ingredient. Milk is avoided, because it cannot be included in a dessert to be served after a meat based meal. The sponge, or a heavier variant in the form of an almond pudding, may be included as an element of the dessert in the Passover meal during the Seder service, when it is often combined in serving with a fruit compote.\nOn Christmas.\nThe Yule log is a Christmas dessert made from a sheet of sponge cake spread with filling and rolled up. It is topped with chocolate to give the appearance of bark. Decorative elements like mushrooms made of meringue, spun-sugar spiderwebs or crushed pistachios can be added to enhance the cake's finished appearance."}
{"title": "Pizza", "label": "Food", "text": "Pizza (, ) is a dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven. A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.\nIn Italy, pizza served in a restaurant is presented unsliced, and is eaten with the use of a knife and fork. In casual settings, however, it is cut into wedges to be eaten while held in the hand.\nThe term \"pizza\" was first recorded in the 10th century in a Latin manuscript from the Southern Italian town of Gaeta in Lazio, on the border with Campania. Modern pizza was invented in Naples, and the dish and its variants have since become popular in many countries. It has become one of the most popular foods in the world and a common fast food item in Europe, North America and Australasia; available at pizzerias (restaurants specializing in pizza), restaurants offering Mediterranean cuisine, via pizza delivery, and as street food. Various food companies sell ready-baked pizzas, which may be frozen, in grocery stores, to be reheated in a home oven.\nIn 2017, the world pizza market was US$128 billion, and in the US it was $44 billion spread over 76,000 pizzerias. Overall, 13% of the U.S. population aged 2 years and over consumed pizza on any given day.\nThe \"Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana\" (lit. True Neapolitan Pizza Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1984 with headquarters in Naples that aims to promote traditional Neapolitan pizza. In 2009, upon Italy's request, Neapolitan pizza was registered with the European Union as a Traditional Speciality Guaranteed dish, and in 2017 the art of its making was included on UNESCO's list of intangible cultural heritage.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"pizza\" first appeared in a Latin text from the town of Gaeta, then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta \"duodecim pizze\" (\"twelve pizzas\") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter Sunday.\nSuggested etymologies include:\nHistory.\nFoods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age. Records of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle shields and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils, herbs, and cheese. An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs in the \"Aeneid\", when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When they eat the bread, they realize that these are the \"tables\" prophesied by Celaeno.\nThe first mention of the word \"pizza\" comes from a notarial document written in Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a payment of \"twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day.\"\nModern pizza evolved from similar flatbread dishes in Naples, Italy, in the 18th or early 19th century. Prior to that time, flatbread was often topped with ingredients such as garlic, salt, lard, and cheese. It is uncertain when tomatoes were first added and there are many conflicting claims. Until about 1830, pizza was sold from open-air stands and out of pizza bakeries.\nA popular contemporary legend holds that the archetypal pizza, \"pizza Margherita\", was invented in 1889, when the Royal Palace of Capodimonte commissioned the Neapolitan pizzaiolo (pizza maker) Raffaele Esposito to create a pizza in honor of the visiting Queen Margherita. Of the three different pizzas he created, the Queen strongly preferred a pizza swathed in the colors of the Italian flag\u00a0\u2014 red (tomato), green (basil), and white (mozzarella). Supposedly, this kind of pizza was then named after the Queen, although later research cast doubt on this legend. An official letter of recognition from the Queen's \"head of service\" remains on display in Esposito's shop, now called the Pizzeria Brandi.\nPizza was brought to the United States by Italian immigrants in the late nineteenth century and first appeared in areas where they concentrated. The country's first pizzeria, Lombardi's, opened in New York City in 1905. Following World War II, veterans returning from the Italian Campaign, who were introduced to Italy's native cuisine, proved a ready market for pizza in particular.\nPreparation.\nPizza is sold fresh or frozen, and whole or in portion-size slices. Methods have been developed to overcome challenges such as preventing the sauce from combining with the dough, and producing a crust that can be frozen and reheated without becoming rigid. There are frozen pizzas with raw ingredients and self-rising crusts.\nAnother form of pizza is available from take and bake pizzerias. This pizza is assembled in the store, then sold unbaked to customers to bake in their own ovens. Some grocery stores sell fresh dough along with sauce and basic ingredients, to assemble at home before baking in an oven.\nBaking.\nIn restaurants, pizza can be baked in an oven with fire bricks above the heat source, an electric deck oven, a conveyor belt oven, or, in traditional style in a wood or coal-fired brick oven. The pie is slid into the oven on a long paddle, called a peel, and baked directly on hot bricks, a screen (a round metal grate, typically aluminum), or whatever the oven surface is. Prior to use, a peel is typically sprinkled with cornmeal to allow the pizza to easily slide on and off it. When made at home, a pizza can be baked on a pizza stone in a regular oven to reproduce some of the heating effect of a brick oven. Cooking directly on a metal surface results in too rapid heat transfer to the crust, burning it. Some home chefs use a wood-fired pizza oven, usually installed outdoors. As in restaurants, these are often dome-shaped, as pizza ovens have been for centuries, in order to achieve even heat distribution. Another variation is grilled pizza, in which the pizza is baked directly on a barbecue grill. Greek pizza, like deep dish Chicago and Sicilian style pizza, is baked in a pan rather than directly on the bricks of the pizza oven.\nMost restaurants use standard and purpose-built pizza preparation tables to assemble their pizzas. Mass production of pizza by chains can be completely automated. \nCrust.\nThe bottom of the pizza, called the \"crust\", may vary widely according to style \u2013 thin as in a typical hand-tossed Neapolitan pizza or thick as in a deep-dish Chicago-style. It is traditionally plain, but may also be seasoned with garlic or herbs, or stuffed with cheese. The outer edge of the pizza is sometimes referred to as the \"cornicione\". Some pizza dough contains sugar, to help its yeast rise and enhance browning of the crust.\nDipping sauce specifically for pizza was invented by American pizza chain Papa John's Pizza in 1984 and has since been adopted by some when eating pizza, especially the crust.\nCheese.\nMozzarella cheese is commonly used on pizza, with the buffalo mozzarella produced in the surroundings of Naples. Other cheeses are also used, particularly Italian cheeses including provolone, pecorino romano, ricotta, and scamorza. Less expensive processed cheeses or cheese analogues have been developed for mass-market pizzas to produce desirable qualities like browning, melting, stretchiness, consistent fat and moisture content, and stable shelf life. This quest to create the ideal and economical pizza cheese has involved many studies and experiments analyzing the impact of vegetable oil, manufacturing and culture processes, denatured whey proteins, and other changes in manufacture. In 1997, it was estimated that annual production of pizza cheese was in the U.S. and in Europe.\nVarieties and styles.\nLists.\nA great number of pizza varieties exist, defined by the choice of toppings and sometimes also crust. There are also several styles of pizza, defined by their preparation method. The following lists feature only the notable ones.\nBy region of origin.\nItaly.\nAuthentic Neapolitan pizza (\"pizza napoletana\") is made with San Marzano tomatoes, grown on the volcanic plains south of Mount Vesuvius, and mozzarella di bufala Campana, made with milk from water buffalo raised in the marshlands of Campania and Lazio. This mozzarella is protected with its own European protected designation of origin. Other traditional pizzas include \"pizza alla marinara\", which is topped with marinara sauce and is supposedly the most ancient tomato-topped pizza, pizza capricciosa, which is prepared with mozzarella cheese, baked ham, mushroom, artichoke, and tomato, and pizza pugliese, prepared with tomato, mozzarella, and onions.\nA popular variant of pizza in Italy is Sicilian pizza (locally called \"sfincione\" or \"sfinciuni\"), a thick-crust or deep-dish pizza originating during the 17th century in Sicily: it is essentially a focaccia that is typically topped with tomato sauce and other ingredients. Until the 1860s, \"sfincione\" was the type of pizza usually consumed in Sicily, especially in the Western portion of the island. Other variations of pizzas are also found in other regions of Italy, for example \"pizza al padellino\" or \"pizza al tegamino\", a small-sized, thick-crust, deep-dish pizza typically served in Turin, Piedmont.\nUnited States.\nThe first pizzeria in the U.S. was opened in New York City's Little Italy in 1905. Common toppings for pizza in the United States include anchovies, ground beef, chicken, ham, mushrooms, olives, onions, peppers, pepperoni, pineapple, salami, sausage, spinach, steak, and tomatoes. Distinct regional types developed in the 20th century, including Buffalo, California, Chicago, Detroit, Greek, New Haven, New York, and St. Louis styles. These regional variations include deep-dish, stuffed, pockets, turnovers, rolled, and pizza-on-a-stick, each with seemingly limitless combinations of sauce and toppings.\nThirteen percent of the United States population consumes pizza on any given day. Pizza chains such as Domino's Pizza, Pizza Hut, and Papa John's, pizzas from take and bake pizzerias, and chilled or frozen pizzas from supermarkets make pizza readily available nationwide.\nArgentina.\nArgentina, and more specifically Buenos Aires, received a massive Italian immigration at the end of the 19th century. Immigrants from Naples and Genoa opened the first pizza bars, though over time Spanish residents came to own the majority of the pizza businesses.\nStandard Argentine pizza has a thicker crust, called \"media masa\" (half dough) than traditional Italian style pizza and uses more cheese. In Argentina pizza slices are often served topped with fain\u00e1, a Genoese chickpea-flour pancake, and accompanied by moscato wine. The most popular variety of pizza is called \"muzzarella\" (mozzarella), similar to Neapolitan pizza (bread, tomato sauce and cheese) but made with a thicker \"media masa\" crust, triple cheese and tomato sauce, usually also with olives. It can be found in nearly every corner of the country; Buenos Aires is considered the city with the most pizza bars per person of the world. Other popular varieties include ham, tomato slices, red pepper and longaniza. Two Argentine-originated varieties of pizza with onion, are also very popular: fugazza with cheese, a regular pizza crust topped with cheese and onions, and fugazzetta, with the cheese between two pizza crusts, with onions on top.\nRecords.\n according to \"Guinness World Records\":\nPizza and health.\nSome pizzas mass-produced by pizza chains have been criticized as having an unhealthy balance of ingredients. Pizza can be high in salt, fat, and calories. The USDA reports an average sodium content of 5,101\u00a0mg per pizza in fast food chains. There are concerns about undesirable health effects.\nFrequent pizza eaters in Italy have been found to have a relatively low incidence of cardiovascular disease and digestive tract cancers relative to infrequent pizza eaters, although the nature of the association between pizza and such perceived benefits is unclear. Pizza consumption in Italy might only indicate adherence to traditional Mediterranean dietary patterns, which have been shown to have various health benefits.\nSome attribute the apparent health benefits of pizza to the lycopene content in pizza sauce, which research indicates likely plays a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease and various cancers."}
{"title": "Baby_food", "label": "Food", "text": "Baby food is any soft, easily consumed food other than breastmilk or infant formula that is made specifically for human babies between four and six months and two years old. The food comes in many varieties and flavors that are purchased ready-made from producers, or it may be table food eaten by the family that has been mashed or otherwise broken down.\nReadiness.\nAs of 2011, the World Health Organization, UNICEF and many national health agencies recommended waiting until six months of age before starting a child on food; individual babies may differ greatly from this guideline based on their unique developmental progress. Baby food can be given when the child is developmentally ready to eat. Signs of readiness include the ability to sit without help, loss of tongue thrust, and the display of active interest in food that others are eating.\nHealth.\nAs a global public health recommendation, the World Health Organization recommends that infants should be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life to achieve optimal growth, development and health. Most six-month-old infants are physiologically and developmentally ready for new foods, textures and modes of feeding. Experts advising the World Health Assembly have provided evidence that introducing solids earlier than six months increases babies' chances of illness, without improving growth.\nOne of the health concerns associated with the introduction of solid foods before six months is iron deficiency. The early introduction of complementary foods may satisfy the hunger of the infant, resulting in less frequent breastfeeding and ultimately less milk production in the mother. Because iron absorption from human milk is depressed when the milk is in contact with other foods in the proximal small bowel, early use of complementary foods may increase the risk of iron depletion and anemia.\nIn Canada sodium content in infant food is regulated; strained fruit, fruit juice, fruit drink, and cereal cannot be sold if sodium has been added (excluding strained desserts). Foods naturally containing sodium are limited to 0.05 - 0.25 grams per 100 grams of food, depending on the type of infant food.\nIf there is a family history of allergies, one may wish to introduce only one new food at a time, leaving a few days in between to notice any reactions that would indicate a food allergy or sensitivity. This way, if the child is unable to tolerate a certain food, it can be determined which food is causing the reaction.\nMeeting the nutritional needs of infants as they grow is essential for their healthy development. Feeding infants inappropriately or insufficiently can cause major illnesses and affect their physical and mental development. Educational campaigns that share information on when to introduce solid foods, appropriate types of foods to feed an infant, and hygiene practices are effective at improving these feeding practices.\nNutritional needs and the amount of food.\nNewborns need a diet of breastmilk or infant formula. About 40% of the food energy in these milks comes from carbohydrates, mostly from a simple sugar called lactose.\nAs shown in the 2008 \"Feeding Infants and Toddlers\" study, the overall diet of babies and toddlers, the primary consumers of baby food, generally meets or significantly exceeds the recommended amount of macronutrients. Toddlers and preschoolers generally ate too little dietary fiber, and preschoolers generally ate too much saturated fat, although the overall fat intake was lower than recommended. Micronutrient levels were typically within the recommended levels. A small group of older infants in the American study needed more iron and zinc, such as from iron-fortified baby foods. A substantial proportion of toddlers and preschoolers exceeded the upper recommended level of synthetic folate, preformed vitamin A, zinc, and sodium (salt).\nThe World Health Organization recommends starting in small amounts that gradually increase as the child gets older: 2 to 3 meals per day for infants 6 to 8 months of age and 3 to 4 meals per day for infants 9 to 23 months of age, with 1 or 2 additional snacks as required.\nPreparation and feeding.\nBaby foods are either a soft, liquid paste or an easily chewed food since babies lack developed muscles and teeth to effectively chew. Babies typically move to consuming baby food once nursing or formula is not sufficient for the child's appetite. Babies do not need to have teeth to transition to eating solid foods. Teeth, however, normally do begin to show up at this age. Care should be taken with certain foods that pose a choking hazard, such as undercooked vegetables, grapes, or food that may contain bones. Babies begin eating liquid style baby food consisting of pureed vegetables and fruits, sometimes mixed with rice cereal and formula, or breastmilk. Then, as the baby is better able to chew, small, soft pieces or lumps may be included. Care should be taken, as babies with teeth have the ability to break off pieces of food but they do not possess the back molars to grind, so food can be carefully mashed or prechewed, or broken into manageable pieces for their baby. Around 6 months of age, babies may begin to feed themselves (picking up food pieces with hands, using the whole fist, or later the pincer grasp [the thumb and forefinger]) with help from parents.\nHomemade or commercial.\nHomemade baby food is less expensive than commercial baby foods. Homemade food is appropriate only when the family has a sufficient and varied diet, as well as access to refrigeration and basic sanitation. It is important to follow proper sanitation methods when preparing homemade baby food such as washing and rinsing vegetables or fruit, as well as the cooking and packaging materials that will be used.\nHomemade food requires more preparation time than simply opening a jar or box of ready-to-eat commercial baby food. Food may need to be minced or pureed for young babies, or cooked separately without the salt, intense spices, or sugar that the family chooses to eat. Avocados and bananas are foods that can be easily mashed and are high in vitamins and nutrients, making them ideal starter foods for an infant 6 months in age or older.\nTypes.\nThrough the first year, breastmilk or infant formula is the main source of calories and nutrients.\nBabies may be started directly on normal family food if attention is given to choking hazards; this is called baby-led weaning. Because breastmilk takes on the flavor of foods eaten by the mother, these foods are especially good choices.\nToddler foods.\nSome commercial baby food companies have expanded their lines to produce specialty foods for toddlers from the age of about 12 months to two and a half years old. These include juice, cereal, small microwaveable meals, baked goods, and other foods that have been formulated and marketed for toddlers.\nGeriatric use.\nIn the late 1940s, Gerber Products Company and Beech-Nut produced special cookbooks to promote the sale of commercial baby foods for use by elderly, sick, or disabled people.\nPicky eating.\nParents and/or caregivers may perceive up to half of toddlers as being \"picky\" or \"faddy\", with the peak around 24 months. Adults who hold this opinion often stop offering new foods to the child after only three to five attempts, rather than continuing to offer the food until the child has tasted it eight to fifteen times. They may also engage in counterproductive behaviors, such as offering appetite-suppressing milk or other favorite foods as an alternative, or trying to force or bribe the child into eating.\nHistorical and cultural.\nBaby food varies from culture to culture. In many cultures, pastes of a grain and liquids are the first baby food. In human history and presently with many cultures around the world, babies are fed food premasticated by the caretaker of the baby in order to pulverise the food and start the digestion process. An infant's first bite of solid food is ceremonial and holds religious importance in many cultures. An example of this is annaprashan, a Hindu ritual where the infant is fed a sweetened rice porridge, usually blessed, by an elder family member. Similar rites of passage are practiced across Asia, including the Bengal region, Vietnam, and Thailand.\nIn the Western world until the mid-1900s, baby food was generally made at home. The industrial revolution saw the beginning of the baby food market which promoted commercial baby foods as convenience items. In developed countries, babies are now often started with commercially produced iron-fortified infant cereals, and then move on to mashed fruits and vegetables. Commercial baby foods are widely available in dry, ready-to-feed and frozen forms, often in small batches (e.g. small jars) for convenience of preparation. On the contrary, in developing countries, breastfeeding is more widely accepted and socially tolerated in public, thus creating a societal contrast. Amy Bentley, author of \"Inventing Baby Food\", talks about how infant feeding reflects one's \"position in the postwar era of the American Century\" because in developed countries, families are able to purchase processed baby foods to feed their children, whereas in developing country, natural breastfeeding is more popular.\nCommercially prepared baby foods in the Netherlands were first prepared by Martinus van der Hagen through his NV Nutricia company in 1901. In United States they were first prepared by Harold Clapp who sold Clapp's Baby Food in the 1920s. The Fremont Canning Company, now called the Gerber Products Company, started in 1927. The Beech-Nut company entered the U.S. baby food market in 1931. The first precooked dried baby food was Pablum which was originally made for sick children in the 1930s. Other commercial baby food manufacturers include H. J. Heinz Company, Nestl\u00e9, Nutricia, Organix and Unilever. Heinz produced dehydrated baby food in the 1980s. The demand from parents for organic food began to grow in the 1960s; since then, many larger commercial manufacturers have introduced organic lines of infant food.\nAt the beginning of the 20th century in America, most babies began eating baby food around the age of seven months. During and shortly after World War II, the age at which solid food was first introduced dropped to just six weeks. This age has since increased to four to six months. By the mid-20th century, manufactured baby food was readily used and supplemented previous infant feeding practices. Author of \"Inventing Baby Food\", Amy Bentley argues that the excessive additives of sugar, salt, and MSG in overused manufactured baby food conditioned infants to prefer processed foods later in life. Also, it is believed that exposing infants to solid foods at an earlier age well help them get used to foods later on in life. This subsequent misuse of salt and sugar was also feared to effect issues of weight and nutrition based diseases.\nIn China and other east Asian countries, homemade baby food remains common, and babies are started on rice porridge called xifan, then move on to mashed fruits, soft vegetables, tofu and fish. In Sweden, it is common to start with mashed fruit, such as bananas, as well as oatmeal and mashed vegetables. In western Africa, maize porridge is often the first solid food given to young children.\nControversies.\nSome commercial baby foods have been criticized for their contents and cost.\nOver the decades, there have been multiple recalls of baby foods because of concerns about contamination or spoilage. In 1984 and 1986, Gerber was involved in a scandal over glass baby food jars breaking in transit, which dramatically affected its sales and profitability, although the US Food and Drug Administration later concluded that the company was not at fault. In 1987, Beechnut paid US$25 million to resolve charges of selling adulterated apple juice in the early 1980s. In 2011, Nestl\u00e9 France decided to recall a batch of \"P'tit pot\" baby food as a precautionary measure after a customer reportedly found glass shards in one of their jars. An investigation into the incident's scope led the company to conclude that it had been an isolated occurrence and that the rest of the batch had not been affected.\nMarket.\nAccording to Zion Market Research, the market size for baby food in the United States is estimated to be $53 billion in 2018 and growing to $76 billion by 2021.\nCommercial baby food in the United States is dominated by Gerber, which had about 70% of the American market share in 1996. Beechnut had about 15% of the market, and Heinz had about 10%. Heinz's Earth's Best, the largest brand of organic baby food, had about 2% of the American market share.\nIn Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, Heinz had about 90% of the market share in 1996. Heinz is also the market leader in the UK, Italy, and several eastern European countries."}
{"title": "Ramen", "label": "Food", "text": " is a Japanese noodle soup. It consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a meat or (occasionally) fish-based broth, often flavored with soy sauce or miso, and uses toppings such as , nori (dried seaweed), menma, and scallions. Nearly every region in Japan has its own variation of ramen, such as the \"tonkotsu\" (pork bone broth) ramen of Kyushu, and the \"miso\" ramen of Hokkaido. \"Mazemen\" is a ramen dish that is not served in a soup, but rather with a sauce (such as \"tare\").\nHistory.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"ramen\" is a Japanese borrowing of the Mandarin Chinese \"l\u0101mi\u00e0n\" (, \"pulled noodles\"). In 1910, the first ramen shop named \"\" (\u6765\u3005\u8ed2) opened at Asakusa, Tokyo, where the Japanese owner employed 12 Cantonese cooks from Yokohama's Chinatown and served the ramen arranged for Japanese customers. Until the 1950s, ramen was called \"shina soba\" (\u652f\u90a3\u305d\u3070, literally \"Chinese soba\"). Today \"ch\u016bka soba\" (\u4e2d\u83ef\u305d\u3070, also meaning \"Chinese soba\") or just \"ramen\" (\u30e9\u30fc\u30e1\u30f3) are more common, as the word \"\u652f\u90a3\" (\"shina\", meaning \"China\") has acquired a pejorative connotation.\nOrigin.\nRamen is a Japanese adaptation of Chinese wheat noodles. One theory says that ramen was introduced to Japan during the 1660s by the Chinese neo-Confucian scholar Zhu Shunsui who served as an advisor to Tokugawa Mitsukuni after he became a refugee in Japan to escape Manchu rule and Mitsukuni became the first Japanese person to eat ramen. Most historians reject this theory as a myth created by the Japanese to embellish the origins of ramen. \nAccording to historians, the more plausible theory is that ramen was introduced to Japan in the late 19th or early 20th century by Chinese immigrants living in the Yokohama Chinatown. According to the record of the Yokohama Ramen Museum, ramen originated in China and made its way to Japan in 1859. Early versions were wheat noodles in broth topped with Chinese-style roast pork.\nBy 1900, restaurants serving Chinese cuisine from Canton and Shanghai offered a simple dish of noodles (cut rather than hand-pulled), a few toppings, and a broth flavored with salt and pork bones. Many Chinese living in Japan also pulled portable food stalls, selling ramen and gy\u014dza dumplings to workers. By the mid-1900s, these stalls used a type of a musical horn called a \"charumera\" (\u30c1\u30e3\u30eb\u30e1\u30e9, from the Portuguese \"charamela\") to advertise their presence, a practice some vendors still retain via a loudspeaker and a looped recording. By the early Sh\u014dwa period, ramen had become a popular dish when eating out. According to ramen expert Hiroshi Osaki, the first specialized ramen shop opened in Yokohama in 1910.\nPostwar popularization.\nAfter Japan's defeat in World War II, the American military occupied the country from 1945 to 1952. In December 1945, Japan recorded its worst rice harvest in 42 years, which caused food shortages as Japan had drastically reduced rice production during the war as production shifted to colonies in China and Taiwan. The US flooded the market with cheap wheat flour to deal with food shortages. From 1948 to 1951, bread consumption in Japan increased from 262,121 tons to 611,784 tons, but wheat also found its way into ramen, which most Japanese ate at black market food vendors to survive as the government food distribution system ran about 20 days behind schedule. Although the Americans maintained Japan's wartime ban on outdoor food vending, flour was secretly diverted from commercial mills into the black markets, where nearly 90 percent of stalls were under the control of gangsters locally referred to as \"yakuza\" who extorted vendors for protection money. Thousands of ramen vendors were arrested during the occupation. \nIn the same period, millions of Japanese troops returned from China and continental East Asia from their posts in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Some of them would have been familiar with wheat noodles. By 1950 wheat flour exchange controls were removed and restrictions on food vending loosened, which further boosted the number of ramen vendors: private companies even rented out \"yatai\" starter kits consisting of noodles, toppings, bowls, and chopsticks. Ramen \"yatai\" provided a rare opportunity for small scale postwar entrepreneurship. The Americans also aggressively advertised the nutritional benefits of wheat and animal protein. The combination of these factors caused wheat noodles to gain prominence in Japan's rice-based culture. Gradually, ramen became associated with urban life.\nModern period.\nIn 1958, instant noodles were invented by Momofuku Ando, the Taiwanese-Japanese founder and chairman of Nissin Foods. Named the greatest Japanese invention of the 20th century in a Japanese poll, instant ramen allowed anyone to make an approximation of this dish simply by adding boiling water.\nBeginning in the 1980s, ramen became a Japanese cultural icon and was studied around the world. At the same time, local varieties of ramen were hitting the national market and could even be ordered by their regional names. A ramen museum opened in Yokohama in 1994.\nToday ramen is one of Japan's most popular foods, with Tokyo alone containing around 5,000 ramen shops, and more than 24,000 ramen shops across Japan. \"Tsuta\", a ramen restaurant in Tokyo's Sugamo district, received a Michelin star in December 2015.\nRamen restaurants were particularly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in Japan, with 34 chains filing for bankruptcy by September 2020. Ramen restaurants are typically narrow and seat customers closely, making social distancing difficult.\nTypes.\nA wide variety of ramen exists in Japan, with geographical and vendor-specific differences even in varieties that share the same name. Although ramen usually has toppings, ramen can be broadly categorized by its two main ingredients: noodles and broth.\nNoodles.\nMost noodles are made from four basic ingredients: wheat flour, salt, water, and (from ) a type of alkaline mineral water, containing sodium carbonate and usually potassium carbonate, as well as sometimes a small amount of phosphoric acid. Although ramen noodles and Udon noodles are both made with wheat and are similar, they are different kinds of noodle.\nThe \"kansui\" is the distinguishing ingredient in ramen noodles, and originated in Inner Mongolia, where some lakes contain large amounts of these minerals and whose water is said to be perfect for making these noodles. Making noodles with \"kansui\" lends them a yellowish hue as well as a firm texture. Eggs may also be substituted for \"kansui\". Some noodles are made with neither eggs nor \"kansui\" and should only be used for yakisoba, as they have a weaker structure and are more prone to soaking up moisture and becoming extremely soft when served in soup.\nRamen comes in various shapes and lengths. It may be thick, thin, or even ribbon-like, as well as straight or wrinkled.\nTraditionally, ramen noodles were made by hand, but with growing popularity many ramen restaurants prefer to use noodle-making machines to meet the increased demand and improve quality. Automatic ramen-making machines imitating manual production methods have been available since the mid. 20th century produced by such Japanese manufacturers as Yamato MFG. and others.\nSoup.\nRamen soup is generally made from stock based on chicken or pork, combined with a variety of ingredients such as pork bones, katsuobushi (skipjack tuna flakes), niboshi (dried baby sardines), beef bones, shiitake, onions, and kombu (kelp). Some modern ramen broths can also be vegetable-based. Tare is often added to broth to make the soup.\nFlavors.\nThe resulting combination is generally divided into several categories. Although newer and older variations often make this categorization less clear-cut, a description of said old variations are as follows:\nToppings.\nAfter basic preparation, ramen can be seasoned and flavored with any number of toppings, including but not limited to:\nPreference.\nSeasonings commonly added to ramen are white pepper, black pepper, butter, chili pepper, sesame seeds, and crushed garlic. Soup recipes and methods of preparation tend to be closely guarded secrets.\nMost \"tonkotsu\" ramen restaurants offer a system known as \"kae-dama\" (\u66ff\u3048\u7389), where customers who have finished their noodles can request a \"refill\" (for a few hundred yen more) to be put into their remaining soup.\nRegional variations.\nWhile standard versions of ramen are available throughout Japan since the Taish\u014d period, the last few decades have shown a proliferation of regional variations. Some of these which have gone on to national prominence are:\nRelated dishes.\nThere are many related, Chinese-influenced noodle dishes in Japan. The following are often served alongside ramen in ramen establishments. They do not include noodle dishes considered traditionally Japanese, such as soba or udon, which are almost never served in the same establishments as ramen.\nRestaurants in Japan.\nRamen is offered in various types of restaurants and locations including ramen shops, \"izakaya\" drinking establishments, lunch cafeterias, karaoke halls, and amusement parks. Many ramen restaurants only have a counter and a chef. In these shops, the meals are paid for in advance at a ticket machine to streamline the process.\nHowever, the best quality ramen is usually only available in specialist \"ramen-ya\" restaurants. Some restaurants also provide Halalramen (using chicken) in Osaka and Kyoto. As \"ramen-ya\" restaurants offer mainly ramen dishes, they tend to lack variety in the menu. Besides ramen, some of the dishes generally available in a \"ramen-ya\" restaurant include other dishes from Japanese Chinese cuisine such as fried rice (called \"Chahan\" or \"Yakimeshi\"), \"gyoza\" (Chinese dumplings), and beer. \"Ramen-ya\" interiors are often filled with Chinese-inspired decorations.\nOutside Japan.\nRamen became popular in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan where it is known as r\u00ecsh\u00ec l\u0101mi\u00e0n (, lit. \"Japanese-style lamian\"). Restaurant chains serve ramen alongside distinctly Japanese dishes, such as tempura and yakitori. Interestingly, in Japan, these dishes are not traditionally served with ramen, but gyoza, kara-age and others from Japanese Chinese cuisine.\nIn Korea, ramen is called \"ramyeon\" (). There are different varieties, such as kimchi-flavored \"ramyeon\". While usually served with vegetables such as carrots and scallions, or eggs, some restaurants serve variations of \"ramyeon\" containing additional ingredients such as dumplings, tteok, or cheese as topping.\nOutside of Asia, particularly in areas with a large demand for Asian cuisine, there are restaurants specializing in Japanese-style foods such as ramen noodles. For example, Wagamama, a UK-based restaurant chain serving pan-Asian food, serves a ramen noodle soup; in the United States and Canada, Jinya Ramen Bar serves \"tonkotsu\" ramen.\nInstant ramen.\nInstant ramen noodles were exported from Japan by Nissin Foods starting in 1971, bearing the name \"Oodles of Noodles\". One year later, it was re-branded \"Nissin Cup Noodles\", packaged in a foam food container (It is referred to as Cup Ramen in Japan), and subsequently saw a growth in international sales. Over time, the term \"ramen\" became used in North America to refer to other instant noodles. While some research has claimed that consuming instant ramen two or more times a week increases the likelihood of developing heart disease and other conditions, including diabetes and stroke, especially in women, those claims have not been reproduced and no study has isolated instant ramen consumption as an aggravating factor. Instant ramen noodles, known to have a serving of 43 g, consist of very high sodium. At least 1,760 mg of sodium are found in one packet alone. It consists of 385k calories, 55.7 g of carbohydrates, 14.5 g of total fat, 6.5 g of saturated fat, 7.9 g of protein, and 0.6 mg of thiamine.\nCanned version.\nIn Akihabara, vending machines distribute warm ramen in a steel can known as . It is produced by a popular local ramen restaurant in flavors such as \"tonkotsu\" and curry, and contains noodles, soup, menma, and pork. It is intended as a quick snack, and includes a small folded plastic fork. \nIn popular culture.\nMovies.\nIn the 1985 film \"Tampopo\", A truck driver, Goro, helps a woman called Tampopo create the perfect ramen restaurant.\nRamen and how it is made was the subject of the 2008 feature film \"The Ramen Girl\", starring Brittany Murphy.\nEmoji.\nIn October 2010, an emoji was approved for Unicode 6.0 for \"Steaming Bowl\", that depicts Japanese ramen noodles in a bowl of steaming broth with chopsticks. In 2015, the icon was added to Emoji 1.0.\nMuseum.\nThe Shin-Yokohama R\u0101men Museum is a unique museum about ramen, in the Shin-Yokohama district of K\u014dhoku-ku, Yokohama.\nFurther reading.\nHow to Customize your Ramen - Toppings and Japanese Vocabulary"}
{"title": "K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs", "label": "Food", "text": " (; sometimes improperly rendered as \"Kurtosh Kalach\"; ; ) is a spit cake specific to the Sz\u00e9kelys of Transylvania. Originally popular in the Hungarian-speaking regions of Romania, more predominantly the Sz\u00e9kely Land, it became popular in both Romania and Hungary. The first written record dates back to 1679 and was found in the village of \u00dazdiszentp\u00e9ter (now S\u00e2npetru de C\u00e2mpie), while the first recipe appears in a manuscript cookbook dated in 1781. Earlier a festive treat, now it is part of everyday consumption. In Transylvania, a similar pastry to K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is \"Baumstriezel\", originating from the Saxon communities.\nK\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is made from sweet, yeast dough (raised dough), of which a strip is spun and then wrapped around a truncated cone\u2013shaped baking spit, and rolled in granulated sugar. It is roasted over charcoal while basted with melted butter, until its surface cooks to a golden-brown color. During the baking process the sugar stuck on the caramelises and forms a shiny, crispy crust. The surface of the cake can then be topped with additional ingredients such as ground walnut or powdered cinnamon.\nEtymology.\nThe name refers to a stovepipe (\"\"), since the fresh, steaming cake in the shape of a truncated cone resembles a hot chimney.\nThis opinion is shared by , scholar and philologist from Cluj-Napoca: \"...when taken off from the spit in one piece, the cake assumes the shape of a long vent or tube. Since the cake is served in this tubular form to family and guests, and consumers are faced with this typical, vent-like image of the dough to be torn off in strips, it is self-evident that its name must have been given with regard to the vent shape of the cake\".\nThroughout the centuries, miscellaneous alternate names and spellings of \"k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs\" have been used. More references were mentioned even in the 19th century (e.g. 'spit-donut' or 'stick roll' or 'stick-donut'). The name \"k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs\" originated in Transylvania and became popular only by the middle of the 20th century. Until the end of the century it had different spellings (e.g. spelt with \u2018\u00f6\u2019 as in ('horn cake') or in two words, as in . The present variant \"k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs\" was first used in print in a cookbook, published in 1926 by the book department of 'Brass\u00f3i Lapok\u2019, a newspaper from Bra\u0219ov.\nMeasures to have k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs registered in the European Union as a Protected designation of origin (PDO) product have been taken.\nHistory.\nThe first known record that hints at a family of cakes baked by rotating spit over cinders dates back to Medieval times (about 1450) and is found in a manuscript from Heidelberg. The description mentions a strip of raised dough that has to be wound in a helix shape around a baking spit, and brushed with egg yolk before baking.\nIn the 16th century, the evolution of the cake family proceeded in three branches. The first branch contains pastries that preserved the image of cake similar to the one mentioned above, with a strip wound on spit in a helical shape. The Szekler-Hungarian k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs, \"Skalicky trdelnik\" (trdeln\u00edk from Skalica), and the Czech-Moravian \"trdlo/trdelnice/trdelnik\", which is virtually the same as the latter, as well as the \"k\u00fcrt\u0151sf\u00e1nk\" (k\u00fcrt\u0151sh donut) belong to this branch. The second branch has pastries made from batter, namely the Lithuanian \"raguolis\" and \"\u0161akotis\", Polish \"s\u0119kacz\", the French \"gateau a la broche\", the German \"Baumkuchen\", the Austrian \"Pr\u00fcgertorte\" and \"Pr\u00fcgelkrapfen\" as well as the Swedish \"Spettekaka\". The third branch is represented by one cake, the Transylvanian-Saxon \"Baumstriezel\", where a continuous dough strip is placed on a spit.\nThe first known recipe of K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs originates from Transylvania, included in the 1784 cookbook of Countess M\u00e1ria Mikes of Zabola (\"\u2018k\u00fcrt\u0151s kal\u00e1ts\u2019 \u00e0 la Mrs. Por\u00e1ni\"). It makes no mention, however, of sweetening of any kind in the preparation. A recipe from the cookbook written by Krist\u00f3f Simai in 1795 in Upper Hungary (present-day Slovakia) first mentioned \"sweetening subsequent to baking\". \"Trdelnik from Skalica\" is based on similar preparation, with the cake surface covered in chopped nuts (e.g. walnut, almond) before baking, and sugar that is added only subsequent to baking.\nAlmost 100 years passed before the first mention was made of the next step in the evolution of k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs, the appearance of a caramelized sugar glaze, in \"Aunt R\u00e9zi\u2019s Cookbook\" written by Ter\u00e9zia Dolecsk\u00f3 in 1876, published in Szeged, Hungary. The recipe suggests \"sprinkling sugar (sugar almond) on dough on spit a priory to baking\". Due to the heat, the sugar is caramelized and also enters in what is known as Maillard reaction. The sugar glaze that melts to become caramel forms a continuous coat, also adds to firmness of cake. Shortly afterwards, pure sugar (not almond sugar) was applied to the dough's surface before baking, even with the omission of sweetening subsequent to baking. \u00c1gnes Zilahi's cookbook entitled \"Val\u00f3di Magyar szak\u00e1csk\u00f6nyv\" (The Real Hungarian Cookbook), which appeared in Budapest in 1892, presents such a recipe.\nThe first mention of additional toppings applied to the caramel glaze appears in \"R\u00e9zi n\u00e9ni szak\u00e1csk\u00f6nyve (Aunt R\u00e9zi\u2019s Cookbook)\". The use of ground, chopped or candied walnuts applied as an additional topping became popular only in the late 20th century. As far as we know P\u00e1l K\u00f6vi's cookbook, \"Erd\u00e9lyi lakoma\" (Transylvanian Feast), which came out in 1980, seems to be the first source with the tip of applying this type of topping. The wide spectrum of cinnamon, coconut, cocoa, etc. toppings started to receive wide application only at the end of the century.\nThe current, most frequently baked variant of k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs evolved in Szeklerland in the first half of the 20th century. It is specific to this variant that the surface of the raw dough wrapped around the spit flattens out by the usual procedure of rolling it on a flat surface sprinkled with granulated sugar. By this procedure the layers of dough wrapped around the spit are pressed together, rendering the cake smoother, more compact in structure and more elegant. The first written record of this technique appears in the cookbook of Mrs. Zathureczky, n\u00e9e Manci Zlech, which was published in Bar\u00f3t between 1934 and 1943. The cookbook, entitled \"Erd\u00e9lyi \u00edzek\" (\"Flavors of Transylvania\"), which appeared in Miercurea-Ciuc, published in 2007, gives a recipe of this sort.\nSpread.\nK\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs became popular among the Hungarian nobility at the beginning of the 18th century. One hint at an Austrian or German origin is the fact that a conservative Transylvanian nobleman, P\u00e9ter Apor, in his work \"Metamorphosis Transylvaniae\" does not mention K\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs in the list of traditional Hungarian foods, for all the evidence we have about the cake already existing in his wife's cuisine. In a letter from a mother superior in Moldavia addressed to Mrs P\u00e9ter Apor, n\u00e9e Borb\u00e1la K\u00e1lnoki, the writer asks Mrs. Apor to have a butler of hers taught the art of baking k\u00fcrt\u0151slal\u00e1cs: \"Honored mother Superior prays you if she could send you a butler in the hope perchance you spare no pain and teach him kindly some art of baking k\u00fcrt\u0151slal\u00e1cs withal others\".\nBy the end of the 18th century, k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs had become popular in all Hungarian speaking regions as a defining element of both urban and rustic cuisine. In the first volume of \"A Sz\u00e9kelyf\u00f6ld le\u00edr\u00e1sa\" (Description of the Szeklerland) from 1868, Bal\u00e1zs Orb\u00e1n writes about the genesis legend of Udvarhelysz\u00e9k, which holds that the Szeklers, chased into caves and later blockaded by the Tatars, eventually made the enemy leave by presenting them a huge k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs made of straw which they held out of the cave to show they had supplies to endure the siege. Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, the recipe of the cake was recorded in numerous popular cookbooks.\nAs a result of urbanization at the beginning of the 20th century, k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs was replaced by newer cakes. But on the eastern periphery of the Hungarian speaking regions, in the Szeklerland, the open fireplace survived to the end of the 19th century, and consequently, k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs has been preserved as a living tradition on regions dwelt by Szeklers. Up to the present k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs baked above cinders is regarded as essential to the Transylvanian wedding menu.\nFollowing the change of regime in 1989, k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs became the traditional local treat offered to Hungarian tourists visiting Szekler villages and thus an element of the international image of both the Szeklerland and Transylvania. This gastronomic tradition, which earlier had been preserved merely in rural Szekler communities, gradually found its way back to the culture of the Hungarian elite, mainly due to tourism. By the middle of the 1990s, k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs became popular in most cities in Hungary, and tourists visiting Hungary reported on \"the gorgeous, sweet, tubular treat\" with admiration.\nBecause of international migrations and tourism, however, k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is also no longer regarded as a solely Szekler or Hungarian symbol, but rather as representative of European gastronomy.\nVariants.\nThree variants of k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs can be distinguished, which are nonetheless, manufactured in a similar way.\nThe recipe of the traditional, homemade variant became standardized at the beginning of the 20th century. The ingredients are firmly specified and it is usually baked above cinders. The essential ingredients are exclusively: sugar, wheat flour, butter, milk, eggs, yeast and salt. Additional toppings are restricted to ground or chopped walnut, almond, cinnamon powder or vanilla sugar made from natural vanilla powder.\nVariants at carnivals became popular in the late 20th century. With this variant, the recipe is more flexible so that it can be manufactured in smaller, mobile places, rendering it much cheaper. In this variant, butter can be replaced by vegetable oil or margarine, and milk by milk powder. Moreover, eggs can be replaced by egg powder or liquid eggs, but this ingredient can also be omitted. In exchange, grated lemon zest, natural citrus extract or citrus juice, rum or vanilla sugar powder can be added to the dough. The surface can be provided any additional topping that bears flavor and aroma.\nFurther alternative variants appeared at the beginning of the 21st century. These recipes can be even more flexible. The dough can be made of non\u2013wheat flour. The inner, tubular part can be also given an additional coating, and it can abound in other natural ingredients (e.g. pieces of fruit). Alternative k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs can be prepared gluten free as well. A cake that lacks ingredients of animal origin (milk, butter, eggs) can be labeled as \u2018Vegan\u2019 or \u2018Lent\u2019.\nK\u00fcrt\u0151sf\u00e1nk (K\u00fcrt\u0151sh Donut) is a similar-shaped cake, which is baked in oil or fat and topped with sugar after baking or stuffed with whipped cream.\nBaking process.\nK\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs is made of a relatively hard and dry yeast-dough. A \"twine\" of dough is wrapped around the length of the spit, and then the spit with the strip of dough on it is rolled in sugar. Before or during baking, it's brushed with melted butter. The cake is ready when its surface has an even, brownish\u2013red color. Strictly, homemade k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs can be made exclusively from natural ingredients (flour, sugar, milk, butter, eggs, yeast and salt). For other variants, of all ingredients it is merely margarine and vanilla sugar powder that can be synthetic, including ingredients of the final topping.\nK\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs can be enriched by further aromas and flavors if the completed cake is provided a final topping. Any topping can be used\nthat does not contain salt, cheese, meat or other non-confectionery ingredients.\nAmong pastries that are most closely related to k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs, the Transylvanian Saxon \"Baumstriezel\" has a cylinder shape, rather than a helix. Skalicky Trdelnik from Slovakia (formerly Upper Hungary), as well as Trdlo/Trdelnice/Trdelnik from the Czech\u2013Moravian region, differ from k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs in that there is no caramel sugar glaze applied to their surface.\nForeign names.\nNeighboring nations have their own names for the cake. Amongst Saxons, who earlier dwelt in Transylvania, the literal translation of the word k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs, or \"Schornsteinkuchen\", became popular. Poles and Romanians use both the phonetic transcription of the word k\u00fcrt\u0151skal\u00e1cs and the translation of the adjective \u2013 noun cluster of \"magyar kal\u00e1cs\" or \"sz\u00e9kely kal\u00e1cs\" (Kurtoszkalacz or \"Wegierski kolacz\" and respectively \"Colac Secuiesc\" or \"Cozonac Secuiesc\"). Other versions use either a phonetic transcription of the entire compound word (\"Kurtosh Kalach\"), or a phonetic transcription of the cluster's first element, such as \"Kurtosh\" for \"k\u00fcrt\u0151s\" followed by a translation of its second element, such as \"cake\" for \"kal\u00e1cs\"."}
{"title": "Jiaozi", "label": "Food", "text": "Jiaozi (; ) are Chinese dumplings commonly eaten in China and other parts of East Asia. \"Jiaozi\" are folded to resemble Chinese sycee and have great cultural significance attached to them within China. \"Jiaozi\" are one of the major dishes eaten during the Chinese New Year throughout the entire country and eaten all year round in the northern provinces. Though considered part of Chinese cuisine, \"jiaozi\" are popular in other parts of East Asia and in the Western world, where a fried variety is sometimes called potstickers. The English-language term \"potsticker\" is a calque of the Mandarin word \u934b\u8cbc \"guotie\". \"Potsticker\" was used by Buwei Yang Chao and her husband Yuen Ren Chao in the book \"How to Cook and Eat in Chinese\", which was first published in 1945. In northern China, however, \u934b\u8cbc \"guotie\" specifically refers to a type of pan-fried \"jiaozi\" with its ends left open rather than just any pan-fried \"jiaozi\".\n\"Jiaozi\" typically consist of a ground meat and/or vegetable filling wrapped into a thinly rolled piece of dough, which is then sealed by pressing the edges together. Finished \"jiaozi\" can be boiled (\"shu\u01d0 ji\u01ceo\"), steamed (\"zh\u0113ng ji\u01ceo\"), pan fried (\"ji\u0101n ji\u01ceo\"), or deep fried (\"zh\u00e0 ji\u01ceo\"), and are traditionally served with a black vinegar and sesame oil dip. They can also be served in a soup (\"t\u0101ng ji\u01ceo\").\nOrigin and custom.\nIn China, there are several different folk stories explaining the origin of \"jiaozi\" and its name.\nTraditionally, \"jiaozi\" were thought to be invented during the era of the Eastern Han (AD 25\u2013220) by Zhang Zhongjing who was a great practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine. \"Jiaozi\" were originally referred to as \"tender ears\" () because they were used to treat frostbitten ears. Zhang Zhongjing was on his way home during wintertime, when he found many common people had frostbitten ears, because they did not have warm clothes and sufficient food. He treated these poor people by stewing lamb, black pepper, and some warming medicines in a pot, chopped them, and used them to fill small dough wrappers. He boiled these dumplings and gave them with the broth to his patients, until the coming of the Chinese New Year. In order to celebrate the New Year as well as recovering from frostbitten ears, people imitated Zhang's recipe to make \"Jiao'er\".\nOther theories suggest that \"jiaozi\" may have derived from dumplings in Western Asia. In the Western Han dynasty (206 BC \u2013 AD 9) \"jiaozi\" () were called \"jiaozi\" (). During the Three Kingdoms period (AD 220\u2013280), the book \"Guangya\" by Zhang Yi mentions \"jiaozi\". Yan Zhitui during the Northern Qi dynasty (AD 550\u2013577) wrote: \"Today the \"jiaozi\", shaped like a crescent moon, is a common food in the world.\" Six Dynasties Turfan tombs contained dumplings. Later in the Tang dynasty (AD 618\u2013907), \"jiaozi\" become more popular, called \"Bian Shi\" (). Chinese archaeologists have found a bowl of \"jiaozi\" in the Tang dynasty tombs in Turpan.7th or 8th century dumplings and wontons were found in Turfan.\n\"Jiaozi\" may also be named because they are horn-shaped. The Chinese word for \"horn\" is \"jiao\" (), and \"jiaozi\" was originally written with the Chinese character for \"horn\", but later it was replaced by the specific character , which has the food radical on the left and the phonetic component \"\" () on the right.\nAt the same time, \"jiaozi\" look like \"yuan bao\" silver or gold ingots used as currency during the Ming dynasty, and as the name sounds like the word for the earliest paper money, serving them is believed to bring prosperity. Many families eat these at midnight on Chinese New Year's Eve. Some cooks will even hide a clean coin inside a \"jiaozi\" for the lucky to find.\nNowadays, \"jiaozi\" are eaten year-round, and can be eaten for breakfast, lunch or dinner. They can be served as an appetizer, a side dish, or as the main course. In China, sometimes \"jiaozi\" is served as a last course during restaurant meals. As a breakfast dish, \"jiaozi\" are prepared alongside \"xiaolongbao\" at inexpensive roadside restaurants. Typically, they are served in small steamers containing ten pieces each. Although mainly serving \"jiaozi\" to breakfast customers, these small restaurants keep them hot on steamers and ready to eat all day. \"Jiaozi\" are always served with a dipping sauce that may include vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, ginger, rice wine, hot sauce, and sesame oil. They can also be served with soup.\nTypes.\nChinese dumplings \"(jiaozi)\" may be divided into various types depending on how they are cooked:\nDumplings that use egg rather than dough to wrap the filling are called \"egg dumplings\" ().\nPan-fried dumplings can be joined together by a brown, crispy lattice base created by pouring a flour and water mix into the pan at the end of cooking. In Chinese, this is known as \"frost\" or \"ice crystal\" (\u51b0\u82b1). The dumplings can also be joined together with an egg base which is topped with green onion and sesame seeds.\nFillings.\nCommon dumpling meat fillings include chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, and fish which are usually mixed with chopped vegetables. Popular vegetable fillings include napa cabbage, scallion (spring onions), celery, leek, spinach, mushroom, carrot, garlic chives, and edible black fungus.\nFolding technique.\nThere are many ways to fold \"jiaozi\". Basically, steps for folding the skin includes putting a single pleat in the middle, putting multiple pleats along the edge, making a wavy edge like a pie crust, turning a pleated edge in toward the body resulting in a rounded edge, and putting both ends together resulting in a round shape. Different shapes of Jiaozi require different folding techniques, but the most famous and common technique is the pinched-edge fold. Take a wrapper and put one tablespoon of filling into the center of the wrapper. Fold a half of edge to the other half. Use left thumb and forefinger to pinch one side of the half-moon wrapper, and then use right thumb to push the inside skin outward, right forefinger to make outside skin into small pleats. Use right thumb to clench those pleats. Repeat these steps to the other side of the wrapper, and make sure to clench the seal of Jiaozi. This is crescent-shaped \"jiaozi\", the most popular shape in China.\nVariations.\nGuangdong.\nJiaozi is called gaau ji in Cantonese and are standard fare in Guangdong style dim sum. The immediate noted difference to Northern style is that they are smaller and wrapped in a thinner translucent skin, and usually steamed. The smaller size and the thinner wrapper make the dumplings easier to cook through with steaming. In contrast to \"jiaozi\", Guangdong \"gaau ji\" are rarely home-made because the wrapper, which needs to be thin but tough enough to not break, is more difficult to make. Many types of fillings exist, with the most common type being har gow (), but fillings can include scallop, chicken, tofu, and mixed vegetables; dim sum restaurants often feature their own house specials or innovations. Dim sum chefs and artists often use ingredients in new or creative ways, or draw inspiration from other Chinese culinary traditions, such as Chaozhou, Hakka, or Shanghai. More creative chefs may even create fusion \"gaau ji\" by using elements from other cultures, such as Japanese (teriyaki) or Southeast Asian (satay or curry), while upscale restaurants may use expensive or exotic ingredients such as lobster, shark fin and bird's nest.\nAnother Cantonese dumpling is yau gok (), which are made with glutinous rice dough and deep fried.\nGuotie.\nGuotie () are a northern Chinese style dumpling popular as a street food, appetizer, or side order in Chinese cuisine. Guotie differs from pan fried dumplings, or jianjiao, in that the shape of guotie is usually elongated and the two ends are often left open. Guotie is sometimes served on a dim sum menu, but may be offered independently. The filling for both guotie and jianjiao usually contains pork (sometimes chicken, or beef in Muslim areas), cabbage (or Chinese cabbage and sometimes spinach), scallions (spring or green onions), ginger, Chinese rice wine or cooking wine, and sesame seed oil. In southern China, the term \"guotie\" is often used as a synonym for the typical jianjiao rather than referring to a particular variety of it.\nGy\u014dza.\nThe Japanese word \"gy\u014dza\" was derived from the Jilu Mandarin reading of , \"gi\u01ceoze\", and the Japanese word is often written using the same Chinese characters. Following the Second World War, Japanese soldiers returning from the Japanese-backed puppet state of Manchukuo in northeastern China brought home gy\u014dza recipes.\nThe prevalent differences between Japanese-style gy\u014dza and Chinese-style jiaozi are the rich garlic flavor, which is less noticeable in the Chinese version, and that gy\u014dza wrappers tend to be thinner, due to the fact that most Japanese restaurants use machine-made wrappers. In contrast, the rustic cuisine of poor Chinese immigrants shaped westerners' views that Chinese restaurant jiaozi use thicker handmade wrappers. As jiaozi vary greatly across regions within China, these differences are not as clear in the country of origin. For example, visitors will easily find thin-skinned jiaozi at restaurants in Shanghai and at street food vendors in the Hangzhou region. Gy\u014dza wrappers are actually identical to jiaozi wrappers seen in Chinese households using store-bought machine-made wrappers. Gy\u014dza are usually served with soy-based tare sauce seasoned with rice vinegar and/or chili oil (\"r\u0101yu\" in Japanese, \"l\u00e0y\u00f3u\" () in Mandarin Chinese). The most common recipe is a mixture of minced pork (sometimes chicken or beef), cabbage, Asian chives, and sesame oil, and/or garlic, and/or ginger, which is then wrapped in the thinly rolled dough skins. Gyoza share similarities with both pierogi and spring rolls and are cooked in the same fashion as pierogi, either boiled or fried.\nGy\u014dza and gy\u014dza wrappers can be found in supermarkets and restaurants throughout Japan, either frozen or ready to eat. Pan-fried gy\u014dza are sold as a side dish in many \"ramen\" and Chinese restaurants. Both the wrappers and the prepared gy\u014dza themselves are increasingly easy to find in Asian markets around the world.\nThe most popular preparation method is the pan-fried style called \"yaki-gy\u014dza\" (), in which the dumpling is first fried on one flat side, creating a crispy skin. Then, water is added and the pan sealed with a lid, until the upper part of the dumpling is steamed. This technique is what the Chinese call \"guotie\" or \"potstickers\" (see above). Other popular methods include boiling \"sui-gy\u014dza\" () and deep frying \"age-gy\u014dza\" ().\nStore-bought frozen dumplings are often prepared at home by first placing them in a pot of water, bringing it to a boil, and then transferring them to a pan with oil to fry the skin.\nMomo.\nThe Tibetan and Nepalese version is known as momo (Tibetan: \u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b\u0f58\u0f7c\u0f42\u0f0b; Nepali: \u092e\u092e). The word \"momo\" comes from a Chinese loanword, \"momo\" (\u9943\u9943), which translates to \"steamed bread\". When preparing momo, flour is filled, most commonly with ground water buffalo meat. Often, ground lamb or chicken meat is used as alternate to water buffalo meat. In Nepal there is also a vegetarian option where mixtures of potato, cheese and other vegetable items are mixed. Finely chopped onion, minced garlic, fresh minced ginger, cumin powder, salt, coriander/cilantro, etc. are added to the meat for flavouring. A sauce made from cooked tomatoes flavored with Sichuan pepper and minced red chilies is often served along with momo.\nThe Nepalese Momo is usually served with dipping sauces that include tomato based chutneys or sesame based sauces. Sauces can be thick or thin consistency depending on the eatery (locally called \"chutney/achhar\"), that is normally made with tomato as the base ingredient. In Kathmandu valley, the traditional way of serving momo (momocha) is 10 ping-pong ball sized round momo drowned in a Tangy, Tomatoey and Nutty broth / sauce called Jhol (Watery Soup / Broth in Nepali) Achar (served at room temperature, with watery / runny consistency, also known as Kathmandu style momo). Jhol momo in the other hand has warmed-up / hot broth poured over momo (not cooked in the soup / broth). To make the Jhol achar one of the main ingredients is Nepali Hog Plum (Lapsi), but if unavailable, lemon / lime juice can be used.\nJiaozi and wonton.\nJiaozi should not be confused with wonton. Jiaozi have a thicker skin and a relatively flatter, more oblate, double-saucer like shape, and are usually eaten with a soy-vinegar dipping sauce (and/or hot chili sauce), while wontons have thinner skin and are usually served in broth. The dough for the jiaozi and wonton wrappers also consist of different ingredients."}
{"title": "Pea_protein", "label": "Food", "text": " \nPea protein is a type of food. It is a source of protein derived and extracted in powder from the yellow and green split peas, \"Pisum sativum,\" classified in the legume food group. It can be used as a supplement to increase an individual's protein or other nutrient intake, or as a substitute for other food products (e.g. the substitution of dairy milk by pea milk). It is also used as a functional ingredient in food-manufacturing, such as a thickener, foaming agent, or an emulsifier.\nIt is extracted in a powder form and can be processed and produced in different ways:\nPea protein is a beneficial food source due to its low allergenicity, availability, and high nutritional value. It can also help increase muscle mass, contribute to weight-loss, and it is a more environmentally friendly source of protein.\nPea protein is criticized for its effects on digestion, taste, and high sodium content. Depending on the method of processing, pea protein can contain certain levels of trypsin inhibitors, phytates, and lectins, which can cause negative side effects such as reduced nutrient uptake and intestinal damage.\nComposition.\nPea protein is rich in nutrients such as protein and carbohydrates. Pea protein also contains various important vitamins and minerals and is low in fat. While generally rich in protein, the actual protein content of peas is not always consistent.\u00a0 It is variable and influenced by both genetic factors and environmental factors (such as soil and climate in which the peas are cultivated).\nPea protein contains all essential amino acids to meet human dietary needs.\nTypically, peas contain 23.1\u201330.9% protein,1.5\u20132.0% fat, and minor constituents such as vitamins, phytic acid, saponins, polyphenols, minerals, and oxalates. They also contain several classes of protein: globulin, albumin, prolamin, and glutelin. The proteins are mainly albumins and globulins, which account for 10-20% and 70-80% of the protein in the pea seed, respectively. The albumins are water soluble and considered the metabolic and enzymatic proteins, while the globulins are salt soluble and act as the storage proteins for the seed. Globulins can be further classified into legumin and vicilin, which belong to the 11S and 7S seed storage protein classes, respectively. Legumin is a hexameric protein, and vicilin proteins are trimers.\nPea seeds contain 60-65% carbohydrates mainly composed of oligosaccharides, monosaccharides, polysaccharides, and disaccharides. The major carbohydrate fraction in peas is starch, which is the major storage carbohydrate in the cotyledons.\nPeas also contain high levels of dietary fibre, which consists of cellulose, gums, hemicellulose, pectin, mucilage, lignin, and resistant starches. Dry pea has 17-27% dietary fibre depending on their cultivar, environment, and global growing region.\nIn terms of sugars, pea seeds contain 5-6% sucrose and raffinose. Sucrose ranges from 2.2% to 2.6%, whereas oligosaccharides, such as stachyose have a range of 1.3-3.2%, verbascose 1.2-4.0%, and raffinose 0.2-1.0% depending on cultivar and environment. The fat content of pea seeds ranges from 1.2% to 1.8% depending on the cultivar and about 25% of fatty acids are composed of oleic acid (18:1) and 50% of linoleic acid (18:2).\nPea seeds are also a rich source of minerals and vitamins. They contain high levels of the following:\nIn addition, peas are a rich source of folic acid, riboflavin, pyridoxine, niacin, pyridoxamine and pyridoxal.\nUses.\nDietary supplement.\nThe nutritional qualities contained in pea proteins can be used to supplement people with certain deficiencies, or people seeking to enrich their diet with nutrients. Peas are an excellent source of proteins, carbohydrates, dietary fibre, minerals, vitamins, and phytochemicals. For example, pea protein can balance iron intake as it is high in iron. In general, they contain over five milligrams per serve, a quarter of the recommended daily iron intake for adults.\nDietary substitute.\nPea protein can be used as a protein substitute for those who cannot consume other sources as it is not derived from any of the most common allergenic foods (wheat, peanuts, eggs, soy, fish, shellfish, tree nuts, and milk). It may be used in baked goods or other cooking applications to replace common allergens. It is also processed industrially to form food products and alternative proteins such as alternative meat products, and non-dairy products. Manufacturers of alternatives include Ripple Foods, who produce a dairy alternative pea milk. Pea protein is also used in meat-alternatives such as Gardein and Beyond Meat, and egg alternatives such as Just Mayo.\nFunctional ingredient.\nPea protein is also used as a low-cost functional ingredient in food manufacturing to improve the nutritional value and texture of food products. They can also optimize the viscosity, emulsification, gelation, stability, or fat-binding properties of food. For example, The capacity of pea protein to form stable foams is an important property in cakes, souffles, whipped toppings, fudges, etc.\nProduction.\nThe manufacturing process of pea protein concentrates and isolates consists of protein extraction, purification, and drying. The industrial production of pea protein begins with the steps of cleaning and splitting the pea crop and then processing them further.\n\"The cleaning process:\" Cleaning uses equipment such as indent cleaners, which are used to remove impurities. This process ensures that any allergens, such as wheat, barley and other seeds are removed, as these products contain gluten. If not removed, it would affect its classification as a gluten-free product.\n\"The splitting process:\" Following cleaning, the pea is split and \"dehulled\" using a dehuller. The dehullers are a device that splits the pea seed and extracts the part of the whole seed which is the hull.\n\"Further processing:\" Following the splitting process, the split peas are further processed either into starch, protein, and flour fractions.\nPea protein can be produced using two methods:\nWet fractionation method.\nThe wet fractionation method is used to produce pea protein isolates. Pea protein isolates generally contain a higher concentration of protein than pea protein concentrates. It involves the extraction of the protein at an alkaline pH. An alkaline pH is usually between pH 9.5-10.5. During the extraction of the protein, it is dispersed in water so that other components of the pea, such as carbohydrates, are also extracted via ultrafiltration or iso-electric precipitation. Isoelectric precipitation is where the dissolved proteins are precipitated out of the aqueous phase and separated in a decanter. This stage occurs at a pH of 4.0-5.0. The protein is separated from the by-products in a hydroclone. The precipitated protein (curd) is separated from the supernatant (whey) by filtration or centrifugation. The curd must be washed in order to remove residues of whey solubles. Subsequently, the pH is neutralised and readjusted to 7, and a dry protein isolate is obtained with a final mechanical drying step, called spray-drying.\nDry fractionation method.\nThe dry fractionation method is used to produce pea protein concentrates. It \u00a0involves dry milling technology; a traditional mechanical process used to reduce the particle size of split or whole peas into coarse or fine flours. The outer shell of the pea is first dehulled, which is then milled via impact or jet milling to produce a flour. This process relies on differential particle size and density within the milled flour. Once milled, air classification is used, to separate the smaller protein-rich fragments from larger starch-rich granules or fibre-rich particles. During this process, an air flow fluidizes the milled flour in a separation chamber. A classifier wheel submerged in the bed selects the small particles and allows these to form the fine fraction. Larger particles are rejected by the classifier wheel, leave the chamber at the bottom, and make up the coarse fraction. Dry fractionation is a more sustainable method of processing as it does not require the use of water and energy is not required to dry the protein.\nBenefits.\nHealth.\nThe health benefits derived from pea protein are mainly from the concentration and properties of starch, protein, fibre, vitamins, minerals and phytochemicals in peas.\nPea protein is high in fibre, which aids in mediating glycaemic response, and is able to help prevent cardiovascular disease and reduce blood pressure by decreasing the levels of cholesterol and post-brandial triglyceride in humans. Studies have found the intake of pea protein to reduce blood pressure in hypertensive rats and humans. It can also be used for the prevention and control of diabetes as it has minimal effect on blood glucose levels and insulin response. Due to its high fibre content, pea protein has a 94% rate of digestibility, which minimises stomach and gastrointestinal digestion issues, such as flatulence, and discomfort from bloating. Its starch content also aids digestibility as it is attributed to the nonavailability to amylases of starch granules enclosed in intact cell wall structures, the presence of anti-nutrients such as amylase inhibitors, phytates and phenolics.\nPea proteins also contain high levels of folate. This can help increase dietary folate levels, which is beneficial for people with anaemia and neural tube defects. It also contains phenolic compounds, which are natural antioxidants that may help protect against diseases such as cancer and various inflammatory-related diseases.\nThe amino acid profile of pea protein is also beneficial. It is high in lysine, which helps to convert fatty acids into energy, and is important for the health of connective tissue. It is a great source of arginine, which promotes healthy blood flow and heart health, as well as leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which promote muscle growth.\nMuscle mass.\nPea protein can be used as a protein supplement to increase muscle mass. Increasing protein intake creates a positive acute postprandial muscle protein synthesis response and may create a positive long-term improvement in lean mass. Pea proteins also contain branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) leucine, isoleucine, and valine, which helps to promote muscle growth.\nOne study, involving a 12-week experiment on protein supplementation before and after resistance training, found that the consumption of pea protein promoted an increase in muscle mass, specifically in biceps brachii thickness.\nWeight loss.\nPea proteins are also beneficial for weight loss. Pea proteins digest more slowly, which has a satiating effect and reduces hunger, which can contribute to weight loss. The appetite-suppressing effects of peas may be related to high amounts of protein and dietary fibre, which may delay gastric emptying, attenuate glucose absorption and concentration and stimulate the release of appetite-regulating hormones.\nEnvironmental impact.\nWhen compared to the extraction of other proteins such as whey and soy, the production of pea protein utilises fewer resources which can impact the environment, such as the use of water and fertilizers. Pea proteins require less water in their production and extraction process, making pea proteins a more environmentally sustainable food source than its counterparts. One study found that one kilogram of animal protein can only be obtained by feeding six kilograms of plant protein. Another study found that the water footprint per gram of protein for eggs, chicken meat, and milk is 1.5 times larger than for peas. In the case of beef, the water footprint per gram of protein is six times larger than for peas.\nCriticisms.\nTaste.\nPea proteins have also been criticised for their taste, as they contain a compound called saponins, which can produce a bitter and metallic taste.\nTexture.\nDepending on the method of processing, pea protein can have a gritty texture.\nComposition.\nDepending on the method of processing, some pea proteins can contain high levels of anti-nutritional properties such as phytates, lectins, and trypsin inhibitors, which have negative side effects. Saponins and phytates may exhibit hypocholesterolaemic and anticarcinogenic activities. Trypsin inhibitors decrease the digestion of the protein. Lectins can impede the uptake of glucose, decrease nutrient transport, and create damage to the mucosal layer of the intestines by binding to carbohydrate molecules. Phytates affect the bioavailability and digestibility of the protein by forming complexes with essential dietary minerals such as Iron, Zinc, and Calcium, affecting their absorption."}
{"title": "Ketupat", "label": "Food", "text": "Ketupat (in Indonesian and Malay), kupat (in Javanese and Sundanese) or tipat (in Balinese) is a Javanese rice cake packed inside a diamond-shaped container of woven palm leaf pouch, Originating in Indonesia, it is also found in Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and southern Thailand. It is commonly described as \"packed rice\", although there are other types of similar packed rice such as \"lontong\" and \"bakchang\".\n\"Ketupat\" is cut open and its skin (woven palm leaf) removed. The inner rice cake is cut in pieces and served as a staple food in place of plain steamed rice. It is usually eaten with \"rendang\", \"opor ayam\", \"sayur labu\" (chayote soup), or \"sambal goreng hati\" (liver in sambal), or served as an accompaniment to satay (chicken or beef or lamb in skewers) or \"gado-gado\" (mixed vegetables with peanut sauce). Ketupat is also the main element of certain dishes such as \"ketupat sayur\" (ketupat in chayote soup with tofu and boiled egg) and \"kupat tahu\" (ketupat and tofu in peanut sauce).\n\"Ketupat\" is related to similar dishes in other rice-farming Austronesian cultures, like the Filipino \"puso\" or Patupat, although the latter is not restricted to diamond shapes and traditionally come in various intricately woven designs ranging from star-like to animal-shaped. An octahedron-shaped version called \"katupat\" was also found in pre-colonial Guam and the Mariana Islands, before the ancient rice cultivation in the island was replaced by corn brought by the Spanish.\nHistory.\nThe use of woven young palm leaves (\"janur\") fronds as a pouch to cook food is widespread in Maritime Southeast Asia, from Java, Indonesia to Malaysia, Singapore, and the Philippines. Ketupat is made from rice that has been wrapped in a woven palm leaf pouch and boiled. As the rice cooks, the grains expand to fill the pouch and the rice becomes compressed. This method of cooking gives the \"ketupat\" its characteristic form and texture of a rice cake. \nKetupat was first introduced by an Indonesian theologian named Sunan Kalijaga who was an important figure for Muslims in Java. In Java and most of Indonesia, ketupat is linked to Islamic tradition of \"lebaran\" (Eid ul-Fitr). The earliest connection of ketupat with Islamic \"lebaran\" tradition is believed to be originated in 15th-century Sultanate of Demak.\nAccording to Javanese traditions, the Indonesian \"lebaran\" tradition was first started when Sunan Bonang, one of Wali Songo of Tuban in 15th-century Java, calls for the Muslims to elevate the perfection of their Ramadhan fast by asking forgiveness and forgiving others' wrongdoings. The tradition on preparing and consuming ketupat or \"kupat\" in Javanese language during lebaran was introduced by Raden Mas Sahid or Sunan Kalijaga, one of Wali Songo (nine Muslim saints) that spread Islam in Java. Sunan Kalijaga introduced the \"lebaran ketupat\" ritual on 8 Shawwal, a week after Eid ul-Fitr and a day after a six-day Shawwal fast. It is believed that it contains appropriate symbolism; \"kupat\" means \"ngaku lepat\" or \"admitting one's mistakes\" in Javanese language, in accordance to asking for forgiveness tradition during lebaran. The crossed weaving of palm leaves symbolises mistakes and sins committed by human beings, and the inner whitish rice cake symbolise purity and deliverance from sins after observing Ramadhan fast, prayer and rituals. \nOther than Java, the tradition on consuming ketupat during Eid ul-Fitr is also can be found throughout Indonesia; from Sumatra, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Nusa Tenggara, and also neighboring countries, including Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei. \"ketupat\" has also been used as \"sajen\" (an offering for dead ancestors) for centuries. People hang a bunch of \"ketupat\" (usually \"banten\" style) at the door to treat the spirit of the ancestors they believe would come back to visit. \nLocal stories passed down through the generations have attributed the creation of this style of rice preparation to the seafarers' need to keep cooked rice from spoiling during long sea voyages. The coco leaves used in wrapping the rice are always shaped into a triangular or diamond form and stored hanging in bunches in the open air. The shape of the package facilitates moisture to drip away from the cooked rice while the coco leaves allow the rice to be aerated and at the same time prevent flies and insects from touching it.\nDespite its current association with Muslim festival of \"lebaran\", ketupat is also known in non-Muslim communities, such as Hindu Balinese and people of the Philippines, which suggested that the weaving of coconut fronds has pre-Islamic origin. It was linked to the local Hindu ritual on venerating Dewi Sri, the Javanese goddess of rice. The Balinese Hindus still weaved the \"Cili\" fronds effigy of Dewi Sri as an offering, as well as weaving \"tipat\" fronds during \"Kuningan\" Balinese Hindu holy day.\nCultural significance.\nIn various places in Indonesia, there is a ceremony called \"Lebaran Ketupat\", which is observed after the conclusion of an extra six days of fasting following Idul Fitri. In Lombok, West Nusa Tenggara, thousands of Muslims celebrated \"Lebaran Ketupat\"\u2014or \"Lebaran Topat\" as it is locally called\u2014by visiting the graves of Muslim ulamas before partaking in communal ceremonial activities, which includes music performances, ketupat cooking competitions, to shared meals where ketupat was served as the main dish. Side dishes at the events varied, ranging from \"plecing kangkung\" (stir-fried water spinach) to the local dish of \"Ayam Taliwang\". \nIn Central Java, \"Lebaran Ketupat\" is called \"Bada Kupat\", and was celebrated by cooking and serving ketupat and lepet (steamed sticky rice cooked in plaited palm leaves) in Semarang. In Colo, Kudus Regency, a parade of \"gunungan\" (cone-shape offering) made of ketupat, \"lepet\" and other food items on the slope of Mount Muria near the grave of noted Muslim preacher Sunan Muria, was held to celebrate \"Bada Kupat\", while on the slope of Mount Merapi in Boyolali Regency, the celebration featured a parade of livestock decorated with ketupat.\nAmong Hindu communities in Bali and Banyuwangi in East Java, ketupat is part of the offering and ritual of Kuningan festive celebration to conclude the Galungan holy days. During Galungan, Hindu families create and erect a \"penjor\" pole made of \"janur\" (young palm leaves), and then make some offerings to the Pura. Ten days after Galungan, the ceremony of Kuningan is observed to conclude the religious holy days. To celebrate Kuningan, Balinese Hindu families make \"tipat\" or ketupat first as offering, and then they consume some ketupat afterwards.\nThere are some striking similarities between Javanese Muslim \"Lebaran\" and Balinese Hindu \"Galungan-Kuningan\" holy days, of which ketupat is one. For example, the families pay a visit to the grave of their family or ancestors prior of observing the holy day, and they consume ketupat to conclude the religious festival. Although today in contemporary Indonesia, ketupat is strongly associated with Muslim celebration of Idul Fitri, this parallel phenomenon suggested the pre-Islamic native origin of ketupat, as Native Indonesian ways to shows gratitude and to celebrate festivities by making and consuming certain kind of food.\nVarieties.\nThere are many varieties of \"ketupat\", with two of the more common ones being \"ketupat nasi\" and \"ketupat pulut\". \"Ketupat nasi\" is made from common white rice and is wrapped in a square shape with coconut palm leaves while \"ketupat pulut\" is made from glutinous rice is usually wrapped in a triangular shape using the leaves of the fan palm (\"Licuala\"). \"Ketupat pulut\" is also called \"ketupat daun palas\" in Malaysia, primarily found in northern Malay Peninsula and among the Malay community of southern Thailand. Usually ketupat pouch are made from \"janur\" or young palm leaves fronds. However, in Kalimantan, nipah leaves might be used and woven into ketupat as well.\n\"Ketupat\" is also traditionally served by Indonesian and Malays at open houses on festive occasions such as lebaran or Idul Fitri (Hari Raya Aidilfitri). During Idul Fitri in Indonesia, \"ketupat\" is often served with either \"opor ayam\" (chicken in coconut milk), chicken or beef curry, \"rendang\", \"sambal goreng ati\" (spicy beef liver), \"krechek\" (buffalo or beef skin dish), or \"sayur labu Siam\" (chayote soup). Ketupat or \"lontong\" is also used as the replacement of plain steamed rice in \"gado-gado, karedok\", or \"pecel\".\nDerivative dishes.\nOther than replacing steamed rice or \"lontong\" in certain dishes, such as satay, \"gado-gado\", and \"ketoprak\", ketupat is also forming the essential part of other derivative dishes with certain recipes developed from it.\nKetupat sayur.\nOne of popular street food in Indonesian cities is \"Ketupat sayur\" which literary means \"ketupat in vegetables soup\". \"Ketupat sayur\" is known in two popular versions; the Betawi version from Jakarta and \"katupek sayua\" the Padang version from West Sumatra. Ketupat sayur is popular as breakfast fare in Jakarta and Padang. It consist of ketupat served with sliced \"labu siam\" (chayote) and unripe jackfruit \"gulai\" in thin and spicy coconut milk soup, topped with cooked tofu and \"telur pindang\" (spiced boiled egg), and \"krupuk\" crackers. The Padang or Minangkabau version might be served with additional dishes, such as egg balado, rendang and various gulai. If \"lontong\" was used in the identical recipe, it is called \"lontong sayur\" instead.\nKupat tahu.\nKetupat also used as main ingredient in Sundanese and Javanese dish \"kupat tahu\", which is ketupat, \"tahu goreng\" (fried tofu), and bean sprouts served in peanut sauce topped with crispy \"krupuk\" crackers. Popular variants of \"kupat tahu\" includes \"Kupat tahu Kuningan\" from Kuningan Regency in West Java, \"Kupat Tahu Magelang\" from Magelang Regency, Central Java, and \"Kupat tahu Gempol\" from Surabaya, East Java.\nTipat cantok.\nIts Balinese version is called \"tipat cantok\", which is sliced ketupat with boiled or blanched vegetables; asparagus bean, water spinach, bean sprout, cucumber, and fried tofu mixed in peanut sauce which is made from ground fried peanuts, garlic, chili pepper, salt and tauco fermented soy paste. The peanut sauce might be mild or hot and spicy, depends on the addition of chili pepper. It is one of a few Balinese vegetarian dish. Tipat cantok is akin to Javanese pecel and Jakartan gado-gado.\nOther uses.\nIn Hindu-majority Bali, ketupat is used as one of the temple offerings. In Java, among traditional Muslim abangan community, the woven empty or uncooked ketupat skin is often hung as an amulet to symbolise wealth and prosperity.\nBecause in Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Thailand, Singapore and Brunei ketupat is strongly linked to Islamic Eid ul-Fitr, it is also used there as decorations. The empty ketupat skin woven from colourful ribbons are used as decorations to signify this festive occasions, in the same fashions as bells to signify Christmas. Colorful ribbon ketupat are often used to decorate shopping malls, offices, or as decorations of gift parcels.\nSimilar dishes.\nIn the Philippines, similar rice pouches are known as \"puso\" (literally \"heart\") and had their origins from pre-colonial animistic ritual offerings as recorded by Spanish historians. Unlike \"ketupat\", however, they are not restricted to diamond shapes and can come in a wide variety of weaving styles which still survive among various ethnic groups in the Philippines today. \"Ketupat\" are also woven differently, the leaf base and the loose leaf strands do not exit at the same point, as in most Filipino \"puso\". \"Ketupat\" somewhat resemble the \"tamu pinad\" version among Muslim Filipinos the most, which are shaped like a flattened diamond, although they are also woven differently. Patupat, despite having the same form, is cooked differently. Patupat is cooked in sugarcane juice.\nIn Cambodia, a similar dish of pounded sticky rice wrapped in a pentagonal woven palm leaves is called \"katom\" (\u1780\u17b6\u178f\u17c6) in Khmer. It is a non-traditional variant of \"num kom\" which uses banana leaves instead of palm. In Indonesia, similar dish of compressed rice in leaf container includes \"lepet, lontong\", \"lemper\", \"arem-arem\" and \"bacang\".\nIn China, there is a similar dish called \"lap\" (\u82d9) that is a local speciality of the island of Hainan. Hainanese \"lap\" is usually bigger in size than Malay \"ketupat\". \"Lap\" skin might be woven into pillow-shaped or triangular, the sticky rice is filled with pork belly. Outside China, \"lap\" can also can be found in Port Dickson in Malaysia and Singapore."}
{"title": "Burrito", "label": "Food", "text": "A burrito (, ) is a dish in Mexican and Tex-Mex cuisine that took form in California cuisine, consisting of a flour tortilla wrapped into a sealed cylindrical shape around various ingredients. The tortilla is sometimes lightly grilled or steamed to soften it, make it more pliable, and allow it to adhere to itself. Burritos are often eaten by hand, as their tight wrapping keeps the ingredients together. Burritos can also be served \"wet\", i.e., covered in a savory and spicy sauce, when they would be eaten with a fork and knife.\nBurritos are filled with savory ingredients, most often a meat such as beef, chicken, or pork, and often include other ingredients, such as rice, cooked beans (either whole or refried), vegetables, such as lettuce and tomatoes, cheese, and condiments such as salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole, or crema.\nBurritos are often contrasted with similar dishes, such as tacos, in which a small hand-sized tortilla is folded in half around the ingredients rather than wrapped and sealed, or with enchiladas, which use corn masa tortillas, and are covered in a savory sauce, to be eaten with a fork and knife.\nEtymology.\nThe word \"burrito\" means \"little donkey\" in Spanish, the diminutive form of \"burro\", or \"donkey\". The name \"burrito\", as applied to the dish, possibly derives from the tendency for burritos to contain a lot of different things similar to how a donkey would be able to carry a large burden.\nHistory.\nBefore the development of the modern burrito, the Maya civilization of Mexico used corn tortillas as early as 1500 B.C. to wrap foods, with fillings of chili peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, squash, and avocados. Historically, the Pueblo peoples of the Southwestern US also made tortillas filled with beans and meat sauce and prepared much like the modern burrito. But these preparations could also be said to be the origin of the simpler taco, rather than the modern burrito.\nThe precise origin of the modern burrito is not known. In the 1895 by Feliz Ramos i Duarte, the burrito or taco was identified as a regional item from the Mexican state of Guanajuato and defined as \"\" (A rolled tortilla with meat or other ingredients inside, called \" in Yucat\u00e1n and \" in the city of Cuernavaca and in Mexico City). Some have speculated that it may have originated with \"vaqueros,\" the cowboys of northern Mexico in the 19th century.\nAn often repeated piece of folk history is the story of a man named Juan M\u00e9ndez who sold tacos at a street stand in the Bella Vista neighborhood of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez during the Mexican Revolution period (1910\u20131921), while using a donkey as a transport for himself and his food. To keep the food warm, M\u00e9ndez wrapped it in large homemade flour tortillas underneath a small tablecloth. As the \"food of the \"burrito\"\" (i.e., \"food of the little donkey\") grew in popularity, \"burrito\" was eventually adopted as the name for these large tacos.\nAnother origin story tells of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez in the 1940s, where a street food vendor created the tortilla-wrapped food to sell to poor children at a state-run middle school. The vendor would call the children his \"burritos\", because \"burro\" is a colloquial term for a \"dunce\" or \"dullard\". Eventually, the somewhat derogatory but endearing term for the children was transferred to the food that they ate.\nIn 1923, Alejandro Borquez opened the Sonora Cafe in Los Angeles that later changed its name to El Cholo Spanish Cafe. Burritos first appeared on American restaurant menus at the El Cholo Spanish Cafe in Los Angeles during the 1930s. Burritos were mentioned in the U.S. media for the first time in 1934, appearing in the \"Mexican Cookbook\", a collection of regional recipes from New Mexico that was written by historian Erna Fergusson. In 1956, a frozen burrito was developed in Southern California.\nDevelopment of regional varieties.\nMexico.\nBurritos are a traditional food of Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, a city bordering El Paso, Texas, in the northern Mexican state of Chihuahua, where people buy them at restaurants and roadside stands. Northern Mexican border towns like Villa Ahumada have an established reputation for serving burritos. Authentic Mexican burritos are usually small and thin, with flour tortillas containing only one or two of several ingredients: either some form of meat or fish, potato, rice, beans, asadero cheese, , or \"chile relleno\". Other ingredients may include: \"barbacoa\", \"mole\", refried beans and cheese (a \"bean and cheese\" burrito), or (shredded slow-cooked flank steak). The burrito has a variation with \"chile \" (mild to moderately hot) and one with \"salsa verde\" (very hot). The Mexican burrito may be a northern variation of the traditional , which is eaten for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.\nAlthough burritos are one of the most popular examples of Mexican cuisine outside of Mexico, they are only popular in the northern part of Mexico. However, they are beginning to appear in some nontraditional venues in other parts of Mexico. Wheat flour tortillas (used in burritos) are now often seen throughout much of Mexico (possibly due to these areas being less than optimal for growing maize or corn), despite at one time being particular to northwestern Mexico, the Southwestern US Mexican-American community, and Pueblo Indian tribes.\nBurritos are commonly called (\"wheat flour tacos\") in Central Mexico and Southern Mexico, and (the feminine variation with 'a') in \"northern-style\" restaurants outside of northern Mexico proper. A long and thin fried burrito called a \",\" which is similar to a chimichanga, is prepared in the state of Sonora and vicinity.\nA variation of the burrito found in the Mexican state of Sonora is known as the burro percher\u00f3n.\nSan Francisco Mission burrito.\nThe origins of the Mission burrito or Mission-style burrito can be traced back to San Francisco, in the Mission District taquer\u00edas of the 1960s and 1970s. This type of burrito is produced on a steam table assembly line, and is characterized by a large stuffed flour tortilla wrapped in aluminum foil, and may include fillings such as carne asada (beef), Mexican-style rice, whole beans (not ), sour cream and onion.\nFebronio Ontiveros claims to have offered the first retail burrito in San Francisco in 1961 at (\"The Lighthouse\"), a corner grocery store on Folsom Street. Ontiveros claims credit for inventing the \"super burrito\", a style which may have led to the early development of the \"San Francisco style\". This innovative style involves the addition of rice, sour cream and guacamole to the standard burrito of meat, beans, and cheese. The Mission burrito emerged as a regional culinary movement during the 1970s and 1980s. The popularity of San Francisco-style burritos has grown locally at Mission Street taquerias like , and nationally at chains like Chipotle Mexican Grill, Illegal Pete's, Chevy's Fresh Mex, Freebirds World Burrito, Qdoba, and Barberitos. Chili's had a brief stint with \"Fresh Mex\" foods and burritos between 2015 and 2017. In 1995, World Wrapps opened in San Francisco's Marina District and brought a burrito-inspired wrap style to the restaurant industry.\nSan Diego.\nSan Diego-style burritos include \"California burritos\" and carne asada burritos. The style has been described by food writers as an \"austere meal of meat, cheese and salsa\", a contrast to the Mission-style burrito, which is typically larger and always contains more ingredients. A significant subgroup of Mexican restaurants in San Diego serves burritos described as \"no-frills\" and, in contrast to Mission-style burritos, the assembly line is not used.\nIn the early 1960s, Roberto Robledo opened a \"tortilleria\" in San Diego and learned the restaurant business. Robledo began selling small bean burritos (or ) at in the late 1960s, and by 1970, he had established the first Roberto's Taco Shop. By 1999, Roberto's restaurants had expanded to a chain of 60 taco shops offering fresh burritos known for their distinctive quality. Hoping to draw on the prestige of Roberto's, new taco shops in San Diego began using the \"-bertos\" suffix, with names like Alberto's, Filiberto's, Hilberto's, and others.\nThe California burrito originated at an unknown -berto's named restaurant in San Diego in the 1980s. The Fresh MXN chain (formerly Santana's) also claimed to be the originator of the California burrito. The earliest-known published mention was in a 1995 article in the \"Albuquerque Tribune\". The California burrito typically consists of chunks of carne asada meat, French fries, cheese, and either cilantro, pico de gallo, sour cream, onion, or guacamole (or some combination of these five). The ingredients are similar to those used in the \"carne asada fries\" dish, and it is considered a staple of the local cuisine of San Diego. With the merging of French fries and more traditional burrito fillings, the California burrito is an example of fusion border food. The California burrito has also been described as a \"trans-class\" food item, as it is regularly consumed by people across socioeconomic lines. Variants of this burrito may add shrimp (surf and turf), or substitute carnitas (pork) or chicken for carne asada.\nThe is considered one of the regional foods of San Diego. Carolynn Carreno has said that to San Diegans, \"carne asada burritos are as integral to the experience of the place as a slice of (pizza) pie is to a New Yorker.\" The San Diego-style carne asada burrito is served with chunks of carne asada, guacamole, and pico de gallo salsa. This \"wall-to-wall\" use of meat contrasts to burrito styles that use rice and beans as filler ingredients.\nLos Angeles.\nLos Angeles also has several unique local burrito varieties. The first is the most traditional and is exemplified by the versions at Mexican-American restaurants such as Al &amp; Bea's, Lupe's #2, and Burrito King. These restaurants have often been in existence for decades, and they offer a distinctly Americanized menu compared with the typical taqueria. The burrito of L.A. itself can take multiple forms, but is almost always dominated by some combination of: refried beans, meat (often stewed beef or chili), and cheese (usually cheddar), with rice and other ingredients typical of Mission burritos offered as add-ons, if at all.\nThe most basic version of this burrito consists of only beans and cheese; beyond this, there are the \"green chile\" and \"red chile\" burritos, which may simply mean the addition of chiles or a meatless chile sauce to the plain beans (as at Al &amp; Bea's), meat or cheese as well. Rice, again, is rarely included, which, along with the choice of chiles, is one of the style's most defining traits. The menu will then usually go on to list multiple other combinations, such as beef and bean, all-beef, a \"special\" with further ingredients, etc. If the restaurant also offers hamburgers and sandwiches, it may sell a burrito version of these, such as a \"hot dog burrito\".\nIn addition to the version described, Los Angeles is also home to three burrito styles that can be said to fall under the category of Mexican fusion cuisine. The first is the famed \"kosher burrito,\" served since 1946 at its eponymous restaurant at 1st Street and Main in Downtown Los Angeles. Another is the Korean kogi burrito, invented by American chef Roy Choi, the first to combine Mexican and Korean cuisines. The kogi burrito was named the seventh best burrito in Los Angeles in 2012 by the LA Weekly. The kogi burrito is accented with chile-soy vinaigrette, sesame oil, and fresh lime juice. Food writer Cathy Chaplin has said that \"this is what Los Angeles tastes like.\" Finally, there is the sushi burrito, most notably the version sold at the \"Jogasaki\" food truck. Wrapped in flour tortillas, \"sushi burritos\" include such fillings as spicy tuna, tempura, and cucumber.\nThe existence of such a large truly Mexican community in Los Angeles also makes it possible to find a variety of authentic burrito dishes from different regions of Mexico: from Oaxaca to Hidalgo.\nResearch.\nTaco Bell research chef Anne Albertine experimented with grilling burritos to enhance portability. This grilling technique allowed large burritos to remain sealed without spilling their contents. This is a well-known cooking technique used by some San Francisco taquerias and Northern Mexican burrito stands. Traditionally, grilled burritos are cooked on a comal (griddle).\nBean burritos, which are high in protein and low in saturated fat, have been touted for their health benefits. Black bean burritos are also a good source of dietary fiber and phytochemicals."}
{"title": "Marzipan", "label": "Food", "text": "Marzipan is a confection consisting primarily of sugar, honey, and almond meal (ground almonds), sometimes augmented with almond oil or extract.\nIt is often made into sweets; common uses are chocolate-covered marzipan and small marzipan imitations of fruits and vegetables. It can also be used in biscuits or rolled into thin sheets and glazed for icing cakes, primarily birthday cakes, wedding cakes and Christmas cakes. Marzipan paste may also be used as a baking ingredient, as in stollen or banket. In some countries, it is shaped into small figures of animals as a traditional treat for New Year's Day or Christmas. Marzipan is also used in Tortell, and in some versions of king cake eaten during the Carnival season. Traditional Swedish princess cake is typically covered with a layer of marzipan that has been tinted pale green or pink.\nAround the world.\nSouthern Europe.\nIn Spain it is a traditional Christmas dessert (mazap\u00e1n), although in Toledo, where the first written reference of this product dates back to 1512, it is eaten all year round. In Italy, particularly in Palermo, marzipan (') is often shaped and painted with food colourings to resemble fruit\u2014'\u2014especially during the Christmas season and on ' (All Souls' Day) on November 2. May 9 and 10 are also special days for eating marzipan in Sicily. In Portugal, where the confection has been traditionally made by nuns, marzipan (') is used to make fruit-shaped sweets; in the Algarve region in particular it is a very common sweet. There are other regions, as Toledo in Spain in which marzipan (') is shaped into simple animal shapes, and sometimes filled in with egg yolk (') and sugar. In Greece and Cyprus, marzipan is made in a variety of shapes and sizes and is almost always left white. In the islands of the Aegean in particular, white marzipan is considered a wedding treat and is served to guests at wedding feasts.\nIn Malta marzipan is used as a filling in the traditional Maltese Easter treats called Figolla.\nWestern and Central Europe.\nIn Belgium and the Netherlands, marzipan figures are given as Saint Nicholas's presents. In Germany, it is common to give marzipan in the shape of a loaf of bread, ', during Christmas time or shaped as small potatoes ('). Stollen can contain marzipan, and it is often featured as an ingredient in seasonal baked goods, such as Bethm\u00e4nnchen and other Christmas cookies. One traditional new year present is known as a \"\" (\"lucky pig\"). Mozartkugel from Austria are a famed export made of marzipan balls dipped in dark chocolate.\nIn the United Kingdom, celebratory fruitcakes are decorated with a layer of marzipan- particularly Christmas cake which is covered with white sugar icing, and at Easter the Simnel cake contains a layer of marzipan, a further layer decorates the top and 12 spheres symbolise the apostles of Christ- the marzipan is lightly grilled or toasted to colour it. Battenberg cake, which originates in England, is covered in a layer of marzipan.\nIn Geneva, a traditional part of the celebration of L'Escalade is the ritual smashing of a chocolate cauldron filled with marzipan vegetables, a reference to a Savoyard siege of the city which was supposedly foiled by a housewife with a cauldron of boiling soup.\nNorthern Europe.\nIn Denmark, Sweden and Norway, it is customary to snack on marzipan pigs around Christmas, marzipan shaped as eggs around Easter, and \"Kransekage\" on New Year's Eve. It is also used in a large variety of cakes and confectioneries unrelated to the holidays, including \"Tr\u00e6stammer\", \"G\u00e5sebryst\", and \"Napoleonshatte\", and as an ingredient in remonce-filling for Danish pastry.\nIn Maiasmokk caf\u00e9 in Tallinn, Estonia, there is a small museum dedicated to the history and manufacture of marzipan.\nMiddle East.\nIn Syria, marzipan (known as \"lozina\", \"\"), or Mar\u00e7ab\u00e9n (\u0645\u0631\u0635\u0628\u0627\u0646) (Arabic word derived from \"lawz\" = \"almond\") is flavoured with orange-flower water and shaped into roses and other delicate flowers before they are baked. Marzipan can also be made from oatmeal, farina, or semolina.\nFor Jews in Iran, marzipan fruit is a traditional Passover treat, replacing biscuits and cakes.\nThe Americas.\nIn Latin American cuisine, marzipan is known by the \"Spanish\" word \"mazap\u00e1n\" and is also traditionally eaten at Christmas; although, Latin American \"mazap\u00e1n\" is generally made with peanuts instead of almonds as the Spanish \"mazap\u00e1n\".\nAsia.\nIn the Indian state of Goa, marzipan (\") was introduced from Portugal. However, the Goan version uses cashew nuts instead of almonds. Goan marzipan is used to make Easter eggs. It is also used to make Christmas sweets in various shapes like fruits, flowers, stars, etc. Similarly, in the city of Bombay (Mumbai), the East Indians mould their cashewnut-based or almond-based marzipan into different shapes for Christmas and into marzipan eggs, chickens and bonnets for Easter.\nIn the Philippines marzipan was brought from Spain, \" (Spanish for \"pili marzipan\") is made from pili nuts.\nHistory.\nThere are two proposed lines of origin for marzipan; they are not necessarily contradictory and may be complementary, as there have always been Mediterranean trade and cooking influences. Other sources establish the origin of marzipan in China, from where the recipe moved on to the Middle East and then to Europe through Al-Andalus.\nNortheast Mediterranean line.\nAlthough it is believed to have been introduced to Eastern Europe through the Turks (\"badem ezmesi\" in Turkish, and most notably produced in Edirne), there is some dispute between Hungary and Italy over its origin. Marzipan became a specialty of the Hanseatic League port towns. In particular, the cities of L\u00fcbeck and Tallinn have a proud tradition of marzipan manufacture. Examples include L\u00fcbecker Marzipan (\"PGI\"). The city's manufacturers like Niederegger still guarantee their marzipan to contain two-thirds almonds by weight, which results in a product of highest quality. Historically, the city of K\u00f6nigsberg in East Prussia was also renowned for its distinctive marzipan production. K\u00f6nigsberg marzipan remains a special type of marzipan in Germany that is golden brown on its surface and sometimes embedded with marmalade at its centre.\nIberian Peninsula line.\nAnother possible geographic origin is the parts of Spain that were known as Al-Andalus. In Toledo (850-900, though more probably 1150 during the reign of Alfonso VII) this specialty was known as \"Postre Regio\" (instead of \"Mazap\u00e1n\"). There are also mentions in The Book of One Thousand and One Nights of an almond paste eaten during Ramadan and as an aphrodisiac.\nMazap\u00e1n is Toledo's most famous dessert, often created for Christmas, and has PGI status. For this, almonds have to be at least 50% of the total weight, following the directives of \"Mazap\u00e1n de Toledo\" regulator council.\nAnother idea to support this line is the important tradition of another Spanish almond-based Christmas confectionery, the \"turr\u00f3n\".\nIn the U.S., marzipan is not officially defined, but it is generally made with a higher ratio of sugar to almonds than almond paste. One brand, for instance, has 28% almonds in its marzipan, and 45% almonds in its almond paste. However, in Sweden and Finland almond paste refers to a marzipan that contains 50% ground almonds, a much higher quality than regular marzipan. In Germany, L\u00fcbecker Marzipan is known for its quality. It contains 66% almonds. The original manually produced Mozartkugeln are made from green pistachio marzipan.\nVariations.\nPersipan is a similar, yet less expensive product, in which the almonds are replaced by apricot or peach kernels. Many confectionery products sold as marzipan are made from less expensive materials, such as soy paste and almond essence. To control and detect the authenticity of marzipan, polymerase chain reaction methods can differentiate almonds from substitutes and adulterants at concentrations less than 1%. German marzipan is made by grinding whole almonds with sugar and partially drying the paste, and French marzipan (called 'massepain') is made by combining ground almonds with sugar syrup. Some marzipan is flavoured with rosewater. Spanish marzipan is made without bitter almonds. In the U.S, bitter almonds are not used in marzipan because the importation of bitter almonds into the U.S. is prohibited by U.S. law, owing to them containing a substance related to cyanide. Sugar free marzipan can be made by replacing sugar with polyols such as maltitol.\nEtymology.\nThe German name has largely ousted the original English name \"marchpane\" with the same apparent derivation: \"March bread\". (The word \"marchpane\" occurs in Shakespeare's \"Romeo and Juliet\", Act 1, Scene 5, Line 9.) \"Marzapane\" is documented earlier in Italian than in any other language, and the sense \"bread\" for \"pan\" is Romance. The origin could be from the Latin term \"martius panis\", which means \"bread of March\". However, the ultimate etymology is unclear; for example, the Italian word derives from the Latin words \"Massa\" (itself from Greek \u039c\u03ac\u03b6\u03b1 \"Maza\") meaning pastry and \"Pan\" meaning bread, this can be particularly seen in the Proven\u00e7al \"massapan\", the Portuguese \"ma\u00e7ap\u00e3o\" (where '\u00e7' is an alternative form for the phoneme 'ss') and old Spanish \"mazap\u00e1n\" \u2013 the change from 'ss' to 'z' in Latin words was common in old Spanish and the 'r' appeared later. It could also be derived from martis pan, bread of March. Among the other possible etymologies set forth in the Oxford English Dictionary, one theory proposes that the word \"marzipan\" may be a corruption of Martaban, a Burmese city famous for its jars.\nThe Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola suggests the idea of the Spanish word mazap\u00e1n to be derived from the Hispanic Arabic \u0628\u0633\u0645\u0629 pi\u010dm\u00e1\u1e6d, which is derived from the Greek \u03c0\u03b1\u03be\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd.\nAnother source could be from Arabic \u0645\u0648\u062b\u0627\u0628\u0627\u0646 \"mawth\u0101b\u0101n\" \"king who sits still\". The Arabic, Latinised as \"matapanus\", was used to describe a Venetian coin depicting an enthroned Christ the King. These coins were stored in ornate boxes. From about the fifteenth century, when the coins were no longer in circulation, the boxes became decorative containers for storing and serving luxury sweetmeats. One such luxury that crept into the box in the sixteenth century is the now-famous almond-flavoured marzipan, named (at least proximately) after the box in which it was stored.\nHowever, if marzipan has its origin in Persia, it is not unlikely that the name may come from Marzban (in Persian: \u0645\u0631\u0632\u0628\u0627\u0646, derived from the words Marz \u0645\u0631\u0632 meaning \"border\" or \"boundary\" and the suffix -b\u0101n \u0628\u0627\u0646 meaning guardian), a class of margraves or military commanders in charge of border provinces of the Sassanid Empire of Persia (Iran) between the 3rd and 7th centuries.\nProduction.\nTo produce marzipan, raw almonds are cleaned \"by sieving, air elutriation, and other electronic or mechanical devices\", then immersed in water with a temperature just below the boiling point for about five minutes, in a process known as blanching. This loosens the almonds' skin, which is removed by passing the almonds through rubber-covered rotating cylinders. They are then cooled, after which they are coarsely chopped and ground, with up to 35% sugar, into almond flour.\nThe almond flour mixture is roasted and cooled, after which sucrose (table sugar) and possibly a binding agent such as starch syrup or sorbitol are added. It may then be moulded into any shape. Marzipan must be covered in an airtight container to prevent it from hardening and dehydrating. It should be protected from direct light to prevent rancidity of almond oil, a result of lipid oxidation.\nScience.\nMolecular composition.\nThe aroma and flavor of marzipan can be attributed to benzaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide, which both derive from the benzoin condensation reaction.\nPhysical structure.\nMarzipan is a food emulsion that contains four phases: a solid phase of suspended particles including almonds and sugars, a suspended air pocket phase formed from incorporated air during mixing, a water phase, and a lipid phase from almond oil. The phases can separate when left alone for long periods of time. It is stabilized by the phospholipids and triglycerides found in the almond cells. The fatty acids found in almonds include saturated fats such as stearic acid and unsaturated fats such as linoleic acid. Emulsifiers can be added during production to increase shelf life.\nMarzipan's softness is a balance between the solid and liquid components. It should have a moisture content of less than 10%."}

{"title": "Articulata_hypothesis", "label": "Animal", "text": "The Articulata hypothesis is the grouping in a higher taxon of animals with segmented bodies, consisting of Annelida and Panarthropoda. This theory states that these groups are descended from a common segmented ancestor. The Articulata hypothesis is an alternative to the hypothesis that ecdysis (the shedding of outer cuticle) is a primitive characteristic \u2013 this would place Panarthropoda in the group Ecdysozoa.\nOrigins.\nThe Articulata hypothesis originates from the phylogenetic analyses of Georges Cuvier in his 1817 published work \"Le R\u00e8gne animal, distribu\u00e9 apr\u00e8s son organization\". In this work, Cuvier theorized that all organisms exist as a functional whole, meaning that all of the physiological structures of an organism are important for survival. By studying these physiological structures, Cuvier was able to group the known animal kingdom according to structural similarities resulting from what he referred to as special \"ground-plans\", which are analogous to blueprints. Each of these ground-plans, he further argued, evolved separately from the others and structural similarities were due to common function and not to common ancestry. From these ground-plans, Cuvier separated the known animal kingdom into four branches or \"\": Vertebrata, Articulata, Mollusca and Radiata. From this phylogenetic grouping, the Articulata hypothesis was born.\nThe Articulata hypothesis, simply stated, is the phylogenetic grouping of the phylum Annelida (which includes polychaetes, oligochaetes, and leeches) together with the phylum Arthropoda (arachnids, insects and crustaceans) into the common taxon Articulata. Cuvier grouped these diverse phyla together according to the common structural feature: the segmented body plan. This hypothesis further implies that all segmented organisms have a common ancestral origin.\nDevelopment.\nSince its original formulation in 1817, there have been significant challenges and modifications to the articulata hypothesis as new theories have been accepted (Darwin's theory of evolution) and new technologies have become available (confocal microscopy, DNA sequencing, genomics). Additionally, the discovery of Onychophora as its own phylum was incorporated into the theory by H. Bruce Bordreaux \nTheory of Evolution.\nDarwin's Theory of Evolution had a large, yet often understated impact of the articulata hypothesis. Cuvier's original Articulata hypothesis was based on his assumption that current species no longer evolved because to evolve would cause loss of integral structures necessary for the survival of the species. While the general acceptance of the theory of evolution weakened Cuvier's general theory of the unique ground-plans as the origin of modern taxa, it strengthened the articulata hypothesis by organizing annelids and arthropods into a clade descended from a common segmented ancestor.\nConfocal microscopy and modern molecular biology techniques.\nWhile each advance in modern molecular biology has shaken the phylogenetic tree of Bilateria, advances in molecular biology techniques led to further data supporting the articulata hypothesis but also led to the development of conflicting theories. Advances in confocal microscopy technology led to the discovery of embryonic cleavage patterns, which differs between the annelids and arthropods. Annelids show spiral cleavage, meaning that each embryonic cleavage occurs at progressive 90-degree angles with respect to the animal\u2013vegetal axis. Arthropods, on the other hand, display a heterogeneous mix of embryonic cleavage patterns including spiral-like cleavage and radial cleavage patterns. This led researchers to two theories: The first was that the arthropods lineage must have lost the ability to spiral cleave since differentiating from the last common ancestor between annelids and arthropods. The second is that this showed similarities between annelids and mollusks who also spirally cleaves but lacks that the segmented body plan. This was not the only interpretation of this data but other hypotheses were seen to have less data or merit. Other studies such as those looking a neural patterns within the articulata clade showed mixed patterns and thus mixed results.\nDNA sequencing and genomics.\nThe advancements in DNA sequencing techniques and the development of phylogenetic analysis algorithms led to the splitting of the articulata clade. Original phylogenetic studies on the sequences of 18S and 28S ribosomal DNA sequence led to the suggestions that the annelids and arthropods had evolutionarily diverged much earlier than was previously thought but such limited genetic studies led to limited and often mixed results. As more genes were added to the studies, it became apparent that arthropods were genetically closer to nematodes and other molting organisms whereas the annelids were closer evolutionary to mollusks. This Ecdysozoa hypothesis is generally accepted today as the best supported evolutionary hypothesis for annelids and arthropods."}
{"title": "Paracatenula", "label": "Animal", "text": "Paracatenula is a genus of millimeter sized free-living marine gutless catenulid flatworms.\n\"Paracatenula\" is found worldwide in warm temperate to tropical subtidal sediments. They are part of the interstitial meiofauna of sandy sediments. Adult \"Paracatenula\" lack a mouth and a gut and are associated with intracellular symbiotic alphaproteobacteria of the genus \"Candidatus\". Riegeria.\nThe symbionts are housed in bacteriocytes in a specialized organ, the trophosome (Greek \u2018food\u2019). \"Ca.\" Riegeria can make up half of the worms' biomass. The beneficial symbiosis with the carbon dioxide fixing and sulfur-oxidizing endosymbionts allows the marine flatworm to live in nutrient poor environments. The symbionts \"not only\" provide the nutrition but also maintain the primary energy reserves in the symbiosis.\nDiversity.\nFive species of \"Paracatenula\" have been described - \"P. erato\", \"P. kalliope\", \"P. polyhymnia\", \"P. urania\" and \"P. galateia\", named after muses and nymphs of the Greek mythology. Several more species have been morphologically and molecularly identified, but are not formally described. The best studied species are \"P. galateia\" from the Belize barrier reef and a yet undescribed species \"P.\" sp. santandrea from the Italian Island of Elba.\nDistribution.\n\"Paracatenula\" are globally distributed in warm temperate to tropical regions and have been collected from Belize (Caribbean Sea), Egypt (Red Sea), Australia (Pacific Ocean) and Italy (Mediterranean Sea). They occur in the oxic-anoxic interface of subtidal sands and have been found in water depths up to 40 m.\nAnatomy.\n\"Paracatenula\" can reach a length of up to 15\u00a0mm and a width of 0.4\u00a0mm. Several larger species of \"Paracatenula\", such as \"P. galateia\" are flattened like a leaf, while all smaller species are round. All \"Paracatenula\" species examined so far were found to harbor bacterial symbionts in specialized symbiont-housing cells that form the nutritive organ - the trophosome. The frontal part of the worms - the rostrum - is transparent and bacteria-free, and houses the brain, while the trophosome region appears white due to light refracting inclusions in the bacterial symbionts. Some species of \"Paracatenula\" such as \"P. galateia\" possess a statocyst with a single statolith.\nLife cycle and reproduction.\nAlthough \"Paracatenula\" produce sperm and eggs that can be very informative to differentiate between species, sexual reproduction has not been observed. Instead, the worms reproduce by asexual fission or fragmentation, a process called paratomy. \"Paracatenula\" worms have high regenerative capabilities and can regenerate a lost head including the brain within 10\u201314 days The bacteriocytes of dividing worms are split during the fission process and the population of symbiotic bacteria is distributed to the two daughter individuals.\nHost-symbiont relationship.\n\"Paracatenula\" host their symbionts within bacteriocytes in the trophosome. These bacteria, named \"Ca.\" Riegeria, belong to the lineage alphaproteobacteria forming a monophyletic group within the order \"Rhodospirillales\" and the family \"[Rhodospirillaceae]\". The co-speciation between host and bacteria suggests a strict vertical transmission of the bacteria in which the endosymbionts are directly transferred from parents to their offspring. The symbiosis is shown to be beneficial for both partners. The lack of both a gut lumen and a mouth indicate that the host derives most of its nutrition from its symbionts, which have the potential for carbon dioxide fixation and sulfur oxidation. In return, the host provides its symbionts with a stable supply of electron donors such as sulfide and oxygen in a dynamic and heterogeneous environment. Furthermore, symbionts living intracellularly in the worms are protected from predation as well as competition for nutrients by other bacteria.\nSymbiont physiology.\nDespite having a reduced genome with roughly 1400 genes, \"Ca\". Riegeria symbionts have maintained a broad physiological repertoire, which stands in contrast to all other reduced symbionts vertically transmitted for hundreds of millions of years. \"Ca\". R. santandreae symbionts fix carbon dioxide, store carbon in multiple storage compounds and produce all necessary building blocks for cellular life, including sugars, nucleotides, amino acids, vitamins and co-factors.\nHost provisioning.\n\"Paracatenula\" lack mouth and gut, and are nutritionally dependent on their symbionts. In all other chemosynthetic symbioses the host acquires their nutrition by digestion of symbionts. In contrast to this, in \"Paracatenula\", the symbionts cater their host by secreting outer-membrane vesicles (OMVs) and symbiont digestion is rare. With their massive storage capabilities and the elegant way of providing the nutrition via OMVs, the symbionts have been suggested to form a \u2018bacterial liver\u2019 and peculiar \u2018battery\u2019 in the integrated \"Paracatenula\" symbiosis "}
{"title": "Cenometra_bella", "label": "Animal", "text": "Cenometra bella is a species of crinoids belonging to the genus \"Cenometra\". They can have up to 30 arms and can be of variable colours but are often characterised by a marked contrast between the extending free-arms and the feathery pinnules (for example, dark brown and white). This species clings to its support and moves around by its feet-like cirri.\nMorphology.\nLike many other Crinoids, C. \"bella\" is visually comparable to both a flowering plant and a sea star. This criter\u2019s evolutionary morphology has remained fairly constant with minimal changes in their appearance.\nThese small featherstars are predominantly dark brown on their underside. The underside reveals its finger-like brachials and cirri they use to walk and anchor themselves to objects. The centrodorsal plate is the round \u2018body\u2019 that holds its brachials and arms together, and averages at\u00a04.181mm in diameter. The mouth is located at the center of this plate. C. \"bella\" typically has five short, stiff and stout bifurcating arm bases that radiate from the centrodorsal plate of the comatulid ray, but this number can vary per individual.\u00a0 These arm bases branch out into two ossicles, giving them a total of ten or more free-arms. The longer non-branching portion of the arms makes up the majority of the arm length, much like many other members of the comatulida order. On average these non-branching feathery arms are 8.5\u00a0cm long for an adult C. \"bella\". Each arm has a long white central ridge with dark brown spotted pinnules that project outwards, and slightly taper inwards at the distal end, much like that of a fern plant. Not all, of their arms are regenerating, but every crinoid will have at least a few that are capable of regeneration.\nSkeletally, the brachitaxes are composed of two ossicles, with ambulacral appendices. The second pinnule is massive, hard and curved. The basal segment of the proximal pinnules is curved or rounded.\nReproduction &amp; Development.\nThere are male and female sexes of C. \"bella\". These gonochoric crinoids shed their ova or sperm from ruptured pinnules into the water. After fertilisation, their embryos grow into larvae that later sink to a substrate surface, like gorgonian coral. The growing larvae, once attached to a surface undergoes metamorphosis into a small crinoid and remains mostly sessile during growth.\nFeeding.\nThe beautiful crinoid\u00a0is a suspension feeder. They filter feed on marine microorganisms like algae, diatoms, and larvae. They also consume marine snow (detritus). This filtration occurs on their cirri, which is linked to the gut near the mouth and anus on the centrodorsal plate.\nBehaviour.\nThese featherstars are mostly sessile, anchoring themselves to hard substrate surfaces or the sea floor using their cirri \u2018legs\u2019. However, they are also free-moving creatures capable of travelling short distances to escape their predators or other threats. As nocturnal critters, they partially hide, sessile, within rocks and corals during the day with their mouths oriented upwards. Though their centrodorsal plate remains sheltered during the day as they wait till night to come out and feed, their free-arms can remain fully exposed in a circular fan-like arrangement outside of their habitat, throughout the day.\nDistribution &amp; Habitat.\nC. \"bella\" typically occupies shallow tropical waters, living in open-surfaces below depths of 5 meters. They are more commonly located around large coral species in coral reefs, and sometimes found in the intertidal zone. However, in rare cases, they have been found to establish habitat in the deeper ocean (up to 55m). These featherstars are often exposed on top of a gorgonian coral, under a reef flat, or clinging to sea whips.\nThis shallow water species is present in the Indo-West Pacific Ocean, thriving around South and South East Asia: India, the Philippines, China, South Japan, the Maldives, South Pacific Islands. C. \"bella\" has also been found in the Great Barrier reef.\nThreat &amp; Survival Adaptations.\nBeing mainly sessile creatures, the C. \"bella\" is highly susceptible to predators like large fish and other marine organisms. They may also lose limbs due to abiotic stressors like great salinity and temperature fluctuations. On average, the feather-star is reported to lose an arm every 8 to12 days.\u00a0As a survival mechanism, this crinoid has evolved to be able to lose and regenerate lost limbs, much like a sea-star. Their pinules are also spiked to protect them from predators.In addition, C. \"bella\" are able to produce aversive tasting and toxic chemicals to deter predators from consuming their arms that remain exposed out of their habitat throughout the day. The deterrent taste not only provides immediate protection from their predators but also forms long-term negative conditioning to prevent large fish from attacking again.\u00a0 These antifeedant chemicals also provide the beautiful crinoid\u2019s colour."}
{"title": "Eodiscina", "label": "Animal", "text": "Eodiscina is trilobite suborder. The Eodiscina first developed near the end of the Lower Cambrian period (late Atdabanian) and became extinct at the end of the Middle Cambrian. Species are tiny to small, and have a thorax of two or three segments. Eodiscina includes six families classified under one superfamily, Eodiscoidea.\nTaxonomy.\nThe Eodiscina are mostly considered the more primitive suborder of the Agnostida, and the Agnostina the more advanced. Some scholars do not consider the Agnostina true trilobites, and consequently rejected the idea that they were related to the Eodiscina. Consequently, these scientists have proposed to elevate the group to ordinal level, which would thus be called Eodiscida Kobayashi, 1939.\nOrigin.\nThe oldest known eodiscoid is \"Tsunyidiscus\". The glabella of \"Tsunyidiscus\" is extremely similar to that of \"Dipharus clarki\", and distinct from all other eodiscoids. \"D. clarki\" is thought to represent an immature stage of the redlichioid \"Bulaiaspis\" rather than an eodiscoid. This is because of the dominant palpebroocular ridges, extremely long librigenae, and free pleural tips on the pygidium of variable numbers of segments. In short: \"Tsunyidiscus\" has probably developed through paedomorphosis from \"Bulaiaspis\". Alternatively \"Sinodiscus changyangensis\" has been considered the most primitive of the Eodiscina.\nMany characters that are divergent from other trilobites may be explained by paedomorphosis, such as the small number of thorax segments and proparian facial sutures, that occur in all trilobites during larval development, while the Eodiscoid abatochroal eye is not unlike early development stages of the holochroal eye, where lenses are also separated.\nRelations within the Agnostida.\nThree lineages are thought to have evolved from the monotypical family Tsunyidiscidae. First the Calodiscidae. Second the Yukoniidae, who sprouted the Eodiscidae. And finally the Hebediscidae, that themselves gave rise to the Weymouthiidae, which contain \"Tannudiscus\", the probable ancestor of the peronopsid genus Archaeagnostus, the earliest of the Agnostina.\nDifferences with some other simplified trilobites.\nAgnostina and a few other trilobites also have very few thorax segments. All Agnostina lack eyes and only have two thorax segments, characters they share with some of the later Eodiscina. Eodiscina however always have an articulating half-ring. This seals the opening in the axis between cephalon and the anterior thorax segment that is created when the animal was enrolled. Agnostida do not have an articulating half-ring, resulting in an opening between the thorax and the cephalon when enrolled, called cephalothoracic aperture. \"Thoracocare\" (Corynexochida) has only two thoracic segments at maturity, but has a very wide subquadrate glabella that touches the frontal border along its entire width and lacks a pygidial border. \"Taklamakania\", \"Pseudampyxina\" and \"Nanshanaspis\" (Raphiophoridae) have 3 thorax segments, but with subtriangular cephalon and pygidium, genal spines, and \"Taklamakania\" with a frontal glabellar spine.\nDescription.\n Like all Agnostida, members of the Eodiscina are relatively small and isopygous with the cephalon and pygidium of approximately similar size and outline. Thorax consisting of two or three fulcrate secments. Cephalon strongly parabolic in outline with maximum width (tr.) usually anterior to genal angle and either occulate or lacking eyes. The border is convex. Hypostome is natant. Rostral plate is lacking or uncalcified. Facial sutures are present in early Eodiscina, but are lost in some later representatives. When present, the facial sutures are proparian. Outline of the pygidium closely matches that of the cephalon, is usually segmented, with axis almost extending to the border, and in some species the pleural region is segmented. Examples of the protaspid growth stage are known in a few species.\nEye.\nIf present, the eyes of Eodiscina are unique among trilobites. They have up to 70 small lenses per eye, not touching but separated from each other by the so-called interlensar sclera. Each lens has an individual cornea, that is limited to the lens surface. The interlensar sclera is not deeper than the lenses. This type of eye is called abathochroal. A second type of eye, called schizochroal, is unique to the Phacopina suborder, and has up to several hundreds of relatively large lenses (0.05-0.5\u00a0mm), that do not touch either, but the corneal membrane extends into the sclera outside the lens, and the sclera is deeper than the lens. The most usual type of trilobite eye, called holochroal, has usually thousands of small hexagonal lenses without an interlensar sclera, and a common cornea. Many later Eodiscina however, lost their visual organs altogether, and this may have resulted from living in an environment with very low visibility."}
{"title": "Scutellonema_bradys", "label": "Animal", "text": "Scutellonema bradys, also known as yam nematode, is a migratory endoparasitic nematode causing major damage to yam (\"Dioscorea\" spp.) crop in many African tropical regions, as well in parts of South and Central America and Asia. They can cause reduction of 20-30% in tuber weight at harvest.\nThis nematode is able to multiply in dry conditions causing complete rotting tubers, called dry rot, which decreases the commercial value of the tubers. Dry rot of yam occurs in the outer 1\u20132\u00a0cm of tubers. Symptoms of dry rot of yam include necrotic lesions beneath the skin, followed by yellow lesions below the outer skin of the tuber. External cracks appear in the skin of the tuber. The infections created by the nematode can serve as external opening facilitating fungi and bacteria colonization, causing wet rot. \"S. bradys\" feeds and reproduce in yams stored after harvest. Infested yam tubers are greatly damaged as a result of the continued reproduction of nematode.\nMorphological description.\n\"S. bradys\" belongs to the family Hoplolaimidae and is described as vermiform nematode when mature, measuring about 1\u00a0mm in length with a well-developed stylet. The body of the female has a length of 987.1 \u00b1 16.2\u00a0\u00b5m. The stylet is rounded basal knobs with the anterior portion of the spear tapering towards the end of the front half of the spear length. The esophageal glands elongate and overlap the intestine dorsal-laterally. The males have body shape similar to female with 983 \u00b1 14.3\u00a0\u00b5m. The testes are outstretched, with a visible large bursa enclosing the tail.\nReproduction and life cycle.\nEggs are laid in soil or plant tissue where they hatch and the juveniles develop into adults by moulting. Typically, it infects the young tubers through the tissues of the tuber growing point, alongside emerging roots and shoots, through roots and also through cracks or damaged areas in the tuber skin. The nematode feed intracellularly in the tuber tissue, causing rupture of cell wall, loss of cell contents and the formation of cavities. The cycle lasts 21 days and under favorable conditions can greatly increase its population. The \"S. bradys\" populations are affected by storage conditions and increase at twice the rate in tubers stored at 22\u201332\u00a0\u00b0C and relative humidity 40\u201385 %, when compared to tubers stored at 16\u201318\u00a0\u00b0C. The principal mean of dissemination of \"S. bradys\" is through yams that are propagated from whole tubers.\nHost range.\nAlthough yam is considered to be the main host to \"S. bradys\", cowpea (\"Vigna unguiculata\"), sesame (\"Sesamum indicum\"), tomato (\"Solanum lycopersicum\") and potato (\"Solanum tuberosum\") have been reported to allow the nematode reproduction. Siam weed (\"Chromolaena odorata\"), roselle (\"Hibiscus sabdariffa\"), yam bean (\"Sphenostylis stenocarpa\"), and pigeon pea (\"Cajanus cajan\") are also considered moderate hosts.\nManagement.\nThere are basically three methods that can be applied for management of \"S. bradys\": \nCultural practices.\nUsing non- or poor crop host in rotation, intercropping or as cover crop with yam will help reduce the nematode population in the soil. In a recent study, the use of porcupine jointvetch (\"Aeschynomene histrix\"), Mexican marigold (\"Tagetes erecta\"), stylo (\"Stylosanthes guianensis\"), velvet bean (\"Mucuna pruriens\") and kudzu (\"Pueraria phaseoloide\") intercropped with yam have shown to potential to reduce \"S. bradys\" population. Similarly, the exclusion of weed hosts such as \"Eupatorium\", \"Synedrella\" and \"Chromolaena\", will help to reduce nematode damage.\nThe use of nematode-free propagative material is the most appropriate method to prevent nematode damage. Seed tubers should be examined before planting and the ones showing symptoms of dry rot should not be used. It is important to note that in tubes not showing obvious external symptoms of damage, it is necessary to scrape away the surface layers to determine the presence of dry rot.\nHot water treatment.\nStudies have shown that treating tubers with hot water (50-55\u00a0\u00b0C) for up to 40 min gives the best control of \"S. bradys\", without damaging the tubers. However, this method it is not broadly used because of the cost, labor and difficulties of maintaining constant temperatures.\nResistance and tolerance.\nFull resistance to \"S. bradys\" has not been found in landraces or accessions examined in two of main species \"D. alata\" and \"D. rotundata\". \"D. dumetorum\" is generally considered to be less readily invaded than other species.\nChemical treatment.\nChemical control has shown some success in reducing \"S. bradys\" population. Four granular nematicides (aldicarb, oxamyl, carbofuran and miral) applied as post-plant sidedressing treatments effectively reduced the nematode population during the growing season and significantly increased yield without toxic accumulation in the harvested tubers."}
{"title": "Evasterias_troschelii", "label": "Animal", "text": "Evasterias troschelii is a species of starfish in the family Asteriidae. Its common names include the mottled star, false ochre sea star and Troschel's true star. It is found in Kamchatka and the north western coast of North America.\nTaxonomy.\nThe description of this species was first formally published in 1862 by William Stimpson under the name \"Asterias troschelii\" (Stimpson first presented the new species in a lecture at the Boston Society of Natural History in 1861). The holotype was collected in Puget sound, Washington. Only part of one arm still remains of this smallish specimen at the United States National Museum.\nIt was moved to the new genus \"Evasterias\" by Addison Emery Verrill in 1914, with as the type species. Verrill published five new varieties (\"alveolata\", \"densa\", \"parvispina\", \"rudis\" and \"subnodosa\") besides the nominate variety, and also published \"E. acanthostoma\" in 1914.\nAlexander Michailovitsch Djakonov synonymised all of Verrill's varieties, but retained \"alveolata\" as a \"forma\", and also made Verrill's \"E. acanthostoma\" a form of \"E. troschelii\", leaving the species with three forms including the nominate.\nDescription.\nThe mottled star is a large starfish with a radius of up to . It has a small disc and five long narrow arms often turned up at the tip. The widest point of the arms is a little distance away from the edge of the disc. The aboral (upper or dorsal) surface of the disc is covered with a network of calcareous plates with spines about long surrounded by smaller spines and crossed and straight pedicellariae, minute pincer-like structures with two jaws. There is an irregular line of white-tipped spines running down the centre of the arms and the whole upper surface is rough to the touch. On the oral (lower or ventral) surface a long ambulacral groove stretches from the central mouth to the tip of each arm with four rows of tube feet and clumps of pedicellariae and spines on either side. The colour is very variable and includes plain or mottled shades of orange, brown, greenish-grey, bluish-grey and pale purple. The outer edges of the arms often have a contrasting coloured rim and the underside is pale brown.\nDistribution and habitat.\n\"Evasterias troschelii\" is found on the west coast of North America. Its range extends from Pribilof Islands, Alaska southwards to Monterey Bay, California but it is rarely seen south of Puget Sound. It also occurs in Kamchatka (Bechevinskaya Bay). It is usually found on rocks and pebbles and occasionally on sand, at depths down to about or . In bays and other sheltered locations it largely replaces the other common species of the area, the purple sea star (\"Pisaster ochraceus\").\nEcology.\nBreeding.\nIn the north of its range, breeding takes place from April to June. Large numbers of small eggs are produced and fertilisation is external. The bipinnaria larvae that develop from these form part of the zooplankton and disperse with the currents.\nPrey.\nThe mottled star is a predator and feeds largely on bivalve molluscs. With its tube feet it can exert a powerful traction on the two valves of a mollusc shell, pulling them sufficiently far apart to insert part of its stomach through the gap. It then uses digestive enzymes to break down the mollusc's tissues before sucking them out and removing its stomach from the shell. It also consumes barnacles, chitons, gastropod molluscs, tunicates and brachiopods. Some species of limpet exhibit behavioural responses to the presence of the mottled star and are able to evade it.\nPetroleum hydrocarbons, such as those released as a result of the Exxon Valdez spillage, have a greater effect on the feeding and growth of the mottled star than on one of its main prey species, the mussel \"Mytilus edulis\". Researchers surmised that pollution of the marine environment with oil might result in the domination of the mussel in the low intertidal zone of the region.\nOther species interactions.\nThe scale worm \"Arctonoe fragilis\" is often found living on the surface or in an ambulacral groove of the mottled star as a commensal. The parasitic ciliate \"Orchitophrya stellarum\" has several hosts, one of which is the mottled star. It lives among the spines on the body and arms until the starfish is ready to breed when it moves inside its host, probably entering through a gonopore. It makes its way to the gonads of the male starfish and feeds on the sperm, effectively castrating its host.\nJuvenile Alaskan king crabs \"(Paralithodes camtschaticus)\" have been observed living as commensals on the surface of the mottled star, sheltering between its arms. Adult king crabs have been reported as attacking and eating the starfish. It is also preyed on by gulls in the intertidal zone and by the morning sunstar (\"Solaster dawsoni\") and the sunflower seastar (\"Pycnopodia helianthoides\")."}
{"title": "Stichaster_australis", "label": "Animal", "text": "Stichaster australis, the reef starfish, is a species of starfish found in the shallow waters of the rocky intertidal of New Zealand. Typically, the animal is endemic to the west coast shores of the North and South Islands, where wave action is increased. They do not usually inhabit ecosystems that have reduced wave action and calm conditions as they prefer a higher-energy environment. These marine invertebrates range in color from pink to purple, but can also be orange. They typically have eleven arms, but sometimes they may have either ten or twelve. As full-grown adults, they are 8 to 10\u00a0cm in diameter.\nReproduction.\nThe starfish engages in external fertilization in which the female releases the eggs and the male releases the sperm. Fertilization occurs in the water column. Its breeding season is the summer. During this time, male and female starfish can be found extremely close or even on top of one another. Consequently, spawning occurring several times from October through January.\nLife cycle.\n\"Stichaster australis\", like the majority of other starfish, exhibits two life stages, planktonic and benthic. Once the eggs of the invertebrate are fertilized, bilaterally symmetrical planktonic larvae are formed. At this stage, these larvae are known as bipinnaria. The planktotrophic larval stage for \"S. australis\" will last about 6 months, with larvae typically settling any time from May through July. It is during this time that the larvae, now brachiolaria, enters the benthic phase of life. The brachiolaria will settle exclusively on the red algae \"Mesophyllum insigne\", their only source of food until they mature. \"M. insigne\" can be found growing on both boulders and reefs located in the lower intertidal zone and subtidal zone. Both \"M. insigne\" and the juvenile starfish are limited to the lower levels of the ecosystems as they have low tolerances for desiccation.\nGrowth and maturation.\nThe starfish can begin the metamorphosis into an adult once its characteristic radial symmetry is developed. Right after metamorphosis, the critter has a diameter of about 0.85\u00a0mm. Initial growth of the starfish is slow until the addition of the 6th arm, but once that happens, the addition of new arms occurs more rapidly. Arm 7 will grow in between arms 6 and 1, arm 8 will grow in between arms 7 and 1, and arm 9 will grow in between arms 8 and 1, and so on. The growth of arms occurs in a clockwise pattern when viewing the animal aborally, the side containing the buttocks of the organism. The sea star will become sexually mature upon reaching size of about 5 to 8\u00a0cm in diameter.\nDiet.\nJuveniles, until reaching about 0.8\u00a0cm in diameter, when they are about 7 to 8 months old, feed purely on M. insigne. The starfish will remain at the M. insigne nursery for about a year. This coralline alga is rich in calcium which is beneficial for the young starfish and its skeletal growth. After this stage, the diet of \"S. australis\" shifts to include, but is not limited to, \"P. canaliculus\". The starfish, as it increases in size to about 2 to 2.5\u00a0cm in diameter and begins to mature, will then solely feed on the mussels. The diet of this starfish during the adult stage consists mainly of \"Perna canaliculus\", the New Zealand green mussel. This carnivorous shift in diet is consistent with a relocation from the nursery algal spaces to close reefs containing dense populations of \"P. canaliculus\". The mussel beds ultimately become the permanent home for this invertebrate. In order to feed on the mussel, \"Stichaster australis\" utilizes its tubular feet to tug on the sides of the mussel\u2019s shell. Once the shell is broken, the starfish inserts its stomach to digest the innards of the prey. Once the sea star is finished digesting its prey, it will swallow its own stomach back into its own body. After feeding, the starfish will leave white marks on the mussel, a remnant of the predatory relationship.\nResearch.\nThis predatory relationship between starfish and mussels in this intertidal zone was studied by Robert T. Paine in a paper published in 1971. The scientist removed \"S. australis\" from the ecosystem for 9 months. In this time, \"P. canaliculus\", with the removal of its primary predator, was able to proliferate and increase its presence and hold in the ecosystem. When expanding their area within the intertidal, the mussels overgrew and outcompeted the other species, decreasing the species richness in the area from 20 species to 14 species. The mussels expanded its vertical distribution and 40% of the available space in the ecosystem was inhabited by these organisms. Paine proposed that \"S. australis\" is a keystone species of the rocky intertidal of New Zealand since it is responsible for maintaining not only the intertidal zonation, but the diversity of species within this ecosystem."}

It is the type species of the genus \"Serpula\" and was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1767 12th edition of \"Systema Naturae\". It lives in a tube into which it can retract.\nDescription.\n\"Serpula vermicularis\" lives in a calcareous tube which is attached to a rock, boulder or other hard surface. The tube is often curved, but is not tightly coiled as in some other related species. It can grow to a length of , but is usually shorter than this. The anterior part of the worm protrudes from the tube and has a plume of about 40 feather-like radioles projecting from the second segment, or peristomium, which also houses the two eyes and the mouth. The radioles are bipinnate and covered with fine cilia. They are commonly red, orange or pink and are usually banded with white. A funnel-shaped lid or operculum covers the entrance to the tube when the animal retracts inside. This lid has up to 160 fine creases around its edge and is symmetrical and usually red. It is sometimes divided into two. The yellow-coloured body has seven thoracic segments and up to 190 abdominal segments which are protected by the tube. At least four segments with setae (bristles) are found in the thoracic region.\nDistribution.\n\"Serpula vermicularis\" is cosmopolitan in distribution. It is found in the Pacific and Indian Oceans and the European seaboard of the Atlantic Ocean, but not on the North American coast. It occurs in the intertidal zone and at depths down to . Also along Southern African coast from Olifant's River to Maputo.\nHabitat.\n\"Serpula vermicularis\" grows on hard substrates. It favours shells of bivalves, boulders and man-made structures. Around the United Kingdom, juveniles were found to be plentiful growing on the bryozoan, \"Flustra foliacea\". Large colonies sometimes form, but these are seldom on rocks. Larvae may settle on the tubes of other worms and their subsequent development can form reefs. These reefs are very fragile and often break up. This is sometimes due to the activity of certain boring sponges, such as \"Cliona celata\" (red boring sponge).\nBiology.\nThe tube of \"S. vermicularis\" is made from calcite and aragonite. Calcium for its manufacture is stored in two white sacs on the ventral side of the peristomium. The tube is fabricated by the glandular ventral shields on the other thoracic segments, where calcium is mixed with an organic secretion to make a paste. This is formed into shape by a collar found just behind the first segment, the prostomium.\n\"Serpula vermicularis\" is a filter feeder and extends its radioles to catch phytoplankton and detritus. The radioles also act as gills. Blood is pumped in and out of these with the flow direction alternating in a single set of vessels. The blood is then pumped through a ventral blood vessel to the tip of the abdomen before returning through a sinus adjoining the gut.\nThe blood of \"S. vermicularis\" contains the oxygen-binding pigment chlorocruorin. As well as transporting oxygen to the tissues, this binds carbon monoxide much more efficiently than does human haemoglobin. This may be the reason why the worm may settle and grow on brown seaweeds such as \"Fucus\", but avoids giant kelp, \"Nereocystis\". The latter uses carbon monoxide to inflate its pneumocysts, and this would be toxic to the worm.\nLife cycle.\nIn the United Kingdom, spawning takes place between June and September. The larvae form part of the plankton for up to two months before settling on the seabed. Growth is fairly rapid with tubes extending by in a month. The worms mature in about 10 months and may live for several years.\nEcology.\nColdwater reefs built up by \"S. vermicularis\" take many years to develop and provide a hard substrate which other organisms use. The reefs around the United Kingdom support a diverse community of sessile invertebrates, including sponges, hydroids, ascidians, bryozoans, the worm \"Pomatoceros triqueter\", the sea anemone \"Metridium senile\" and bivalves such as \"Chlamys\" spp., \"Modiolus modiolus\" and queen scallop, \"Aequipecten opercularis\". Macrofauna include crabs such as \"Cancer pagurus\", the sea urchins \"Echinus esculentus\" and \"Psammechinus miliaris\", the brittle star \"Ophiothrix fragilis\", the starfish \"Asterias rubens\" and the whelk \"Buccinum undatum\". Red algae grow on the reef in shallow water. The tunicate \"Pyura microcosmus\" occurs on these reefs, but is seldom seen in other habitats. A large number of cryptic species of microfauna shelter among the tubes.\nPredators of the worm include sea urchins, starfish, and the wrasses \"Crenilabrus melops\" and \"Ctenolabrus rupestris\"."}
{"title": "Megalodiscus_temperatus", "label": "Animal", "text": "Megalodiscus temperatus is a Digenean in the phylum Platyhelminthes. This parasite belongs to the Diplodiscidae family and is a common parasite located in the urinary bladder and rectum of frogs. The primary host is frogs and the intermediate hosts of \"Megalodiscus temeperatus\" are freshwater snails in the genus \"Helisoma\".\nMorphology.\n\"Megalodiscus temperatus\" are flukes that contain a pair of posterior fluid filled pouch located in the oral sucker with a posterior sucker that is equal to the largest width of the body. The tegumental surface of this parasite contains various rows of indentations. The patterns of the indentation merge into several areas into folds with ridges that represent the posterior and genital pores.\nReproduction.\nThe reproduction of \"Megalodiscus temperatus\" are displayed in the stomach and rectum of frogs and tadpoles. The snails that are diffused with miracidia releases cercariae into the water to penetrate the skin of frogs. The frogs regularly cast off the outer layers of the skin which results in their exposure to metaceriae. The metaceriae remains in the rectum of the frog and matures in the time span of four months. Tadpoles are less commonly infected, but when infected they are infected by the ingestion of cercaria. Through the process of metaphorphosis, \"Megalodiscus temperatus\" travels primarily from the anterior to the posterior of the rectum.\nGeographical range.\n\"Megalodiscus temperatus\" are commonly prevalent in the high altitude regions of the United States.\nTransmission.\n\"M. temperatus\" preferentially infects snails-its first intermediate host, tadpoles, and frogs-its definitive host. Thus, environments harboring \"M. temperatus\" include streams, ponds, and bodies of water. Snails, commonly \"Helisoma trivolvis\", \"H. antosum\" and \"H. campanulata\", acquire infection by way of miracidia penetration. Upon embryonated egg deposition into aqueous environments from feces of adult flukes in the large intestine of tadpoles and rectum of frogs, miracidia penetrate snails and undergo three generations of rediae in the liver-the third producing and releasing an immature cercariae into the tissues of the snail host. Daily shedding of mature cercariae opportunistically encyst on the skin of tadpoles and adult frogs, particularly the dark spots of the fore and hindlegs. Tadpoles then become infected by ingestion of such encysted metacercariae or inhalation of free cercariae and attach onto the large intestine and become gravid. During the process of metamorphosis, the process at which tadpoles structurally mature into adult frogs, flukes migrate superiorly into the small intestine, as far as possible as to elude being dispensed. As the intestine shortens after metamorphosis and adolescent frogs begin development of a protein diet, the remaining flukes return to the rectum. Infection in adult frogs may also occur by ingestion of metacercariae.\nDiagnosis.\nInfection by \"M. temperatus\" may be identified by examining miracidia on snails, dead cercarae or formed metacercariae on tadpoles, and/or rectal flukes in adult frogs via dissection.\nTreatment.\nBased on the similar tegument integrity of \"M. temperatus\", in comparison with other anthelmintics, Praziquantel (PZQ) may be used as treatment to combat infection.\nDisease control.\nVulnerable populations in North America susceptible to \"M. temperatus\" infection include snails-first definitive hosts, tadpoles, and frogs-definitive hosts to the parasite. Localized in the hepatopancreas of snails, large intestine of tadpoles, and rectum of adult frogs, means of disease control include: random and periodic testing of vulnerable species populations for infection, controlling both snail and frog populations, and/or controlling saturated ecosystems infected with \"M. temperatus\" via pesticides, introduction of new species to combat transmission and minimize both transmission prevalence and incidence of infection.\nReferences.\nBurton, Bogitsh.

{"title": "Anguina_agrostis", "label": "Animal", "text": "Anguina agrostis (Bentgrass nematode, seed-gall nematode) is a plant pathogenic nematode.\nHistory and significance.\n\"Anguina agrostis\" was one of the first plant parasitic nematodes to be taxonomically described by J.G. Steinbuch in 1799. While on a \u201cbotanical walk\u201d, Steinbuch collected samples from a grass that resembled \"Agrostis silvatica\". He examined the samples and discovered that the grass was not \"A. silvatica\" but was rather a degenerate form of \"Agrostis capillaris\"; he further discovered that \"A. silvatica\" is not a true species (or variety) but that the misclassification of the grass was due to the formation of galls by \"A. agrostis\" parasitism. Galls caused by \"A. agrostis\" have glumes that are 4-5 times longer than normal and can cause yield losses of up to 40-70%. In addition to crop loss, \"A. agrostis\" associates with pathogenic bacteria \"Rathayibacter rathayi\" (formerly \"Corynebacterium rathayi\") to cause annual ryegrass toxicity in Australia.\nHosts and distribution.\n\"A. agrostis\" infects bentgrasses within the genus \"Agrostis\" as well as annual and perennial ryegrasses (\"Lolium\" spp.). The nematode can also infect 14 other genera of grasses. \"A. agrostis\" has been found in Australia, New Zealand, Western Europe, former USSR, Canada, and the United States.\nMorphology.\nThe lip region is slightly offset (3-4\u00a0\u00b5m high) and the nematode has a very short stylet (10\u00a0\u00b5m). \"A. agrostis\" has a three-part esophagus. The procorpus is cylindrical with a swelling near its midsection. The metacorpus is ovoid in shape and the isthmus is long and narrow. The postcorpus has three glands and is highly developed, but does not overlap the intestine. On average, infective juveniles (J2) measure 530\u00a0\u00b5m and dauer juveniles measure 760\u00a0\u00b5m; the increase in size is due to feeding and the formation of lipid droplets or storage bodies. Females range from 1.5 to 2.7\u00a0mm in length, are curved ventrally, and are swollen. The vulva is located near the posterior end and one ovary is present. Males are smaller (1.1-1.7\u00a0mm in length), are not as swollen, and have a small bursae that extends subterminally. One testis is present.\nLife cycle and reproduction.\nInfective second stage juveniles (J2) find a young host, migrate to areas of new growth and are carried up with the growing point of the plant. They may feed ectoparasitically until formation of the inflorescence, at which time the J2 invades the ovule, becomes sedentary, and a gall begins to form. Within the gall, nematodes progress through three molts to reach adulthood (J3, J4, male and female adults). Reproduction is amphimictic and females can lay up to 1000 eggs. The first molt occurs in the egg and the nematode hatches as a J2. These juveniles undergo anhydrobiosis and become the dormant dauer larvae to withstand the hot summer heat of Australia. Autumn rains rehydrate the dauer juveniles which become active to begin the life cycle over again. Only one generation is produced per year.\nHost-parasite relationship.\nInfective second stage juveniles colonize plants during the vegetative growth stage and may feed ectoparasitically during this time. When the inflorescence begins to form, the J2s invade the flower ovule and begin to feed endoparasitically. Nematode feeding on floret primordia induces rapid cell division, cell enlargement, and subsequent cell degeneration and collapse. The continuation of this process results in the formation of a large central cavity (in which the now-sedentary nematodes reside) enveloped by a gall wall. Gall size increases rapidly as nematodes grow and reproduce. The gall wall is several cell layers thick. Inner cells of the gall wall (near the cavity) have dense cytoplasm with several mitochondria, indicating high levels of metabolic activity. These cells most likely provide nutrients to the nematodes. The outer layers of the gall wall are unmodified, thereby forming and maintaining the gall structure. As the plant senesces, the galls desiccate and the nematodes undergo anhydrobiosis.\nManagement.\nTo mitigate the effects of annual ryegrass toxicity, farmers can move their livestock another, uninfected pasture at first sign of toxicity. Hot water treatments or chemical seed treatments have been used to produce clean seed. Infected pastures can be managed by mowing, herbicide treatments, or burning. These techniques eliminate the development of inflorescences and halt the life cycle of the nematode since they only mature to adulthood within the seed gall. \"A. agrostis\" cannot survive in the soil for more than one year and thus practices such as crop rotation or fallow have proven to be effective in managing the nematode."}
{"title": "Unix", "label": "Software", "text": "Unix (; trademarked as UNIX) is a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems that derive from the original AT&amp;T Unix, whose development started in 1969 at the Bell Labs research center by Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, and others.\nInitially intended for use inside the Bell System, AT&amp;T licensed Unix to outside parties in the late 1970s, leading to a variety of both academic and commercial Unix variants from vendors including University of California, Berkeley (BSD), Microsoft (Xenix), Sun Microsystems (SunOS/Solaris), HP/HPE (HP-UX), and IBM (AIX). In the early 1990s, AT&amp;T sold its rights in Unix to Novell, which then sold its Unix business to the Santa Cruz Operation (SCO) in 1995. The UNIX trademark passed to The Open Group, an industry consortium founded in 1996, which allows the use of the mark for certified operating systems that comply with the Single UNIX Specification (SUS). However, Novell continues to own the Unix copyrights, which the SCO Group, Inc. v. Novell, Inc. court case (2010) confirmed.\nUnix systems are characterized by a modular design that is sometimes called the \"Unix philosophy\". According to this philosophy, the operating system should provide a set of simple tools, each of which performs a limited, well-defined function. A unified and inode-based filesystem (the Unix filesystem) and an inter-process communication mechanism known as \"pipes\" serve as the main means of communication, and a shell scripting and command language (the Unix shell) is used to combine the tools to perform complex workflows.\nUnix distinguishes itself from its predecessors as the first portable operating system: almost the entire operating system is written in the C programming language, which allows Unix to operate on numerous platforms.\nOverview.\nUnix was originally meant to be a convenient platform for programmers developing software to be run on it and on other systems, rather than for non-programmers. The system grew larger as the operating system started spreading in academic circles, and as users added their own tools to the system and shared them with colleagues.\nAt first, Unix was not designed to be portable or for multi-tasking. Later, Unix gradually gained portability, multi-tasking and multi-user capabilities in a time-sharing configuration. Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of plain text for storing data; a hierarchical file system; treating devices and certain types of inter-process communication (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of software tools, small programs that can be strung together through a command-line interpreter using pipes, as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality. These concepts are collectively known as the \"Unix philosophy\". Brian Kernighan and Rob Pike summarize this in \"The Unix Programming Environment\" as \"the idea that the power of a system comes more from the relationships among programs than from the programs themselves\".\nBy the early 1980s, users began seeing Unix as a potential universal operating system, suitable for computers of all sizes. The Unix environment and the client\u2013server program model were essential elements in the development of the Internet and the reshaping of computing as centered in networks rather than in individual computers.\nBoth Unix and the C programming language were developed by AT&amp;T and distributed to government and academic institutions, which led to both being ported to a wider variety of machine families than any other operating system.\nThe Unix operating system consists of many libraries and utilities along with the master control program, the kernel. The kernel provides services to start and stop programs, handles the file system and other common \"low-level\" tasks that most programs share, and schedules access to avoid conflicts when programs try to access the same resource or device simultaneously. To mediate such access, the kernel has special rights, reflected in the distinction of \"kernel space\" from user space, the latter being a priority realm where most application programs operate.\nHistory.\nThe origins of Unix date back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, and General Electric were developing Multics, a time-sharing operating system for the GE-645 mainframe computer.\nMultics featured several innovations, but also presented severe problems. Frustrated by the size and complexity of Multics, but not by its goals, individual researchers at Bell Labs started withdrawing from the project. The last to leave were Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna, who decided to reimplement their experiences in a new project of smaller scale. This new operating system was initially without organizational backing, and also without a name.\nThe new operating system was a single-tasking system. In 1970, the group coined the name \"Unics\" for \"Uniplexed Information and Computing Service\" as a pun on \"Multics\", which stood for \"Multiplexed Information and Computer Services\". Brian Kernighan takes credit for the idea, but adds that \"no one can remember\" the origin of the final spelling \"Unix\". Dennis Ritchie, Doug McIlroy, and Peter G. Neumann also credit Kernighan.\nThe operating system was originally written in assembly language, \nbut in 1973, Version 4 Unix was rewritten in C. Version 4 Unix, however, still had many PDP-11 dependent codes, and was not suitable for porting. The first port to another platform was made five years later (1978) for the Interdata 8/32.\nIn 1974, Ken Robinson of the Department of Computer Science at University of New South Wales (UNSW) in Australia requested a copy of Unix for their PDP-11/40 minicomputer from Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs. This 1975 installation made UNSW the first university outside the United States to run Unix.\nBell Labs produced several versions of Unix that are collectively referred to as \"Research Unix\". In 1975, the first source license for \"UNIX\" was sold to Donald B. Gillies at the University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign Department of Computer Science (UIUC). UIUC graduate student Greg Chesson, who had worked on the Unix kernel at Bell Labs, was instrumental in negotiating the terms of the license.\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (BSD and System\u00a0V) by commercial startups, which in turn led to Unix fragmenting into multiple, similar but often slightly mutually-incompatible systems including DYNIX, HP-UX, SunOS/Solaris, AIX, and Xenix. In the late 1980s, AT&amp;T Unix System Laboratories and Sun Microsystems developed System\u00a0V Release\u00a04 (SVR4), which was subsequently adopted by many commercial Unix vendors.\nIn the 1990s, Unix and Unix-like systems grew in popularity and became the operating system of choice for over 90% of the world's top 500 fastest supercomputers, as BSD and Linux distributions were developed through collaboration by a worldwide network of programmers. In 2000, Apple released Darwin, also a Unix system, which became the core of the Mac OS X operating system, later renamed macOS.\nUnix operating systems are widely used in modern servers, workstations, and mobile devices.\nStandards.\nIn the late 1980s, an open operating system standardization effort now known as POSIX provided a common baseline for all operating systems; IEEE based POSIX around the common structure of the major competing variants of the Unix system, publishing the first POSIX standard in 1988. In the early 1990s, a separate but very similar effort was started by an industry consortium, the Common Open Software Environment (COSE) initiative, which eventually became the Single UNIX Specification (SUS) administered by The Open Group. Starting in 1998, the Open Group and IEEE started the Austin Group, to provide a common definition of POSIX and the Single UNIX Specification, which, by 2008, had become the Open Group Base Specification.\nIn 1999, in an effort towards compatibility, several Unix system vendors agreed on SVR4's Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) as the standard for binary and object code files. The common format allows substantial binary compatibility among different Unix systems operating on the same CPU architecture.\nThe Filesystem Hierarchy Standard was created to provide a reference directory layout for Unix-like operating systems; it has mainly been used in Linux.\nComponents.\nThe Unix system is composed of several components that were originally packaged together. By including the development environment, libraries, documents and the portable, modifiable source code for all of these components, in addition to the kernel of an operating system, Unix was a self-contained software system. This was one of the key reasons it emerged as an important teaching and learning tool and has had such a broad influence.\nThe inclusion of these components did not make the system large the original V7 UNIX distribution, consisting of copies of all of the compiled binaries plus all of the source code and documentation occupied less than 10\u00a0MB and arrived on a single nine-track magnetic tape. The printed documentation, typeset from the online sources, was contained in two volumes.\nThe names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Nonetheless, the V7 implementation is considered by many to have the canonical early structure:\nImpact.\nThe Unix system had a significant impact on other operating systems. It achieved its reputation by its interactivity, by providing the software at a nominal fee for educational use, by running on inexpensive hardware, and by being easy to adapt and move to different machines. Unix was originally written in assembly language, but was soon rewritten in C, a high-level programming language. Although this followed the lead of Multics and Burroughs MCP, it was Unix that popularized the idea.\nUnix had a drastically simplified file model compared to many contemporary operating systems: treating all kinds of files as simple byte arrays. The file system hierarchy contained machine services and devices (such as printers, terminals, or disk drives), providing a uniform interface, but at the expense of occasionally requiring additional mechanisms such as ioctl and mode flags to access features of the hardware that did not fit the simple \"stream of bytes\" model. The Plan 9 operating system pushed this model even further and eliminated the need for additional mechanisms.\nUnix also popularized the hierarchical file system with arbitrarily nested subdirectories, originally introduced by Multics. Other common operating systems of the era had ways to divide a storage device into multiple directories or sections, but they had a fixed number of levels, often only one level. Several major proprietary operating systems eventually added recursive subdirectory capabilities also patterned after Multics. DEC's RSX-11M's \"group, user\" hierarchy evolved into OpenVMS directories, CP/M's volumes evolved into MS-DOS 2.0+ subdirectories, and HP's MPE group.account hierarchy and IBM's SSP and OS/400 library systems were folded into broader POSIX file systems.\nMaking the command interpreter an ordinary user-level program, with additional commands provided as separate programs, was another Multics innovation popularized by Unix. The Unix shell used the same language for interactive commands as for scripting (shell scripts\u00a0\u2013 there was no separate job control language like IBM's JCL). Since the shell and OS commands were \"just another program\", the user could choose (or even write) their own shell. New commands could be added without changing the shell itself. Unix's innovative command-line syntax for creating modular chains of producer-consumer processes (pipelines) made a powerful programming paradigm (coroutines) widely available. Many later command-line interpreters have been inspired by the Unix shell.\nA fundamental simplifying assumption of Unix was its focus on newline-delimited text for nearly all file formats. There were no \"binary\" editors in the original version of Unix\u00a0\u2013 the entire system was configured using textual shell command scripts. The common denominator in the I/O system was the byte\u00a0\u2013 unlike \"record-based\" file systems. The focus on text for representing nearly everything made Unix pipes especially useful and encouraged the development of simple, general tools that could be easily combined to perform more complicated \"ad hoc\" tasks. The focus on text and bytes made the system far more scalable and portable than other systems. Over time, text-based applications have also proven popular in application areas, such as printing languages (PostScript, ODF), and at the application layer of the Internet protocols, e.g., FTP, SMTP, HTTP, SOAP, and SIP.\nUnix popularized a syntax for regular expressions that found widespread use. The Unix programming interface became the basis for a widely implemented operating system interface standard (POSIX, see above). The C programming language soon spread beyond Unix, and is now ubiquitous in systems and applications programming.\nEarly Unix developers were important in bringing the concepts of modularity and reusability into software engineering practice, spawning a \"software tools\" movement. Over time, the leading developers of Unix (and programs that ran on it) established a set of cultural norms for developing software, norms which became as important and influential as the technology of Unix itself; this has been termed the Unix philosophy.\nThe TCP/IP networking protocols were quickly implemented on the Unix versions widely used on relatively inexpensive computers, which contributed to the Internet explosion of worldwide real-time connectivity, and which formed the basis for implementations on many other platforms.\nThe Unix policy of extensive on-line documentation and (for many years) ready access to all system source code raised programmer expectations, and contributed to the launch of the free software movement in 1983.\nFree Unix and Unix-like variants.\nIn 1983, Richard Stallman announced the GNU (short for \"GNU's Not Unix\") project, an ambitious effort to create a free software Unix-like system; \"free\" in the sense that everyone who received a copy would be free to use, study, modify, and redistribute it. The GNU project's own kernel development project, GNU Hurd, had not yet produced a working kernel, but in 1991 Linus Torvalds released the Linux kernel as free software under the GNU General Public License. In addition to their use in the GNU operating system, many GNU packages\u00a0\u2013 such as the GNU Compiler Collection (and the rest of the GNU toolchain), the GNU C library and the GNU core utilities\u00a0\u2013 have gone on to play central roles in other free Unix systems as well.\nLinux distributions, consisting of the Linux kernel and large collections of compatible software have become popular both with individual users and in business. Popular distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, SUSE Linux Enterprise, openSUSE, Debian, Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Mandriva Linux, Slackware Linux, Arch Linux and Gentoo.\nA free derivative of BSD Unix, 386BSD, was released in 1992 and led to the NetBSD and FreeBSD projects. With the 1994 settlement of a lawsuit brought against the University of California and Berkeley Software Design Inc. (\"USL v. BSDi\") by Unix System Laboratories, it was clarified that Berkeley had the right to distribute BSD Unix for free if it so desired. Since then, BSD Unix has been developed in several different product branches, including OpenBSD and DragonFly BSD.\nLinux and BSD are increasingly filling the market needs traditionally served by proprietary Unix operating systems, as well as expanding into new markets such as the consumer desktop and mobile and embedded devices. Because of the modular design of the Unix model, sharing components is relatively common; consequently, most or all Unix and Unix-like systems include at least some BSD code, and some systems also include GNU utilities in their distributions.\nIn a 1999 interview, Dennis Ritchie voiced his opinion that Linux and BSD operating systems are a continuation of the basis of the Unix design, and are derivatives of Unix:\nIn the same interview, he states that he views both Unix and Linux as \"the continuation of ideas that were started by Ken and me and many others, many years ago\".\nOpenSolaris was the free software counterpart to Solaris developed by Sun Microsystems, which included a CDDL-licensed kernel and a primarily GNU userland. However, Oracle discontinued the project upon their acquisition of Sun, which prompted a group of former Sun employees and members of the OpenSolaris community to fork OpenSolaris into the illumos kernel. As of 2014, illumos remains the only active open-source System V derivative.\nARPANET.\nIn May 1975, RFC 681 described the development of \"Network Unix\" by the Center for Advanced Computation at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. The Unix system was said to \"present several interesting capabilities as an ARPANET mini-host\". At the time, Unix required a license from Bell Telephone Laboratories that cost US$20,000 for non-university institutions, while universities could obtain a license for a nominal fee of $150. It was noted that Bell was \"open to suggestions\" for an ARPANET-wide license.\nThe RFC specifically mentions that Unix \"offers powerful local processing facilities in terms of user programs, several compilers, an editor based on QED, a versatile document preparation system, and an efficient file system featuring sophisticated access control, mountable and de-mountable volumes, and a unified treatment of peripherals as special files.\" The latter permitted the Network Control Program (NCP) to be integrated within the Unix file system, treating network connections as special files that could be accessed through standard Unix I/O calls, which included the added benefit of closing all connections on program exit, should the user neglect to do so. The modular design of Unix allowed them \"to minimize the amount of code added to the basic Unix kernel\", with much of the NCP code in a swappable user process, running only when needed.\nBranding.\nIn October 1993, Novell, the company that owned the rights to the Unix System V source at the time, transferred the trademarks of Unix to the X/Open Company (now The Open Group), and in 1995 sold the related business operations to Santa Cruz Operation (SCO). Whether Novell also sold the copyrights to the actual software was the subject of a federal lawsuit in 2006, \"SCO v. Novell\", which Novell won. The case was appealed, but on August 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the trial decisions, closing the case. Unix vendor SCO Group Inc. accused Novell of slander of title.\nThe present owner of the trademark \"UNIX\" is The Open Group, an industry standards consortium. Only systems fully compliant with and certified to the Single UNIX Specification qualify as \"UNIX\" (others are called \"Unix-like\").\nBy decree of The Open Group, the term \"UNIX\" refers more to a class of operating systems than to a specific implementation of an operating system; those operating systems which meet The Open Group's Single UNIX Specification should be able to bear the UNIX 98 or UNIX 03 trademarks today, after the operating system's vendor pays a substantial certification fee and annual trademark royalties to The Open Group. Systems that have been licensed to use the UNIX trademark include AIX, EulerOS, HP-UX, Inspur K-UX, IRIX, macOS, Solaris, Tru64 UNIX (formerly \"Digital UNIX\", or OSF/1), and z/OS. Notably, EulerOS and Inspur K-UX are Linux distributions certified as UNIX\u00a003 compliant.\nSometimes a representation like \"Un*x\", \"*NIX\", or \"*N?X\" is used to indicate all operating systems similar to Unix. This comes from the use of the asterisk (\"*\") and the question mark characters as wildcard indicators in many utilities. This notation is also used to describe other Unix-like systems that have not met the requirements for UNIX branding from the Open Group.\nThe Open Group requests that \"UNIX\" is always used as an adjective followed by a generic term such as \"system\" to help avoid the creation of a genericized trademark.\n\"Unix\" was the original formatting, but the usage of \"UNIX\" remains widespread because it was once typeset in small caps (\"Unix\"). According to Dennis Ritchie, when presenting the original Unix paper to the third Operating Systems Symposium of the American Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), \"we had a new typesetter and \"troff\" had just been invented and we were intoxicated by being able to produce small caps\". Many of the operating system's predecessors and contemporaries used all-uppercase lettering, so many people wrote the name in upper case due to force of habit. It is not an acronym.\nTrademark names can be registered by different entities in different countries and trademark laws in some countries allow the same trademark name to be controlled by two different entities if each entity uses the trademark in easily distinguishable categories. The result is that Unix has been used as a brand name for various products including bookshelves, ink pens, bottled glue, diapers, hair driers and food containers.\nSeveral plural forms of Unix are used casually to refer to multiple brands of Unix and Unix-like systems. Most common is the conventional \"Unixes\", but \"Unices\", treating Unix as a Latin noun of the third declension, is also popular. The pseudo-Anglo-Saxon plural form \"Unixen\" is not common, although occasionally seen. Sun Microsystems, developer of the Solaris variant, has asserted that the term \"Unix\" is itself plural, referencing its many implementations."}
{"title": "Commodore_DOS", "label": "Software", "text": "Commodore DOS, also known as CBM DOS, is the disk operating system used with Commodore's 8-bit computers. Unlike most other DOSes, which are loaded from disk into the computer's own RAM and executed there, CBM DOS is executed internally in the drive: the DOS resides in ROM chips inside the drive, and is run there by one or more dedicated MOS 6502 family CPUs. Thus, data transfer between Commodore 8-bit computers and their disk drives more closely resembles a local area network connection than typical disk/host transfers.\nCBM DOS versions.\nAt least seven distinctly numbered versions of Commodore DOS are known to exist; the following list gives the version numbers and related disk drives. Unless otherwise noted, drives are 5\u00bc-inch format. The \"lp\" code designates \"low-profile\" drives. Drives whose model number starts with 15 connect via Commodore's unique serial IEEE-488 bus (IEC Bus) serial (TALK/LISTEN) protocols; all others use the parallel IEEE-488.\nVersion 2.6 was by far the most commonly used and widely known DOS version, due to its use in the 1541 as part of C64 systems.\nNote: The revised firmware for the 1571 which fixed the relative file bug was \"also\" identified as V3.0. Thus it is not possible to differentiate the two versions using the version number alone.\nTechnical overview.\n1541 directory and file types.\nThe 1541 Commodore floppy disk can contain up to 144 files in a flat namespace (no subdirectories); the directory is stored on reserved track 18, which is located halfway from the hub to the edge of a 35-track single-sided disk. A file name may be up to 16 bytes in length and is theoretically unique; by using direct access methods on the directory structure, it is possible to rename a file to that of another\u2014although accessing such files may be difficult or impossible. Files with identical names usually serve no purpose except to inform or visually manage files. One popular trick, used, for example, by The Final Cartridge III, was to add files named codice_1 of type codice_2 to the directory, and files could then be rearranged around those lines to form groups. Many game developers, warez group members, and demoscene hackers used some more clever custom directory entries as well.\nFile names may contain a shifted space character (codice_3), and if the directory listing is being viewed from BASIC, the portion of the file name beyond the codice_3 character will appear to have been separated from the first part of the file name by a quotation mark, causing BASIC to not consider it to be part of the full file name. This feature can be used to create directory entries such as , which will then appear in the directory listing as, for example, . When the user moves the cursor to the beginning of the line, types the word codice_5 over the file size, and presses , BASIC interprets that as , causing the program to be loaded into memory. Anything after the colon or the secondary address will not be executed, since the computer ignores any command after a LOAD. Alternatively, the user could press to and the program automatically.\nA null byte embedded in a file name will interrupt the listing after loading by BASIC. If there are three null bytes, that makes it difficult to list through BASIC. Many machine language programmers would experiment with null bytes in an attempt to make it harder for BASIC programmers to access their code and tamper with it.\nIn BASIC, the directory can be accessed as a non-executable pseudo-BASIC program with (or in the case of a dual drive) followed by codice_6. The first line has a line number of 0 or 1 (indicating the drive number), showing in reverse video the name and ID of the disk and a shorthand code for the DOS version with which it was created (codes vary only as far as the DOS versions use incompatible disk formats: \"2A\" is used by most 5.25-inch DOS versions, \"3D\" by the-3.5 inch 1581). Lines after this have the size of a file (in disk blocks) as their pseudo \"line number\", followed by the file name in quotes and the three-letter type code. The last line shows the number of unallocated blocks on the disk (again as a pseudo \"line number\"), followed by the words \"BLOCKS FREE.\"\nOn the Commodore 64, entering will flood the screen with garbage instead of loading the directory into BASIC RAM. This is because the drive assigns the directory a load address of $0401 (1025), which is equivalent to the start of BASIC for the Commodore PET, but corresponds to the default screen memory in the C64 (starting with the second character on the first line of the screen).\nViewing the directory with a command overwrites the BASIC program in memory. The DOS Wedge and various third-party cartridges and extenders such as Epyx Fast Load, Action Replay, and The Final Cartridge III allow viewing of the disk directory using special commands that load the directory into screen memory without destroying the current BASIC program. Some versions of Commodore BASIC include a codice_7 or codice_8 command that performs the same function.\nThe following file types are supported:\n A sequential file is a data file that can be linearly read from start to finish. codice_9 files are commonly used to store documents or text files created by a word processor or other such editor. A sequential file is analogous to a flat file in Linux or UNIX, in that it has no specialized internal structure. It is not possible to position to any arbitrary location in a sequential file, as there is no analog of the codice_11 kernel call found in UNIX-like operating systems.\n codice_12 files normally contain executable program code, although they can also be used for data files. The first two bytes of the codice_12 are read by the kernal \"load file\" routine and used to determine the load address (they are stored in a little endian format).\n A relative file is a variation of the sequential file type, in which an indexing mechanism referred to as side-sectors is present to permit record-oriented access. Records may be a maximum of 254 bytes in size and are addressed by a one-based cardinal number, permitting true random access to any part of the file.\n A user-specified file has an internal structure that is identical to that of a sequential file. Commodore's original purpose for this file type was the facilitation of DOS development, as the file content could be copied into a drive buffer for execution by the drive's microprocessor. Very few programs ever made use of this file type. Some applications that use non-standard low-level disk structures save data in USR format, which came to be considered a sort of \"leave me alone, don't try to copy or delete\" indication to the user. Most notably, GEOS' \"VLIR\" files show up as codice_16 files.\n An undocumented internally used file type similar in structure to a sequential file. Creation of this file type must be accomplished by direct manipulation of the disk directory.\nThe presence of an asterisk (codice_19) prepended to the file type in a directory listing (for example, codice_20) indicates that the file was not properly closed after writing. When the drive is commanded to close a file that has been opened for writing, the associated buffer is flushed to the disk and the block availability map (BAM) is updated to accurately reflect which blocks have been used. If a program crash or other problem (such as the user removing the disk while a file is open) results in an \"orphan file\", also referred to as a \"poison\" or \"splat\" file, buffers are not flushed and the BAM will not accurately reflect disk usage, putting the disk at risk of corruption. A poison file generally cannot be accessed (but can be opened in \"modify\" mode), and an attempt to use the DOS codice_21 command to delete the file may cause filesystem corruption, such as crosslinking. The only practical method of removing one of these files is by opening the file in \"modify\" mode (and fixing it), or by validating the disk (see the DOS codice_22 command below), the latter which rebuilds the BAM and removes poison file references from the directory. The infamous save-with-replace bug could result in creation of splat files.\ncodice_23 is a special type written into the on-disk directory entry of files that have been deleted. Such files are not shown in a normal directory listing, and their data blocks and directory entries will be reused by files that are subsequently created. Some utility programs allow the \"un-deletion\" of such files if their data blocks and directory entries haven not yet been overwritten by other files. codice_24 are commonly used to insert banners or comment sections into a directory listing.\nFile types with codice_25 after them (for example, codice_26) are \"locked\", and cannot be deleted\u2014they can be opened for reading, however. There is no Commodore DOS command that can explicitly set or clear this status, but many third-party utilities were written to allow this to be done. These utilities generally read the directory using direct-access commands, perform the necessary modifications to the raw data, and then write the changes back to the disk.\nFile access.\nAccessing files is primarily an issue for the host computer. The kernal ROM in the computer contains the necessary primitive routines needed to access files, and the BASIC ROM contains a higher level abstraction for file access using BASIC syntax. The components that concern the DOS itself are file name parsing and the secondary address. This section will give an overview of the necessary BASIC commands for the sake of completeness.\nOpening a file on a Commodore disk unit entails the processing of a number of parameters that are vaguely analogous to file opening procedures in other environments. Since the DOS is actually running in the drive's controller, the file opening sequence must pass enough information to the drive to assure unambiguous interpretation. A typical statement in BASIC to write to a sequential file would be as follows:\nThe parameters following the codice_27 verb are as follows:\nThis parameter, the \"file number\", logically identifies the opened file within the \"computer's\" operating system and is analogous to a file descriptor in UNIX-like operating systems. It is never sent to the drive and thus is neither known nor used by the drive's own operating system. The file number may be in the range of 1 to 254 inclusive, is assigned by the programmer and must be unique if more than one file is simultaneously opened. Once the file has been opened all program input and output procedures use the file number. In assembly language programs, this value is often referred to as LA (logical address), the abbreviation coming from the mnemonic that refers to the memory location where the file number is stored. File numbers greater than 127 cause the system to write an extra line feed after each carriage return (useful for double spacing a document, as an example.)\nThis parameter, the \"device number\", identifies a specific peripheral attached to the computer. Devices 0 through 3 address the keyboard, tape cassette, RS-232 interface, and video display, respectively, all of which are directly controlled by the kernal ROM. Device numbers 4 and higher address devices attached to the peripheral bus, such as printers or disk drives. In the case of a disk drive, the device number refers to the unit's controller, not the drive mechanism(s) within the unit. By convention, the first disk drive unit on a system has device number 8, the second drive, if present, 9, etc., up to a maximum number of 15 (when eight disk drives are attached). The device number scheme was derived from the IEEE-488 (or general purpose interface GPIB) bus that was used with the Commodore PET/CBM models. In assembly language programs, this value is often referred to as FA or PA (physical address), again from the mnemonic for the memory location where the device number is stored.\nThis parameter, the \"secondary address\", which may range from 0 to 15 inclusive, refers to a specific communication channel established with the device's controller and is passed to the device when it is commanded to \"talk\" or \"listen\" on the peripheral bus. As with the file number, the secondary address is determined by the programmer and must be unique for the device in question. The range 0 to 14 inclusive is used for passing data to or from the device, whereas 15, referred to as the \"command channel\", is used to issue commands to the device's controller (such as to rename a disk file), if the device is able to support such an operation. In disk drives, secondary addresses 0 to 14 inclusive are mapped to buffers within the controller, hence establishing communication with a specific file on a specific disk; since as mentioned above the drive does not know about the \"file number\", it can only use the \"secondary address\" to make a difference between several files that are open at the same time. On the other hand, the host operating system is agnostic about the secondary address; it is transmitted to the drive on every access to the file, but not otherwise used by the host. In assembly language programs, this value is often referred to as SA (secondary address).\nThe codice_28 parameter is officially referred to in Commodore documentation as the \"command string\" and is interpreted by the controller of the device being accessed. In the case of a disk drive unit, the formal command string structure consists of the drive mechanism number (codice_29, not to be confused with the device number), filename (codice_30), file type (codice_31, sequential in this example) and access mode (codice_32, opened for writing in this example). In practice, some of these parameters may be omitted. Minimally, only the filename is required if the file is to be opened for reading.\nThe drive number identifies a drive mechanism attached to a disk unit's controller and is analogous to a logical unit number in a SCSI controller that is capable of controlling multiple mechanisms (e.g., the OMTI SASI controllers that were developed to work with ST-412/ST-506 hard drives in the 1980s). In floppy disk units, the first mechanism is drive 0: and the second is 1:. It is fairly common practice to omit the drive number when communicating with a single drive floppy unit, as 0: is the default in such units, but since omitting the number can trigger a few obscure bugs in the DOS it is not a recommended practice (a colon alone is equivalent to 0: and is enough to avoid those bugs). An exception to this convention is with the Lt. Kernal hard disk subsystem, in which the drive number refers to \"logical units\" (virtual drives created on a single physical drive), which made syntax such as 4: or 10: necessary if a file to be opened was not on logical unit zero (equivalent to drive mechanism zero in a dual floppy unit).\nFiles can also be loaded and saved to with codice_5 and codice_34 commands. File name specifiers can also be used here, for example, saves the BASIC program to a codice_12 (program) file and saves the BASIC program to a sequential file. If the secondary address isn't specified or is specified as 0 (e.g. ), the file is saved/loaded from the BASIC memory area (which, on the C64, starts by default at $0801). If the secondary address is specified as a non-zero value (e.g. ), the program is loaded starting from the address specified by the file itself (the PRG header, which is the first two bytes of the file)\u2014this form of command is more common when loading machine code programs.\nLoad relocation was first introduced on the VIC-20 because this machine could start BASIC RAM in several different locations, depending on the memory expansion that was installed. The older Commodore PET series did not support relocation, so and would have the same effect: the file would be loaded into the same memory region from which it was saved. Load relocation happens in the host, being an exception to what is said above about the secondary address being used only device-internally. Since the PET cannot relocate files, BASIC programs written on later Commodore machines must be modified by using a sector editor to change the header bytes. It is also possible to use the PET's built-in machine language monitor to change the link address for the BASIC program after loading it.\nThe command will load the first program on the disk starting from the file-specified memory location. This is one of the most popular load commands of the platforms, the method to start majority of commercial software, for example. Of note is the fact that the wildcard expansion will only pick the first catalog name when no other file on that disk has been accessed before; the name of the last-used file is kept in memory, and subsequent commands will load that file rather than the first. (However, or will always load the first file on the disk.)\nThe directories of disks in two-drive units are accessed as and . codice_36 and codice_37 do not access the directory but actual files on one drive or the other that just happen to be named codice_38. Partial directories can be loaded by adding a colon and a template: for example, would load a partial directory that shows only the files whose name starts with the letter K and which are of type PRG; all such partial directories still contain the initial disk name line and the final \"BLOCKS FREE\" line.\nThe save-with-replace bug.\nCommodore DOS also offers a \"Save-with-Replace\" command, which allows a file to be saved over an existing file without the need to first codice_39 the existing file. This was done by prepending an codice_40 symbol to the file name during the codice_27 or codice_34 operation - for instance, . For years rumors spread, beginning with the 4040 drive, of a bug in the command's implementation. At first, this was denied by some commentators. Prizes were offered to prove the existence of the bug. By early 1985 \"Compute!\" magazine advised readers to avoid using the command. That year various authors independently published articles proving that the Save-with-Replace bug was real and including methods by which it could be triggered.\nAffected devices included the single-drive 1541 and dual-drive 4040; the 8050 and 8250 did not exhibit the issue. Some commentators suggested the bug could be avoided by always explicitly specifying the codice_29 drive number when saving, though it was later shown that \"any\" disk operations without a drive number were sufficient to lead to the bug. The bug stemmed from the fact that the affected DOS implementations were modified versions of the DOS contained in earlier Commodore PET dual drives such as the 8050. This created a \"phantom drive codice_44\" on single-drive systems, resulting in the allocation of an unnecessary buffer under some conditions. Since the Save-with-Replace command used all five drive buffers, and because the method by which the \"phantom\" buffer was allocated did not meet specifications, this resulted in scrambled data being written to the disk under some conditions.\nIn September 1986, Philip A. Slaymaker published an article describing in great detail the cause of the bug and providing patches to the 1541 drive ROMs; readers with an EPROM burner could produce their own patched ROMs which could be swapped into the drive. Commodore was made aware of Slaymaker's findings, and while they never issued an official update for the original 1541's ROMs, they did fix the bug in Revision 5 of the 1571 ROMs, and also in the ROMs for the 1541-c and 1541-II drives. Although not supported by Commodore, it is known that the 1541-II firmware (but not that of the 1541-c) can also be used in an original 1541 drive by using EPROMs, which will fix the bug for that drive as well.\nCommand channel.\nAs previously noted, the Commodore DOS itself is accessed via the \"command channel\", using syntax like that used to access files. Issuing commands to the DOS and retrieving status and error messages generated in response to commands is accomplished by opening a file to the device using 15 as the secondary address, for example:\nTo retrieve and display the device status, one could code:\nIn the above example, codice_45 will hold the error number (if any, it will be zero if no error exists), codice_46 will be a terse text description of the error, codice_47 will represent the disk track where the error occurred, and codice_31 will be the sector on track codice_47 to which the error refers. If no error exists, the equivalent of will be returned in the four variables. Note that codice_50 is a run mode only verb. Also, in programs that issue many disk commands it is customary to open a file to the device's command channel at the start of the program and not close it until the program has finished.\nCommodore BASIC versions 4.0 and later provide a pseudo-variable referred to as codice_51 that may be used to retrieve drive status in lieu of the above code. This reserved variable is not available on earlier versions of BASIC, so the command channel must be manually read as demonstrated above. Note that immediately after power-on or reset, the DOS revision will be returned. For example, a 1541 will return . Error code 73 is common to all drive models and may be used to determine if the drive has been reset to its power-on state.\nDOS commands.\nThere are also a command for seeking in RELative type files (codice_52), several block-level direct-access commands (codice_53, codice_54, codice_55), block management (codice_56, codice_57), drive memory manipulation and execution of program code on the drive's processor (codice_58, codice_59, codice_60, codice_61) and user-definable functions (codice_62 and codice_63 commands). Some of the theoretically user-definable functions were rededicated for accessing new functionality in DOS versions after 1.0."}
{"title": "IOS_9", "label": "Software", "text": "iOS 9 is the ninth major release of the iOS mobile operating system developed by Apple Inc., being the successor to iOS 8. It was announced at the company's Worldwide Developers Conference on June 8, 2015, and was released on September 16, 2015. It was succeeded by iOS 10 on September 13, 2016.\niOS 9 incorporated many feature updates to built-in apps. Most notably, Notes received the ability to draw sketches with different tools, image insertion, prominent visual appearance for website links and map locations, and advanced list formatting; an all-new Apple News app aggregates articles from different sources; and Apple Maps received mass transit support, although in a limited number of locations at launch. Major new system updates include proactivity, where Siri and advanced search are combined to make the operating system more contextually aware of information (such as time and location), and can provide the user with information ahead of time. For searching, the proactive intelligence can display instant results in a widget-like format, including weather, sports, news, and more. iOS 9 also added multiple forms of multitasking to the iPad. In iOS 9.3, Apple added a Night Shift mode that changes the color of the device's display to a warmer, less \"blue light\" containing shade, to reduce any negative eye health effects on users' circadian rhythms. Additionally, iOS 9 brought new user experience functions, including Quick Actions, and Peek and Pop, based on the touch-sensitive display technology in the iPhone 6S. Quick Actions are shortcuts on home screen app icons. Users can preview (\"Peek\") at content without moving away from the current screen before they enter (\"Pop\") the previewed content into full view.\nReception of iOS 9 was positive. Critics praised proactivity and Siri for making the Notification Center a central location for all information, and the potential for future updates to improve the functionality. The new multitasking features for the iPad were complimented, as were drawing and photo insertion in the Notes app. However, Apple News was criticized for a low number of decent-looking articles, and Apple Maps was criticized for the limited geographical availability of mass transit support.\nFive days after release, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, which Apple described as the \"fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\nHistory.\nIntroduction and initial release.\niOS 9 was introduced at the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference on June 8, 2015, with the first beta made available to registered developers after the keynote, and a public beta made available in July. This marked the first time that the general public had been able to test new versions of iOS before official release, with Eddy Cue, Apple's Senior Vice President of Internet Software and Services, telling \"Fast Company\" that the public beta program was started \"because of Maps\", referring to the company's Apple Maps launch that had significant issues in its early days.\niOS 9 was officially released on September 16, 2015.\nSystem features.\n3D Touch.\nOn the iPhone 6S and iPhone 6S Plus, a touch-sensitive display feature called 3D Touch is incorporated into iOS 9. It is similar to Force Touch, which can be found on the trackpad of some Apple MacBook computers. Quick Actions and shortcuts are added to apps that support the 3D Touch feature and are triggered by pressing slightly harder on the app icon. It also introduces actions known as Peek and Pop, which lets users firmly hold to preview (\"Peek\") any kind of content in a hovering window, before they optionally apply more pressure to enter (\"Pop\") the content into full view.\nThe taptic engine in the iPhone 6S provides haptic feedback each time users press the screen harder.\nBattery.\niOS 9 comes with two important battery-saving updates. When a phone has been placed face-down, the screen will not light up upon receiving notifications. Apple has also added Low Power Mode, which modifies the amount of energy dedicated to background services and animations. For example, background app refresh and push email are paused during Low Power Mode. When a phone reaches 20% battery level, users are automatically prompted to turn on Low Power Mode, which changes the color of the battery icon in the top row status bar on the screen to yellow. When the battery goes higher than the 80% level, Low Power Mode automatically turns back off.\nDesign.\nSan Francisco, a new system font, replaced Helvetica Neue as the system typeface of iOS.\niOS 9 added a new battery widget to the Notification Center that displayed the battery life and charging status of any connected Bluetooth device.\nWhen the shift button is inactive, lowercase letters are displayed on the keyboard, instead of the all-caps representation on previous iOS versions.\nInstallation.\niOS 9 is a smaller update than iOS 8, requiring 1.3\u00a0GB of space, compared to 4.58\u00a0GB for iOS 8. Additionally, iOS 9 includes an option to temporarily delete apps to allow the update to install. Once the update has been installed, the apps will be automatically restored. iOS 9 also features \"app thinning\" functionality, whereby only the necessary assets needed to run apps on each individual device is downloaded rather than the entire app, potentially saving space.\nMultitasking.\niOS 9 adds a number of features to the iPad to improve productivity. These include Slide Over, Split Screen, and Picture in Picture, for enhanced multitasking, similar to the experience found on OS X El Capitan. Slide Over allows the user to pull in a second app with a swipe from the right edge of the display. This app takes up 1/3 of the screen and sticks to the right side of the screen, while interactivity within the full-screen app is disabled while left inactive in the background. The feature allows users to perform quick tasks and then dismiss the app again.\nIf the user taps on the handle next to the Slide Over window or extends the window further towards the left of the screen, the user enters Split Screen, which allows them to interact with two apps simultaneously side-by-side in a 50/50 split. Users can also switch to another app in either Slide Over mode or Split Screen view by pulling down on the handle on top of either app and selecting another app from the list to replace the existing one.\nPicture in Picture mode allows users to minimize FaceTime calls or supported videos to a smaller window and continue watching them while doing other tasks on the iPad.\nThe Split Screen multitasking feature is only available for iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4, and iPad Pro, while the Slide Over and Picture in Picture features are available on the iPad Air, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 2 and newer, and the iPad Pro.\nWhen banner notifications are tapped, causing another app to open, a back button at the top-left corner of the screen has been added, bringing the user back to the previous app.\nNight Shift.\nNight Shift is a display mode introduced in iOS 9.3. The mode shifts the colors of the device's display to be warmer, similar to F.lux, a popular program for Microsoft Windows and Apple macOS computers. When enabled, it uses the device's clock and geographic location to determine when to turn the feature on or off. Optionally, the user can set a manual schedule, or not have a schedule at all. For ease of access, there is a new Night Shift toggle in the Control Center. The settings for Night Shift are located under \"Display and Brightness\" in the Settings app, and on top of enabling the feature and setting a schedule, the user can also set the warmth of the display.\nDespite being introduced in iOS 9.3 in March 2016, it wasn't possible to use Night Shift and Low Power Mode simultaneously until the release of iOS 9.3.2 two months later. Night Shift requires a 64-bit processor only found in the Apple A7 or newer chips, which means older iOS devices, including the iPhone 4S, iPhone 5, iPhone 5C, iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad 4, first-generation iPad Mini, and 5th generation iPod Touch, do not receive Night Shift mode.\nPerformance.\niOS 9 includes performance and speed improvements thanks to the expanded use of the Metal API. Metal was introduced in iOS 8 and was previously limited to game developers. In iOS 9, the use of Metal is expanded to let it handle many of the core user interface elements and graphics.\nProactivity.\nIntelligence is one of the main features in iOS 9, consisting of the newly integrated Siri and Search (previously known as Spotlight), as well as \"proactivity\" throughout the operating system. iOS is now more aware of contextual information (such as time and location), and proactively provides the user with what they may need in advance to save them time and effort. When typing, Search has also been improved to display instant answers in an at-a-glance, widget-like format, similar to that provided in the Siri interface. Search can display current weather, sports scores, news, and more. The Search screen with proactive suggestions can be accessed either by pulling down the notifications window, in the Safari web browser through the search bar, and to the left on the home screen.\nThe intelligence also extends into apps. For instance, in Mail, events can be automatically added to Calendar if details are found in the message content, and likely additional recipients are suggested during message composition. Siri is also aware of what is currently on screen when it is engaged by holding down the home button.\nSecurity.\niOS 9 introduces multiple security enhancements. It introduces a 6-digit passcode as a default, an extra two digits from the previous 4-digit default, as well as support for two-factor authentication.\nThe original iOS 9 release in September 2015 fixed a security issue within previous iOS versions where a \"flaw allowed anyone within range of an AirDrop user to install malware on a target device and tweak iOS settings so the exploit would still work if the victim rejected an incoming AirDrop file\".\nSettings.\nThe Settings app in iOS 9 has a search bar that makes it easier to find settings and options. The user also has options to have notifications be grouped by which app they came from, and the ability to turn on or off Shake to Undo.\nOther changes.\nOn iPad, a two-finger drag on the keyboard moves the cursor freely like a traditional trackpad, making positioning the cursor and selecting text easier. The keyboard-to-trackpad feature is also extended to iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, in which users can 3D Touch (force press) the keyboard to enable the trackpad. Also on the iPad, a shortcut bar has been added for cut, copy, paste, undo, and redo functions, and folders display 16 apps per page in a 4-by-4 arrangement, compared to 9 on the iPhone, allowing for an increased total of 240 apps in a single folder.\niOS 9 introduced Wi-Fi Assist, a feature, on by default, that automatically switches the phone to cellular data when the Wi-Fi connection is spotty.\nWhenever the user is presented with flight information, the user can click on a link to view a preview for that flight.\nApp features.\niBooks.\nAs of iOS 9.3, PDFs saved to the iBooks application via Safari or iTunes can be synced with iCloud.\niCloud.\niOS 9 has a setting that enables an iCloud Drive app on the home screen. iCloud Drive lets the user save and browse files and folders in iCloud.\nHealth.\nThe Health app, introduced in iOS 8, has received landscape mode on iPhone. It also added support for reproductive health, UV exposure, water intake and sedentary state data types.\nIn iOS 9.3, it also tracks sleep, exercise, and weight from the Apple Watch.\nMessages.\nThe Messages (previously iChat) app allows the user to search for text and have that text be highlighted (and scrolled).\nMaps.\nApple Maps adds support for transit directions in Baltimore, Berlin, Chicago, London, Los Angeles, Mexico City, New York City, Paris, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Toronto, and Washington D.C., along with \"over 300 locations in China.\"\nThe Maps app now also has enhanced location details, including a Nearby feature that recommends shops, restaurants and places to drink in close proximity to the user. For places serving food, users can specify exactly what type of food they want.\nNews.\niOS 9 includes a new Apple News app (replacing the Newsstand app), which aggregates news from different sources in a similar style as Flipboard. The app features a \"mobile-formatted layout that loads quickly and has informative animations and full-bleed images\". Additionally, News supports RSS feeds from the Safari web browser. At launch, the News app was only available in the United States, but it was expanded to the United Kingdom and Australia with the iOS 9.1 update.\nIn March 2016, Apple opened the News platform to all news agencies, including independent bloggers.\nNotes.\nThe Notes app has received a number of enhancements in iOS 9, including the ability to draw sketches with a number of different tools, including a ruler for straight lines. Images can also be added, and links to websites and Map locations get a more prominent, visual appearance when added to notes. On the iPad, and on iPhone in landscape mode, Notes has a range of color options for drawing, as well as an eraser. Advanced formatting options including checked, bulleted, dashed and numbered lists.\nThe app also supports iCloud and allows for easy folder creation.\nA secure notes feature, introduced in iOS 9.3, lets an iOS user protect their notes with either a passcode or Touch ID.\nPhotos.\nThe Photos app on iOS 9 included the improved scrubber bar in the photo viewer, \"Screenshots\" and \"Selfies\" albums, and the ability to hold and select multiple photos easily, without having to delete them individually. It also allows the user to hide sensitive material through a new Hide option. The app also allows the user to pinch to zoom while playing a video.\nSafari.\nWith the release of iOS 9, the Safari web browser allows for third-party content blocking apps. Safari also allows users to customize the appearance of the Reader mode, with options for font and background color.\nA few days after the release of iOS 9, ad blocking software had topped the App Store charts, with Marco Arment, developer of a Peace app, saying that \"web advertising and behavioral tracking is out of control. They're unacceptably creepy, bloated, annoying, and insecure, and they're getting worse at an alarming pace.\"\nWallet.\nThe Passbook application was renamed Wallet in iOS 9 and includes many new changes, such as support for store loyalty cards, gift cards, Discover credit/debit cards, and Apple Pay in the UK. The Wallet app can also be accessed from the lock screen.\nDeveloper APIs.\nIn iOS 9.3, a \"Music API\" allows developers to integrate apps into the Apple Music streaming service.\nReception.\niOS 9 received mostly positive reviews. Dan Seifert of \"The Verge\" praised the improvements in Proactivity and Siri, highlighting how the notification drop-down contains most, if not all, the information the user needs. Although he pointed out that Google's Google Now and Microsoft's Cortana personal assistants offer similar services, sometimes with \"better and more varied ways\" of achieving results, the improvements to iOS \"lay the foundation for even more capabilities in the future.\" Chris Velazco of \"Engadget\" liked the \"small, thoughtful\" design changes, but was most impressed by the new multitasking features for the iPad, referring to Split Screen as a \"lovely little feature.\" He did, however, criticize the low number of decent-looking articles in Apple News, writing that \"you'll notice a discrepancy in how some articles are handled \u2013 most are just formatted text on a white background with the outlet's logo up top\" and also noted the limited number of locations in Apple Maps that, at launch, supported mass transit directions. Matt Swider of \"TechRadar\" wrote that Siri and Proactivity lists were \"robust,\" and enjoyed that notifications were sorted chronologically rather than by app. Samuel Gibbs of \"The Guardian\" welcomed the changes to the built-in apps such as drawing and photo insertion in Notes, unknown number identification from emails through Phone, and Siri automatically launching the Music app upon plugging in headphones. He also praised the updates to the keyboard, calling it \"much easier to use.\"\nApple is facing a $5 million lawsuit over allegedly slowing the iPhone 4S with iOS 9. This is because according to the lawsuit, the iOS 9 update slowed down the iPhone 4S to the point that the phone was unusable (as performance was sluggish) and that Apple knew this fact (planned obsolescence).\nOn September 21, 2015, Apple announced that iOS 9 had been installed on more than 50% of \"active\" iOS devices, as measured by the App Store. According to Apple, this was \"the fastest adoption rate ever for a new operating system\".\nProblems.\nError 53 bricking issue.\nIn February 2016, news outlets reported that users who updated to iOS 9 on a particular device that had components repaired by a third-party (notably the Touch ID fingerprint recognition sensor) rendered their phone unusable. The issue, named \"Error 53\", was, according to iFixIt, limited to iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices. Apple stated:\nWe protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the Touch ID sensor. When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the Touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. ... This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to Touch ID remain secure. Without this unique pairing, a malicious Touch ID sensor could be substituted, thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. When iOS detects that the pairing fails, Touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure.\nApple released a new version of iOS 9.2.1 later in February to fix the issue.\nDate reboot issue.\nIn February 2016, a bug was discovered that could render 64-bit devices unusable. The bug, caused by setting the time to January 1, 1970, would cause the device to get stuck in a reboot process until the battery died or the time setting shifted past January 1. A similar bug also applies to 32-bit devices, where the battery would report 0% of charge, and the Wi-Fi would be disabled. iOS 9.3, released on March 21, 2016, fixed the issue.\n9.7-inch iPad Pro bricking issue.\nIn May 2016, Apple released iOS 9.3.2. The update was followed by reports that it bricked some 9.7-inch iPad Pros, with a \"Connect to iTunes\" message, and an \"Error 56\" message in iTunes that it couldn't restore the tablet.\nApple temporarily stopped offering the 9.3.2 update, until a re-release of the version in June 2016 fixed the issue.\niBooks crash.\nThe release of iOS 9.3.3 in July 2016 was followed by reports that the iBooks store crashed. However, Apple explained in August that the timing was a coincidence, and the iBooks app crash was a result of a server issue, not the software update.\nSpyware attack.\nThe release of iOS 9.3.5 in August 2016 fixed three critical security vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities could be exploited to silently enable a jailbreak and allow the malicious installation of a spyware called \"Pegasus\". Pegasus could intercept and read text messages, emails, track calls, trace phone location, activate the microphone, and gather information from apps, including (but not limited to) iMessage, Gmail, Viber, Facebook, WhatsApp, Telegram, and Skype.\nThe discovery of the vulnerabilities dated 10 days before the 9.3.5 update was released. Arab human rights defender Ahmed Mansoor received a suspicious text message with a link and sent it to Citizen Lab. An investigation ensued with collaboration from Lookout that revealed that if Mansoor clicked the link, it would have jailbroken his phone and implanted it with the spyware. Citizen Lab linked the attack to an Israeli surveillance company known as NSO Group that sells Pegasus to governments for \"lawful interception.\"\nRegarding how widespread the issue was, Lookout explained in a blog post: \"We believe that this spyware has been in the wild for a significant amount of time based on some of the indicators within the code\" and pointed out that the code shows signs of a \"kernel mapping table that has values all the way back to iOS 7.\"\nNews of the spyware received significant media attention, particularly for being called the \"most sophisticated\" smartphone attack ever, and for being the first time in iPhone history that a remote jailbreak exploit has been detected.\n\"Broadpwn\" Wi-Fi vulnerability.\nIn July 2017, information on a critical Wi-Fi security vulnerability affecting 1 billion iOS and Android devices was published. The issue, named \"Broadpwn\", allows an attacker to remotely take control of nearby vulnerable devices and turn affected devices into \"rogue access points\", further spreading the infection to other nearby devices. Apple released a security patch for the issue as part of its iOS 10.3.3 update, though older devices running iOS 9, including the iPad 2, 3rd generation iPad, iPhone 4S, the first-generation iPad Mini, and the 5th generation iPod Touch were left without an available update, causing concerns over the safety of the iPad 2, 3rd generation iPad, and the first-generation iPad Mini in schools.\niPhone 4S lawsuit.\nOn December 22, 2015, Apple faced a class-action lawsuit for crippling the iPhone 4S with the iOS 9 update, with some people even going so far as to say that iOS 9 rendered their devices unusable. The 4S only had 512MB of RAM, so it could not handle the iOS 9 update. \nSupported devices.\nWith this release, Apple did not drop support for any iOS devices, with all devices supporting iOS 8 also able to run iOS 9."}
{"title": "Battle.net", "label": "Software", "text": "Battle.net is an Internet-based online game, social networking service, digital distribution, and digital rights management platform developed by Blizzard Entertainment. The service was launched on December 31, 1996, followed a few days later with the release of Blizzard's action-role-playing video game \"Diablo\" on January 3, 1997. Battle.net was officially renamed to \"Blizzard Battle.net\" in August 2017.\nBattle.net was the first online gaming service incorporated directly into the games that make use of it, in contrast to the external interfaces used by the other online services at the time. This feature, along with ease of account creations and the absence of member fees, caused Battle.net to become popular among gamers and became a major selling point for \"Diablo\" and subsequent Blizzard games. Since the successful launch of Battle.net, many companies have created online game services mimicking Blizzard's service package and the user interface.\nBlizzard Entertainment officially unveiled the revamped Battle.net 2.0 on March 20, 2009. It later revealed further details of the Battle.net revamped features at BlizzCon 2009 which supported \"World of Warcraft,\" \"StarCraft II\", and \"Diablo III\". The original Battle.net was then renamed to Battle.net Classic. Battle.net Classic games use a different account system to the games on Battle.net 2.0. \nThe platform currently supports storefront actions, social interactions, and matchmaking for all of Blizzard's modern PC games including \"Hearthstone\", \"Heroes of the Storm,\" \"Overwatch\", and ', as well as various \"Call of Duty\" games, and ' from corporate sibling of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision. The platform provides cross-game instant messaging and voice chat service.\nIn September 2017, Blizzard Entertainment released the Battle.net application for Android and iOS. The app includes the ability to chat with and add friends in addition to seeing what games they are currently playing.\nHistory.\nBattle.net Classic.\nWhen the service initially launched on December 31, 1996 (the first game using the service being \"Diablo\" releasing a few days later on January 3, 1997), Battle.net offered only a few basic services like chatting and game listings. Players could connect to the service, talk with other gamers and join multiplayer games of \"Diablo\". Besides user account data, no game data was stored on the Battle.net servers. When a player connected to a game, they would be connecting directly to the other players in the game. No data was sent through the Battle.net servers. While this made the service quick and easy to use, it quickly led to widespread cheating since players using cheats could modify their game data locally. However, since there was an option to create private games, many players ended up playing with people they knew.\nThe release of \"StarCraft\" in 1998 increased usage of the Battle.net service significantly. Features such as ladder ranking and game filters were added to the service. Battle.net grew even larger after the release of the expansion pack \"\", with tens of thousands of players logged on at any given time (even in the present day). \"StarCraft\" Battle.net was especially successful in South Korea, where the number of players logged on was often many times that of the United States.\n\"StarCraft\" also brought with it a new copy protection scheme using CD keys. Under \"Diablo\", Battle.net would allow any client to connect to the service. With \"StarCraft\", only those players with a valid and unique CD key \u2013 a generated 13-digit number distributed with each boxed game \u2013 were allowed onto the service. Only one person could connect to Battle.net using a specific CD key at a time. CD-Keys could also be muted (unable to chat in channels or whisper), voided (restricted to \"The Void\" channel), jailed (both muted and voided) or banned from Battle.net entirely. Every Blizzard game since \"StarCraft\" has used the CD key system to connect to Battle.net. \"StarCraft: Brood War\" used as its CD-key whatever CD-key was found on the original \"StarCraft\" on that computer, and was thus only installable if the original was already installed. With the release of the Gateway system in \"Brood War\" (selectable regional server clusters), two players can play at the same time, as long as they are on different gateways. Given how the gateways are expectedly separate from each other, each with their own games list and user accounts that are not shared across the other gateways, it is still maintained that they cannot play in the same game nor chat with each other, etc.\n\"Diablo II\" was released in 2000 to much fanfare. The main highlight of \"Diablo II\" as it relates to Battle.net was that the game used the client\u2013server model. The game was no longer simulated on each player's computer, but instead was run on Blizzard's server. This also meant that all of the character data for the game was stored on the Battle.net servers. The game also has an open character feature on Battle.net which stored the player's character on the client. This allowed players to play characters locally or on a LAN, and then use those same characters on Battle.net. However, any open games played on Battle.net were not protected from cheating by other players since they could have modified their characters locally. \"Diablo II\" also had a unique feature that would show the players in the Battle.net chat room as avatars who looked like their characters did in the game. It also used a different Battle.net interface than previous games, where previously there were mainly only color differences. There was also expanded ladder support including a \"Hardcore\" ladder which listed players whose characters would be removed permanently if they died in-game. Again, with \"Diablo II\" usage of Battle.net increased steadily, climbing even higher with the release of the expansion pack \"\" in 2001.\n' was released in 2002 and its expansion pack, ', was released in 2003. The release of these two games brought with them a number of new features to the online service. The most significant feature to be added was probably the concept of Anonymous Matchmaking. This feature allowed a user who wanted to play a game to simply press a button and automatically be matched up with one or more other players who were similar in skill (based on ranking) and also wanted to play a game. This allowed for people to get into games quickly and easily. It also reduced win-trading, where two people would purposely win and lose games to artificially raise their rank on the ladder. The matchmaking concept was also expanded to team games in a feature called \"Arranged Teams\". In an arranged team game, you could make a team with one or more friends, which was then anonymously matched up with another team of the same size and rank. However, a strategy was introduced on how to cheat the automated 'fair' matchups, called 'Abusing', simply by someone losing the Arranged Team Games intentionally with one ally so that with another ally (who wants to gain wins easily) won't find it difficult because the automatic matchups would put the two players up against relatively unskilled players. Automated tournaments were added in the expansion, where players would compete to be crowned tournament champion in a series of games played throughout the day. In addition to the new game styles, a slew of other features were added including selectable chatroom icons unlocked based on the player's number of wins, a friends list, and clan support.\nBattle.net 2.0.\n\"Battle.net\" was revamped by Blizzard Entertainment in 2009 and officially unveiled on March 20, 2009, it was further elaborated on during BlizzCon 2009. The new Battle.net contains three unique sections. The first allows players to connect all Battle.net accounts, World of Warcraft characters and friends list together and integrate them into a unified single Battle.net account. Players can also unlock achievements in-game which would in turn unlock avatars and decals which would be shown on the player's profile, the decals can also be seen in-game on the player's units.\nThe second section consists of making Battle.net into a competitive platform for players which involves a new improved matchmaking system, simplifying the process of players organizing games. The ladder system has also been revamped; the system classifies players into certain leagues according to their level of competitiveness. Players would then compete against others who have a similar skill level to their own, albeit across leagues. There is also a special practice league to practice and hone skills, where game speed is reduced and maps are designed to create a slower pace of the game. The party system works similar to that of \"World of Warcraft\" where players with friends would join together and enter games as a party.\nThe final section involves the new chat system which involves a new system similar to instant messaging across games. Players may communicate with friends across games, servers, and characters.\n\"World of Warcraft\" initially did not support Battle.net, having separate accounts from \"Battle.net\" once until the revamp of Battle.net on March 20, 2009 which forced players to merge their \"World of Warcraft\" accounts with the new Battle.net accounts. The features of Battle.net utilized in \"World of Warcraft\" include allowing players to engage in cross-realm, cross-faction and cross-game chat, which allows players to talk with their friends on their Real ID friends list, from other factions, other servers as well as other games such as StarCraft II\" and \"Diablo III\". On November 11, 2009 Blizzard Entertainment made Battle.net a mandatory feature for \"World of Warcraft\" players.\n\"StarCraft II\" was the first game to natively support the new revamped Battle.net online interface. It was split into three installments: the base game with the subtitle ', expansion pack ', stand-alone expansion pack ' and downloadable content mission packs '. \nThe new interface includes a chat service which is similar to that of instant messengers which allows players to interact across different games. The platform also supports VoIP for players.\nOn May 5, 2010, Blizzard revealed that Battle.net 2.0 would be integrated with social networking site Facebook, \"linking the world's premier online gaming platform with the world's most popular social platform\".\nBlizzard Battle.net Desktop App.\nIn August 2013, Blizzard Entertainment released an open beta for the Battle.net Launcher. The launcher is a desktop application that allows players to purchase, install and patch their games, and provides access to the friends list and messaging. It also provides access to some account management and game services. Blizzard launches its own cross-game voice chat service in October 2016. Blizzard Voice is integrated into the Battle.net application.\nIn February 2017, Blizzard introduced the ability to obtain Blizzard storefront credit by trading in \"WoW Tokens\" from \"World of Warcraft\", bought through the use of in-game gold and initially used as a means of trading credits between players of \"World of Warcraft\". These credits could be used to purchase other Blizzard games or content, such as card packs for \"Hearthstone\" or loot boxes for \"Overwatch\".\nThe Windows version of \"Destiny 2\", developed by Bungie and published by corporate sibling of Blizzard Entertainment, Activision, was exclusively sold and launched through the Battle.net on its Windows release on October 24, 2017 as well as used to support the game's matchmaking capabilities, making it the first non-Blizzard game supported by the launcher. Blizzard affirmed that players can use gold farming in \"World of Warcraft\" to generate credit towards their Blizzard account that they can use towards purchase of \"Destiny 2\". Blizzard said that they are also \"potentially evaluating needs or opportunities for future Activision games\" to be supported by the Battle.net; with \"\", scheduled for release in late 2018, as its second title for the service. Blizzard said it does not plan to extend similar support to other third-parties, fearing it would weaken their quality control with the product. \n\"Destiny 2\" was removed from Battle.net on October 1, 2019, after Bungie and Activision amicably terminated the publishing deal, with Bungie transitioning players to use Steam instead after that date.\nA major user interface update for Battle.net was issued in January 2021, aimed to provide better visibility of news and a user's friends list, accessibility features, and navigation features.\nBlizzard Battle.net Mobile App.\nIn September 2017, Blizzard Entertainment released Battle.net application for Android and iOS. The app provides simple social networking features with a user's friends on Battle.net, including accepting and sending friend invitations and chatting with friends.\nRebranding.\nIn late 2016, Blizzard Entertainment announced plans to rebrand Battle.net. According to CEO Mike Morhaime, the company found themselves in a position where they had two competing brands - Blizzard and Battle.net - creating confusion for players of where to find information about their games, and wanted to consolidate the branding. Their first step was a plan to retire the \"Battle.net\" name in favor of calling service \"Blizzard Tech\", announced on September 21, 2016, and renaming the client as the \"Blizzard App\" by March 24, 2017. However, following this change, Blizzard realized that the \"Battle.net\" brand had too much legacy behind it to let it go since dropping the brand created additional confusion for users. This further became an issue when Blizzard sought to have \"Destiny 2\" use the service, as they wanted to be clear that the game was not developed by Blizzard but used the Battle.net framework, but the \"Blizzard App\" branding would not provide that clarity. By August 2017, Blizzard Entertainment stepped back from the full rebranding, and announced that going forward, they would call the service and application \"Blizzard Battle.net\", which Morhaime said was the best way they had found to combine both brands and minimize consumer confusion. By February 2021, Blizzard Entertainment released a new interface and rebranded the application \"Battle.net\" to its original name.\nDevelopment.\nSecurity.\nTo help users protect their Battle.net accounts, Blizzard Entertainment implemented a two-factor authentication option for the service. Launched in 2008, this was initially through a separate device that could be purchased from Blizzard, encoded with the user's credentials. The device fit on a keychain and would generate pseudorandom numbers linked to the player's account, which they would enter when logging into Battle.net to affirm their identity. Later, Blizzard introduced the Battle.net mobile application for iOS and Android platforms in 2009, replicating the same functionality. An update during June 2016 simplified the process, allowing the user, when logging into their Battle.net account from a computer, to simply press a single button on their connected mobile device to affirm their authenticity. Though not required to use Battle.net, some game aspects require the user to enable two-factor authentication through either the device or mobile app.\nGrowth history.\nBy November 1997, Blizzard Entertainment claimed that \"Battle.net\" had 2.2 million games played, 1.25 million different users, and averaged 3,500 new users each day. By April 1999, it was reported that Battle.net had 2.3 million \"active\" users, and more than 50,000 concurrent users. By September 2002, their active user count had jumped to 11 million. By September 2004, their active user count was up to nearly 12 million, spending more than 2.1 million hours online each day, and they had an average of 200,000 concurrent users, with a peak concurrent user count of 400,000. In 2006, Blizzard claimed that Battle.net, when combined with the \"World of Warcraft\" subscriber base, was a leader of online gaming, noting that \"even Xbox Live is not even close to us\".\nCommunity content.\nA community of developers has arisen around Battle.net. Many unofficial clients are available for Battle.net, and most of the protocol used by Battle.net-enabled games has been reverse-engineered and published by volunteers.\nAlso, several communication tools have been made, like a \"whisper\" tool, so that a player could talk to their friends even if they are in a game.\nCustom games (using maps that were not made by Blizzard Entertainment) have helped build the community, and now are a substantial portion of the games played. Among the most popular of these games in \"\" are tower defense maps and \"hero solo\" maps (such as \"Defense of the Ancients\", and arena maps) or pure RTS games like \"Civilization Wars\", where the player develops their economy, tech, and unit diversity but the player has no control of their units.\nControversy.\nbnetd.\nA group of gamers reverse engineered the network protocol used by Battle.net and Blizzard games, and released a free (under the GNU GPL) Battle.net emulation package called bnetd. With bnetd, a gamer is not required to use the official Battle.net servers to play Blizzard games.\nIn February 2002, lawyers retained by Blizzard Entertainment threatened legal action under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) against the developers of bnetd. Blizzard games are designed to operate online exclusively with a set of Blizzard-controlled servers collectively known as \"Battle.net\". Battle.net servers include a CD key check as a means of preventing software piracy.\nDespite offers from the bnetd developers to integrate Blizzard's CD key checking system into bnetd, Blizzard claims that the public availability of any such software package facilitates piracy, and moved to have the bnetd project shut down under provisions of the DMCA. As this case is one of the first major test cases for the DMCA, the Electronic Frontier Foundation became involved. For a while negotiations were ongoing to resolve the case without a trial. However, the negotiations failed and Blizzard won the case on all counts: the defendants were ruled to have breached both StarCraft's End User License Agreement (EULA) and the Terms of Use of Battle.net.\nThis decision was appealed to the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals, which also ruled in favor of Blizzard Entertainment/Vivendi on September 1, 2005.\nPrivacy and Real ID.\nOn July 6, 2010, Blizzard Entertainment announced that they planned to change the way their forums worked to require that users identify themselves with their real name. The reaction from the community was overwhelmingly negative with multiple game magazines calling the change \"foolhardy\" and an \"Epic Fail\". It also resulted in the largest user response ever on the Blizzard forums. This included personal details of a Blizzard employee who gave his real name \"to show it wasn't a big deal\". Shortly after revealing his real name, personal information was posted that included his phone number, picture, age, home address, and other details.\nSome technology media outlets suggested the change was a good idea and would benefit both Battle.net and the Blizzard community. Others worried that Blizzard would open their fans up to real-life dangers such as stalking, sexual predators, and employment issues, since a simple Google search by a user's employer would reveal their online activities. There was also concern that this would lead to real-life harassment and safety concerns, especially for women and transgender gamers who are already harassed quite often in-game.\nBlizzard Entertainment initially responded to some of the concerns by saying that the changes would not be retroactive to previous posts, that parents could set up the system so that minors cannot post, and that posting to the forums is optional. However, due to the huge negative response, Blizzard President Michael Morhaime issued a statement rescinding the plan to use real names on Blizzard's forums for the time being.\n2012 hacking.\nDuring 2012, Blizzard Entertainment suffered a number of incidents related to security. In May 2012, shortly after \"Diablo III\"s launch, they discovered a number of accounts that had been hacked using traditional means through password knowledge, with affected game characters being stripped of in-game possessions that could be sold for money. Blizzard noted at this time that those accounts affected did not use their authentication option, and made changes to try to improve security, such as the above authentication requirement for the game's Auction House. A few months later on August 4, 2012, Blizzard reported that their Battle.net servers had been hacked into, with the perpetrators gaining access to some personal information, including user e-mail addresses, answers to security questions, and scrambled passwords, but not enough for user accounts to be compromised, according to Blizzard. Blizzard Entertainment required all players on Battle.net in North America to change their password and suggested all users change their security questions.\nThese security breaches led to a class-action lawsuit against Blizzard Entertainment in November 2012, claiming that the company was making a profit from the sale of Authenticator devices rather than using the money to enhance the security of their own servers, and that they failed to notify affected users about the August data breach in a timely manner. Most of the claims in the suit were summarily dismissed in favor of Blizzard Entertainment in July 2013, primarily as the plaintiffs could not show any harm they suffered from these breaches, and the remaining claims related to Battle.net Authenticator promotional claims were resolved through mediation. The case was ultimately closed in February 2014."}
{"title": "Hike_Messenger", "label": "Software", "text": "Hike Messenger, also called Hike Sticker Chat, was an Indian freeware, cross-platform instant messaging (IM), Voice over IP (VoIP) application which was launched on 12 December 2012 by Kavin Bharti Mittal and is now owned by Hike Private Limited. Hike can work offline through SMS and has multi-platform support. The app registration uses standard one time password (OTP) based authentication process. With abundance of low-cost data, Hike decided to go from a single super app strategy to multiple app approach, so that it can focus more on the core messaging capabilities. It has numerous Hikemoji Stickers which can be customized accordingly. From version 6, the user-interface was revised and the app no longer supports features like news, mobile payment, games or jokes. As per CB Insights, $1.4 billion is the valuation of Hike with more than 100 million registered users till August 2016 and 350 employees working from Bengaluru and Delhi.\nHistory.\nHike Messenger was launched globally on 12 December 2012 by founder Kavin Bharti Mittal, which over the next couple of months introduced features like free text messaging, themes, stickers, hidden chat option and a revamped user interface. The majority users are from India with 80 percent under the age group of 25. After buying US based free voice calling company Zip Phones in 2015, Hike started providing free voice calling over cellular network and WiFi across the globe before WhatsApp by optimizing voice quality while using low bandwidth which packs more minutes per megabyte (MB) of data. It also purchased startups like TinyMogul and Hoppr in the later part of 2015. After getting 30 percent sticker usage traffic, Hike launched the 'Great Indian Sticker Challenge' on 5 March 2015 to create more stickers.\nWith 90 percent of users under the age of 30, the beta testing of Hike messenger app was launched on 6 December 2015 for Windows Phone 8.1 and a Universal Windows Platform app (UWP) for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. Hike acquired InstaLively Livestreaming Pvt. Ltd in February 2017 which was behind the hyper local social networking app Pulse, that focused on instant audio and video digitization by using lower bandwidth speed which made it cost-effective for enterprises to create and broadcast content from any remote location.\nFrom version 5.0, it became the first social messaging app to start a mobile payment service in India. The timeline feature came back after multiple user requests and introduction of a personalized digital envelope called Blue Packets for sending monetary gifts through built-in wallet. In 2017, acquisition of Bengaluru based startup Creo was announced to enable third-party developers build services on top of Hike platform. From 2018, Hike decided to bring 1 billion users online by targeting tier-2 and tier-3 cities by giving more localized services.\nThe company decided to dump the previous super app approach as of January 2019 and is now looking at launching multiple specialized apps for specific users. In May 2019, Hike announced collaboration with Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, Delhi (IIIT-D) for developing artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), speech, link prediction, deep learning and computer vision. The company launched the first standalone app Hike Sticker Chat in April 2019, while a separate content app is now called Hike News &amp; Content. With the help of machine learning, Hike Sticker Chat can now recommend, suggest and smartly predicts custom stickers for different situations and mood.\nHike launched an animated sticker for Valentine's Day 2019 with a special pack for the LGBTQ community.\nDue to multilingual nature of Indian society, qwerty keyboards are difficult to localize so Hike is planning to use machine learning to make 80 to 90 percent of sticker-based chat a keyboard-less affair with the help of predictive analysis which now stands at 20 to 30 percent of user conversations on the platform. Hike stickers cover only 15 to 20 percent of vocabulary across 40 languages in India with future focus on text messages and symbols to achieve 100 percent prediction rate that gives a seamless experience while reducing keyboard dependency.\nAs of 2020. Hike was creating a smaller smart team of employees with game designers, crypto-economists and psychologists to understand the emerging digital landscape and create a new type of block-chain economy for its newly launched service called Hike Land.\nApplication.\nFeatures.\nFrom 15 April 2014, Hike is offering unlimited free SMS called Hike Offline through credits, earned by users from regular chatting for offline use to get a seamless experience as connectivity is still a major issue in many parts of India. To engage 80 percent of its audience who are under 25 years age group, Hike introduced features that find resonance with the local market such as Last Seen Privacy and localized sticker packs. It also introduced a two-way chat theme which was an industry-first innovation, allowing users to change the chat background for themselves and for their friends simultaneously. The app also started showing live Cricket scores in collaboration with Cricbuzz, news, casual games, social media feed, while one can do shopping, recharge and ticket booking with Hike Wallet. Hike brought large file transfer support which equipped users to share 100 MB files of all formats with discussion on further increasing the size limit to 1 GB.\nWith the launch of version 2.9.2.0 in January 2015, Hike implemented support for sending uncompressed images and a \"quick upload\" feature optimized for 2G speed. Later that month, Hike introduced a voice calling feature for its users. In September 2015, Hike launched free group calls support with up to 100 people in a simultaneous conference call environment. In November 2016, Hike announced the launch of a feature called Stories that allows people to share real-life moments using fun live filters which automatically get deleted after 48 hours, and a new camera design with localized filters. Hike 4.0 launched on 26 August 2015 with the tagline 'Got a Gang? Get on Hike'. The latest update makes the app five times faster, highly optimized for low-end phones and poor network conditions. It supports photo filters and doodles, bite-sized news updates in under a 100 characters. Hike launched News Feed with Hindi language support on 29 September 2015 to cater for the needs of the non-English population. Hike launched version 3.5 as the biggest update for Windows Phone 8.1 during December 2015 which changed the user interface for more simpler navigation, supported sending unlimited non-media files and documents of any format and better group admin settings. It also included ten brand-new chat themes.\nHike launched a microapp feature which was live for two days on 8 May 2016 as a Mother's Day special in which users can add images, quotes or messages as a token of love with customized e-cards and stickers on their timeline not only on Hike, but also on other platforms. On 26 October 2016, Hike Messenger rolled out the beta version of a video calling feature ahead of WhatsApp starting with the Android users which also lets recipients preview a video call before deciding to take it and is optimized to even work under 2G conditions. On 24 December 2016, Hike rolled out a short 20-second Video Stories feature that can be directly shared with friends or posted on a public timeline with different filters in collaboration with content creators with the same 48-hour time limit before being automatically deleted. The Stories feature continues to receive constant future updates to include and enable content, public story option, private user messaging and Geo-tagging.\nIn September 2017, Hike launched personalized sticker packs with 20,000+ graphical stickers for over 500 colleges that covered around 1,000 colleges by December 2018 across India which can be used across different geographies, and are highly customized for users with availability in 40+ local languages that support automatic sticker suggestions where the application suggests the best reply for any sticker message and also allows users to \"nudge\", a feature used to ping the receiver. Hike started supporting user comments on friend's posts, added a specific message reply function, a redesigned camera interface to support front flash and user mentions with the help of the @ symbol. In December 2017, Hike launched group voting, bill splitting, checklists and event reminders for group chat that supports up to 1,000 users both on iOS and Android platform. Hike launched another feature called Hike Land, which is a virtual world with beta trial to start from March 2020, that will use Hike Moji where online users with their digital avatar can hang out with other users and will be built inside the Hike Sticker Chat application. It is mainly targeted but not restricted towards 16 to 21 years age group of people. Without unveiling much about Hike Land, a separate website has been created with option to reserve spots by giving details like name, gender and phone number that will link the user profile from the Hike Sticker Chat account though it is not a necessity.\nHike Direct.\nThe Hike Direct feature is based on the technology known as WiFi Direct, which initially was also called WiFi P2P and got introduced to users by October 2015 which enables sharing of files such as music, apps, videos without a live internet connection within a 100-meter radius by creating a wireless network between two or more devices with a transfer speed of 100MB per minute. For privacy and security reasons, Hike doesn't show the recipient's location or proximity and works only when two users are connected in the same room by adding one another into the contact list.\nHike Wallet.\nIn June 2017, Hike announced the launch of version 5.0 with multiple new features like User Chat Themes, Night Mode and Magic Selfie. along with a built-in Wallet partnered with Yes Bank. This feature was first rolled out to Android users followed by iOS users at a later stage.\nHike collaborated with Airtel Payment Bank to power its digital payment wallet by November 2017 where Hike users have access to Airtel Payments Bank's merchant &amp; utility payment services and know your customer (KYC) infrastructure with 5 million transactions happening from services like recharge and P2P. Hike formed a partnership with Ola Cabs to bring a taxi and auto-rickshaw booking facility from 14 February 2018. Users can now also book bus tickets with 3,000 operators, pay for electricity, cooking gas, DTH and landline bills with 60 operators through Hike Wallet.\nSupport of Unified Payments Interface (UPI) based payments by Hike Wallet let users send and receive up to \u20b91 lakh directly into the bank account without sharing their credit/debit card or net banking credentials. Users can send money through UPI to anyone and not just Hike users. For non-UPI users, it allows transactions up to \u20b920,000 a month with a maximum cap per transaction at \u20b95,000.\nHike ID.\nIn January 2018, Hike announced the launch of 'Hike ID' to enhance its user privacy features. Hike ID is a unique custom username that removes the need for sharing phone numbers to chat with someone. Users can also search for each other using their Hike IDs. Hike ID has been integrated across all Hike-based services for facilitating easy discovery of people or groups.\nIn a survey done by the Hike team out of a million active users, 69 percent confirmed that they like to talk to others without sharing their own phone number and over 72 percent said that they like to skip the step of saving phone numbers before talking to others. This is what prompted the developers to come up with Hike ID as the solution which makes it easier as well as secure for users to chat without having to share or save phone numbers.\nHike Web.\nIn August 2019 it launched the Web App beta version of Hike Sticker Chat which enable its users to chat over their personal computers. The company also worked on a feature to allow sharing of stickers across all messaging platforms. Hike Web was created ensuring a seamless experience for users with a strong focus on privacy and security keeping that in mind Hike increased network security to AES-256 and TLS 1.2, which makes communication over a web client more secure than ever.\nHike Moji.\nHike Moji is a digital avatar of a user based on artificial intelligence (AI), natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) generated imagery created by taking a selfie, for variety of localized Indianised expressions with 1000 customized options like more than 350 hairstyles, 20 different facial features, bindis, local clothing style, nose pins with local twist and mood. The beta version 1.0 was rolled out on 15 November 2019 for both android and iOS. It was officially released to a wider audience base on 19 February 2020. With the stable release, it included 200 more customized options like 20 skin shades, over a million eyes colours, more than 400 accessories, dimples, freckles, cheek-lines and more. Hike Moji generate stickers are on three language where English and Hindi act as default with one other optional Indic language. Right now the language support is limited to Bengali, Gujarati, Kanada, Malayalam, Marathi, Tamil and Telugu. User can share 100+ exclusive Hike Moji stickers to other platforms. Computer vision and deep neural networks enable the platform to search around 100 trillion combinations of facial shape and color reflecting the user's looks within a few seconds. Life like images are generated with three seconds. Hike Moji version 1.0 (beta) alone created over 1 million plus stickers upon its launch in a control group of users. The stable version 1.0 can now create 100 quintillion combinations of stickers with seamless addition to WhatsApp. Inspired by local diversity of the country, HikeMoji now is the largest platform for hyper local avatar creation in India.\nPrivacy &amp; Security.\nAn article from 10 December 2012 published on German website Spiegel Online where app testers of MediaTest Digital found out while analyzing the data traffic of Hike version 1.0.5 for iOS that it transmits messages, phone numbers and unique device identification number (UDID) unencrypted and has full access to the phone address book. They called out that these deficiencies in Hike are even more undeniable than those made in the past in WhatsApp.\nHike uses a 128-bit Secure Sockets Layer encrypted firewall server for the exchange of media and text messages on Wi-Fi. In addition to a user choosing whom to share their last seen and profile pictures with, the app also supports an industry first hidden mode with a pattern lock feature for extended user privacy. As of June 2019, all chats and calls are now being protected by 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard and 2048 Rivest\u2013Shamir\u2013Adleman public-key cryptosystems and messages stored locally on a device are auto backed-up to its cloud server with zero data consumption. It is used for validating identity (signing) and ensuring that only the intended recipient can access the information sent (encryption). The data stored on hike servers is completely encrypted with an AES-128 algorithm with strong Key and Salt stored in a completely different key management system (KMS).\nPlatform Support.\nHike Total.\nIn January 2018, the company announced the launch of Total which is a customized version of Android that uses its own proprietary technology called UTTP, which is based on Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) protocol that is supported by nearly all GSM phones that allowed users to access services on their mobile even in the offline mode or without internet. Hike teamed up with mobile carriers and OEMs for Total, with device makers bundling a tweaked version of Android that makes Hike the default text/call app.\nThe total was targeted at the next billion mobile-first customers. Users can access essential services such as Messaging, News, Horoscope, Recharge, Wallet, Cricket Scores and Rail information even without an active internet connection with services taking less than 100 kb to 1 MB of size. Users can also buy data packs which are as low as \u20b91 from within the operating system.\nHike announced Intex Technologies, Karbonn Mobiles as device partners and BSNL, Aircel as telecom service providers. Hike announced the availability of the Total platform for 'Mera Pehla Smartphone' initiative launched by Airtel India. The first batch of handsets supporting the technology were released by March 2018. It wasn't available for download on Google Play as it is exclusive to handset models produced by partner original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).\nUser statistics.\nHike acquired its first five million users within three months after the app launch which increased to fifteen million by September 2013. Up to May 2014, the user base increased to twenty million with additional fifteen million joining till August 2014. Hike reached seventy million users till October 2015 by adding an additional thirty million within three months from August 2015. Twenty billion messages were shared regularly every month till August 2015, that grew to over one billion messages shared every single day by December 2015, that again doubled to forty billion monthly messages till January 2016 as users are spending over 120 minutes per week on the app.\nOn average, users are spending more than 120 minutes per week on the app as they are viewing 11.2 news stories on average per user per day while transferring close to 10 million files with Hike Direct which is more than 200 terabytes of data without the use of actual internet. As of January 2019, 29 percent of internet users in India use Hike as a messenger or VoIP platform.\nHike crossed over its first hundred million registered users in January 2016 as per founder and company CEO, Kavin Bharti Mittal which added a further sixty million till May 2019. Over ten million mobile transactions were done on Hike as of November 2017 of which 70 percent were for various recharges, while 30 percent were peer to peer transaction (P2P). A further breakdown of 30 percent P2P transactions consists of 10 percent UPI payments, 10 percent Blue Packets which are virtual envelopes that users can insert money into and send to friends with personal messages, filters and 10 percent normal wallet transactions. During this time around Hike also recorded a 30 percent month after month rise in its active user base. Hike Messenger announced that it crossed five million monthly transactions within five months of Hike Wallet's launch at a 30 percent month after month growth which by December 2017 increased to ten million monthly transactions at a 100 percent month after month growth rate.\nAround 50,000 users are joining Hike Sticker Chat per day which the company wants to quadruple by the end of 2019. The initial target is capturing of 15 to 20 percent youth population in India and a wider base from tier-1 and tier-2 cities since maximum growth is coming from Pune, Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Jaipur. As of December 2019, the app has over two million weekly active users.\nFunding.\nHike raised its first round of funding of $7 million from Bharti Enterprises and SoftBank Group in April 2013. It again received a second round of investment of $14 million from Bharti Enterprises and Softbank Group in March 2014 to scale up operations when it crossed 15 million subscribers. In August 2014, Hike reached 35 million users and raised $65 million in a funding round led by Tiger Global. It raised $175 million in a Series D round of funding led by Tencent and Foxconn on 16 August 2016. After raising this round Hike reached the valuation of $1.4 billion and became the youngest startup in India to reach unicorn status, having achieved it in just 3.7 years after launch.\nControversy.\nAround January 2016, Hike spokesperson told Press Trust of India journalist that Facebook blocked an option in its advertisements which allows people to visit the Hike official website which they assumed to be an initial technical glitch, but later Facebook confirmed that certain products and services can't be advertised on its platform which stopped the Hike ads. Facebook has not publicly responded to Hike's allegations whereas it's worth noting that Facebook-owned WhatsApp is the rival service to the Hike messaging app in the Indian market.\nApril Fools' pranks.\nOn April 1, 2014, the app pranked its users with \"HikeCoin\", which was modeled after Bitcoin for direct cash transfers by announcing that a photo of real monetary note, attached and sent to friends would make the physical note invalid.\nOn March 31, 2016 Hike announced \"Hike Smell\", a fictional feature added as a prank on April Fools' Day. Users were informed that by using special sensors in their smartphones, they could capture and attach smells to their messages.\nShutdown.\nOn 6 January 2021 company announced end of messaging services effective 14 January 2021 12:00 PM IST by sending following text to its users:\n\"Today we're announcing that after so many years of helping you deepen friendships, we will be shutting down Hike Sticker Chat at 11.59pm on 14th Jan, 2021.\"\n\"We thank you for creating amazing memories with us on Hike Sticker Chat and giving us your love and trust for so many years\"\n\"We wouldn\u2019t be here without each and every one of you.\"\nHike also announced that all the Hike Stickers can still be used on other messaging platforms like Signal , Whatsapp , Telegram by Downloading 'Stickers by Hike'."}
{"title": "4G", "label": "Software", "text": "4G is the fourth generation of broadband cellular network technology, succeeding 3G, and preceding 5G. A 4G system must provide capabilities defined by ITU in IMT Advanced. Potential and current applications include amended mobile web access, IP telephony, gaming services, high-definition mobile TV, video conferencing, and 3D television.\nThe first-release WIMAX standard was commercially deployed in South Korea in 2006 and has since been deployed in most parts of the world.\nThe first-release Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard was commercially deployed in Oslo, Norway, and Stockholm, Sweden in 2009, and has since been deployed throughout most parts of the world. It has, however, been debated whether first-release versions should be considered 4G LTE. The 4G wireless cellular standard was defined by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and specifies the key characteristics of the standard, including transmission technology and data speeds.\nEach generation of wireless cellular technology has introduced increased bandwidth speeds and network capacity. 4G users get speeds of up to 100 Mbps, while 3G only promised a peak speed of 14 Mbps.\nTechnical overview.\nIn November 2008, the International Telecommunications Union-Radio communications sector (ITU-R) specified a set of requirements for 4G standards, named the International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced (IMT-Advanced) specification, setting peak speed requirements for 4G service at 100 megabits per second (Mbit/s)(=12.5 megabytes per second) for high mobility communication (such as from trains and cars) and 1 gigabit per second (Gbit/s) for low mobility communication (such as pedestrians and stationary users).\nSince the first-release versions of Mobile WiMAX and LTE support much less than 1 Gbit/s peak bit rate, they are not fully IMT-Advanced compliant, but are often branded 4G by service providers. According to operators, a generation of the network refers to the deployment of a new non-backward-compatible technology. On December 6, 2010, ITU-R recognized that these two technologies, as well as other beyond-3G technologies that do not fulfill the IMT-Advanced requirements, could nevertheless be considered \"4G\", provided they represent forerunners to IMT-Advanced compliant versions and \"a substantial level of improvement in performance and capabilities with respect to the initial third generation systems now deployed\".\nMobile WiMAX Release 2 (also known as \"WirelessMAN-Advanced\" or \"IEEE 802.16m\") and LTE Advanced\n(LTE-A) are IMT-Advanced compliant backwards compatible versions of the above two systems, standardized during the spring 2011, and promising speeds in the order of 1 Gbit/s. Services were expected in 2013.\nAs opposed to earlier generations, a 4G system does not support traditional circuit-switched telephony service, but instead relies on all-Internet Protocol (IP) based communication such as IP telephony. As seen below, the spread spectrum radio technology used in 3G systems is abandoned in all 4G candidate systems and replaced by OFDMA multi-carrier transmission and other frequency-domain equalization (FDE) schemes, making it possible to transfer very high bit rates despite extensive multi-path radio propagation (echoes). The peak bit rate is further improved by smart antenna arrays for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications.\nBackground.\nIn the field of mobile communications, a \"generation\" generally refers to a change in the fundamental nature of the service, non-backwards-compatible transmission technology, higher peak bit rates, new frequency bands, wider channel frequency bandwidth in Hertz, and higher capacity for many simultaneous data transfers (higher system spectral efficiency in bit/second/Hertz/site).\nNew mobile generations have appeared about every ten years since the first move from 1981 analog (1G) to digital (2G) transmission in 1992. This was followed, in 2001, by 3G multi-media support, spread spectrum transmission and a minimum peak bit rate of 200 kbit/s, in 2011/2012 to be followed by \"real\" 4G, which refers to all-Internet Protocol (IP) packet-switched networks giving mobile ultra-broadband (gigabit speed) access.\nWhile the ITU has adopted recommendations for technologies that would be used for future global communications, they do not actually perform the standardization or development work themselves, instead relying on the work of other standard bodies such as IEEE, WiMAX Forum, and 3GPP.\nIn the mid-1990s, the ITU-R standardization organization released the IMT-2000 requirements as a framework for what standards should be considered 3G systems, requiring 200 kbit/s peak bit rate. In 2008, ITU-R specified the IMT Advanced (International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced) requirements for 4G systems.\nThe fastest 3G-based standard in the UMTS family is the HSPA+ standard, which is commercially available since 2009 and offers 28\u00a0Mbit/s downstream (22\u00a0Mbit/s upstream) without MIMO, i.e. with only one antenna, and in 2011 accelerated up to 42\u00a0Mbit/s peak bit rate downstream using either DC-HSPA+ (simultaneous use of two 5\u00a0MHz UMTS carriers) or\n2x2 MIMO. In theory speeds up to 672\u00a0Mbit/s are possible, but have not been deployed yet. The fastest 3G-based standard in the CDMA2000 family is the EV-DO Rev. B, which is available since 2010 and offers 15.67\u00a0Mbit/s downstream.\nFrequencies for 4G LTE networks.\n\"See here: LTE frequency bands\"\nIMT-Advanced requirements.\nThis article refers to 4G using IMT-Advanced (\"International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced\"), as defined by ITU-R. An IMT-Advanced cellular system must fulfill the following requirements:\nIn September 2009, the technology proposals were submitted to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) as 4G candidates. Basically all proposals are based on two technologies:\nImplementations of Mobile WiMAX and first-release LTE were largely considered a stopgap solution that would offer a considerable boost until WiMAX 2 (based on the 802.16m specification) and LTE Advanced was deployed. The latter's standard versions were ratified in spring 2011.\nThe first set of 3GPP requirements on LTE Advanced was approved in June 2008. LTE Advanced was standardized in 2010 as part of Release 10 of the 3GPP specification.\nSome sources consider first-release LTE and Mobile WiMAX implementations as pre-4G or near-4G, as they do not fully comply with the planned requirements of 1Gbit/s for stationary reception and 100Mbit/s for mobile.\nConfusion has been caused by some mobile carriers who have launched products advertised as 4G but which according to some sources are pre-4G versions, commonly referred to as 3.9G, which do not follow the ITU-R defined principles for 4G standards, but today can be called 4G according to ITU-R. Vodafone Netherlands for example, advertised LTE as 4G, while advertising LTE Advanced as their '4G+' service. A common argument for branding 3.9G systems as new-generation is that they use different frequency bands from 3G technologies; that they are based on a new radio-interface paradigm; and that the standards are not backwards compatible with 3G, whilst some of the standards are forwards compatible with IMT-2000 compliant versions of the same standards.\nSystem standards.\nIMT-2000 compliant 4G standards.\nAs of October 2010, ITU-R Working Party 5D approved two industry-developed technologies (LTE Advanced and WirelessMAN-Advanced) for inclusion in the ITU's International Mobile Telecommunications Advanced program (IMT-Advanced program), which is focused on global communication systems that will be available several years from now.\nLTE Advanced.\nLTE Advanced (Long Term Evolution Advanced) is a candidate for IMT-Advanced standard, formally submitted by the 3GPP organization to ITU-T in the fall 2009, and expected to be released in 2013. The target of 3GPP LTE Advanced is to reach and surpass the ITU requirements. LTE Advanced is essentially an enhancement to LTE. It is not a new technology, but rather an improvement on the existing LTE network. This upgrade path makes it more cost effective for vendors to offer LTE and then upgrade to LTE Advanced which is similar to the upgrade from WCDMA to HSPA. LTE and LTE Advanced will also make use of additional spectrums and multiplexing to allow it to achieve higher data speeds. Coordinated Multi-point Transmission will also allow more system capacity to help handle the enhanced data speeds.\nIEEE 802.16m or WirelessMAN-Advanced.\nThe IEEE 802.16m or WirelessMAN-Advanced (WiMAX 2) evolution of 802.16e is under development, with the objective to fulfill the IMT-Advanced criteria of 1 Gbit/s for stationary reception and 100\u00a0Mbit/s for mobile reception.\nForerunner versions.\n3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE).\nThe pre-4G 3GPP Long Term Evolution (LTE) technology is often branded \"4G \u2013 LTE\", but the first LTE release does not fully comply with the IMT-Advanced requirements. LTE has a theoretical net bit rate capacity of up to 100\u00a0Mbit/s in the downlink and 50\u00a0Mbit/s in the uplink if a 20\u00a0MHz channel is used \u2014 and more if multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), i.e. antenna arrays, are used.\nThe physical radio interface was at an early stage named \"High Speed OFDM Packet Access\" (HSOPA), now named Evolved UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access (E-UTRA).\nThe first LTE USB dongles do not support any other radio interface.\nThe world's first publicly available LTE service was opened in the two Scandinavian capitals, Stockholm (Ericsson and Nokia Siemens Networks systems) and Oslo (a Huawei system) on December 14, 2009, and branded 4G. The user terminals were manufactured by Samsung. As of November 2012, the five publicly available LTE services in the United States are provided by MetroPCS, Verizon Wireless, AT&amp;T Mobility, U.S. Cellular, Sprint, and T-Mobile US.\nT-Mobile Hungary launched a public beta test (called \"friendly user test\") on 7 October 2011, and has offered commercial 4G LTE services since 1 January 2012.\nIn South Korea, SK Telecom and LG U+ have enabled access to LTE service since 1 July 2011 for data devices, slated to go nationwide by 2012. KT Telecom closed its 2G service by March 2012 and completed nationwide LTE service in the same frequency around 1.8\u00a0GHz by June 2012.\nIn the United Kingdom, LTE services were launched by EE in October 2012, by O2 and Vodafone in August 2013, and by Three in December 2013.\nMobile WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e).\nThe Mobile WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e-2005) mobile wireless broadband access (MWBA) standard (also known as WiBro in South Korea) is sometimes branded 4G, and offers peak data rates of 128\u00a0Mbit/s downlink and 56\u00a0Mbit/s uplink over 20\u00a0MHz wide channels. \nIn June 2006, the world's first commercial mobile WiMAX service was opened by KT in Seoul, South Korea.\nSprint has begun using Mobile WiMAX, as of 29 September 2008, branding it as a \"4G\" network even though the current version does not fulfill the IMT Advanced requirements on 4G systems.\nIn Russia, Belarus and Nicaragua WiMax broadband internet access were offered by a Russian company Scartel, and was also branded 4G, Yota.\nIn the latest version of the standard, WiMax 2.1, the standard has been updated to be not compatible with earlier WiMax standard, and is instead interchangeable with LTE-TDD system, effectively merging WiMax standard with LTE.\nTD-LTE for China market.\nJust as Long-Term Evolution (LTE) and WiMAX are being vigorously promoted in the global telecommunications industry, the former (LTE) is also the most powerful 4G mobile communications leading technology and has quickly occupied the Chinese market. TD-LTE, one of the two variants of the LTE air interface technologies, is not yet mature, but many domestic and international wireless carriers are, one after the other turning to TD-LTE.\nIBM's data shows that 67% of the operators are considering LTE because this is the main source of their future market. The above news also confirms IBM's statement that while only 8% of the operators are considering the use of WiMAX, WiMAX can provide the fastest network transmission to its customers on the market and could challenge LTE.\nTD-LTE is not the first 4G wireless mobile broadband network data standard, but it is China's 4G standard that was amended and published by China's largest telecom operator \u2013 China Mobile. After a series of field trials, is expected to be released into the commercial phase in the next two years. Ulf Ewaldsson, Ericsson's vice president said: \"the Chinese Ministry of Industry and China Mobile in the fourth quarter of this year will hold a large-scale field test, by then, Ericsson will help the hand.\" But viewing from the current development trend, whether this standard advocated by China Mobile will be widely recognized by the international market is still debatable.\nDiscontinued candidate systems.\nUMB (formerly EV-DO Rev. C).\nUMB (Ultra Mobile Broadband) was the brand name for a discontinued 4G project within the 3GPP2 standardization group to improve the CDMA2000 mobile phone standard for next generation applications and requirements. In November 2008, Qualcomm, UMB's lead sponsor, announced it was ending development of the technology, favoring LTE instead. The objective was to achieve data speeds over 275\u00a0Mbit/s downstream and over 75\u00a0Mbit/s upstream.\nFlash-OFDM.\nAt an early stage the Flash-OFDM system was expected to be further developed into a 4G standard.\niBurst and MBWA (IEEE 802.20) systems.\nThe iBurst system (or HC-SDMA, High Capacity Spatial Division Multiple Access) was at an early stage considered to be a 4G predecessor. It was later further developed into the Mobile Broadband Wireless Access (MBWA) system, also known as IEEE 802.20.\nPrincipal technologies in all candidate systems.\nKey features.\nThe following key features can be observed in all suggested 4G technologies:\nAs opposed to earlier generations, 4G systems do not support circuit switched telephony. IEEE 802.20, UMB and OFDM standards lack soft-handover support, also known as cooperative relaying.\nMultiplexing and access schemes.\nRecently, new access schemes like Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA), Single Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA), Interleaved FDMA, and Multi-carrier CDMA (MC-CDMA) are gaining more importance for the next generation systems. These are based on efficient FFT algorithms and frequency domain equalization, resulting in a lower number of multiplications per second. They also make it possible to control the bandwidth and form the spectrum in a flexible way. However, they require advanced dynamic channel allocation and adaptive traffic scheduling.\nWiMax is using OFDMA in the downlink and in the uplink. For the LTE (telecommunication), OFDMA is used for the downlink; by contrast, Single-carrier FDMA is used for the uplink since OFDMA contributes more to the PAPR related issues and results in nonlinear operation of amplifiers. IFDMA provides less power fluctuation and thus requires energy-inefficient linear amplifiers. Similarly, MC-CDMA is in the proposal for the IEEE 802.20 standard. These access schemes offer the same efficiencies as older technologies like CDMA. Apart from this, scalability and higher data rates can be achieved.\nThe other important advantage of the above-mentioned access techniques is that they require less complexity for equalization at the receiver. This is an added advantage especially in the MIMO environments since the spatial multiplexing transmission of MIMO systems inherently require high complexity equalization at the receiver.\nIn addition to improvements in these multiplexing systems, improved modulation techniques are being used. Whereas earlier standards largely used Phase-shift keying, more efficient systems such as 64QAM are being proposed for use with the 3GPP Long Term Evolution standards.\nIPv6 support.\nUnlike 3G, which is based on two parallel infrastructures consisting of circuit switched and packet switched network nodes, 4G is based on packet switching \"only\". This requires low-latency data transmission.\nAs IPv4 addresses are (nearly) exhausted, IPv6 is essential to support the large number of wireless-enabled devices that communicate using IP. By increasing the number of IP addresses available, IPv6 removes the need for network address translation (NAT), a method of sharing a limited number of addresses among a larger group of devices, which has a number of problems and limitations. When using IPv6, some kind of NAT is still required for communication with legacy IPv4 devices that are not also IPv6-connected.\n, Verizon has posted Specifications that require any 4G devices on its network to support IPv6.\nAdvanced antenna systems.\nThe performance of radio communications depends on an antenna system, termed smart or intelligent antenna. Recently, multiple antenna technologies are emerging to achieve the goal of 4G systems such as high rate, high reliability, and long range communications. In the early 1990s, to cater for the growing data rate needs of data communication, many transmission schemes were proposed. One technology, spatial multiplexing, gained importance for its bandwidth conservation and power efficiency. Spatial multiplexing involves deploying multiple antennas at the transmitter and at the receiver. Independent streams can then be transmitted simultaneously from all the antennas. This technology, called MIMO (as a branch of intelligent antenna), multiplies the base data rate by (the smaller of) the number of transmit antennas or the number of receive antennas. Apart from this, the reliability in transmitting high speed data in the fading channel can be improved by using more antennas at the transmitter or at the receiver. This is called \"transmit\" or \"receive diversity\". Both transmit/receive diversity and transmit spatial multiplexing are categorized into the space-time coding techniques, which does not necessarily require the channel knowledge at the transmitter. The other category is closed-loop multiple antenna technologies, which require channel knowledge at the transmitter.\nOpen-wireless Architecture and Software-defined radio (SDR).\nOne of the key technologies for 4G and beyond is called Open Wireless Architecture (OWA), supporting multiple wireless air interfaces in an open architecture platform.\nSDR is one form of open wireless architecture (OWA). Since 4G is a collection of wireless standards, the final form of a 4G device will constitute various standards. This can be efficiently realized using SDR technology, which is categorized to the area of the radio convergence.\nHistory of 4G and pre-4G technologies.\nThe 4G system was originally envisioned by the DARPA, the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. DARPA selected the distributed architecture and end-to-end Internet protocol (IP), and believed at an early stage in peer-to-peer networking in which every mobile device would be both a transceiver and a router for other devices in the network, eliminating the spoke-and-hub weakness of 2G and 3G cellular systems. Since the 2.5G GPRS system, cellular systems have provided dual infrastructures: packet switched nodes for data services, and circuit switched nodes for voice calls. In 4G systems, the circuit-switched infrastructure is abandoned and only a packet-switched network is provided, while 2.5G and 3G systems require both packet-switched and circuit-switched network nodes, i.e. two infrastructures in parallel. This means that in 4G traditional voice calls are replaced by IP telephony.\nSince 2009, the LTE-Standard has strongly evolved over the years, resulting in many deployments by various operators across the globe. For an overview of commercial LTE networks and their respective historic development see: List of LTE networks. Among the vast range of deployments, many operators are considering the deployment and operation of LTE networks. A compilation of planned LTE deployments can be found at: List of planned LTE networks.\nDisadvantages.\n4G introduces a potential inconvenience for those who travel internationally or wish to switch carriers. In order to make and receive 4G voice calls, the subscriber handset must not only have a matching frequency band (and in some cases require unlocking), it must also have the matching enablement settings for the local carrier and/or country. While a phone purchased from a given carrier can be expected to work with that carrier, making 4G voice calls on another carrier's network (including international roaming) may be impossible without a software update specific to the local carrier and the phone model in question, which may or may not be available (although fallback to 3G for voice calling may still be possible if a 3G network is available with a matching frequency band).\nBeyond 4G research.\nA major issue in 4G systems is to make the high bit rates available in a larger portion of the cell, especially to users in an exposed position in between several base stations. In current research, this issue is addressed by macro-diversity techniques, also known as group cooperative relay, and also by Beam-Division Multiple Access (BDMA).\nPervasive networks are an amorphous and at present entirely hypothetical concept where the user can be simultaneously connected to several wireless access technologies and can seamlessly move between them (See vertical handoff, IEEE 802.21). These access technologies can be Wi-Fi, UMTS, EDGE, or any other future access technology. Included in this concept is also smart-radio (also known as cognitive radio) technology to efficiently manage spectrum use and transmission power as well as the use of mesh routing protocols to create a pervasive network."}
{"title": "Dropbox", "label": "Software", "text": "Dropbox is a file hosting service operated by the American company Dropbox, Inc., headquartered in San Francisco, California, US that offers cloud storage, file synchronization, personal cloud, and client software. Dropbox was founded in 2007 by MIT students Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi as a startup company, with initial funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator.\nDropbox has been ranked as one of the most valuable startups in the US and the world, with a valuation of over US$10\u00a0billion, and it has been described as one of Y Combinator's most successful investments to date. However, Dropbox has also experienced criticism and generated controversy for issues including security breaches and privacy concerns.\nDropbox has been blocked in China since 2014. It received a five star rating in the Electronic Frontier Foundation's 2017 \"Protecting Your Data From Government Requests\" report.\nConcept.\nDropbox brings files together in one central place by creating a special folder on the user's computer. The contents of these folders are synchronized to Dropbox's servers and to other computers and devices where the user has installed Dropbox, keeping the same files up-to-date on all devices. Dropbox uses a freemium business model, where users are offered a free account with a set storage size, with paid subscriptions available that offer more capacity and additional features. Dropbox Basic users are given two gigabytes of free storage space. Dropbox Plus users are given two terabytes of storage space, as well as additional features, including advanced sharing controls, remote wipe, and an optional Extended Version History add-on. Dropbox offers computer apps for Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux computers, and mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone smartphones and tablets. In March 2013, the company acquired Mailbox, a popular email app, and in April 2014, the company introduced Dropbox Carousel, a photo and video gallery app. Both Mailbox and Carousel were shut down in December 2015, with key features from both apps implemented into the regular Dropbox service. In October 2015, it officially announced Dropbox Paper, its collaborative document editor, in a reported effort to expand its operations towards businesses. In March 2016, Dropbox had 500 million users.\nHistory.\nDropbox founder Drew Houston conceived the Dropbox concept after repeatedly forgetting his USB flash drive while he was a student at MIT. In a 2009 \"Meet the Team\" post on the Dropbox blog, he wrote that existing services at the time \"suffered problems with Internet latency, large files, bugs, or just made me think too much\". He began making something for his personal use, but then realized that it could benefit others with the same problems.\nHouston founded Evenflow, Inc. in May 2007 as the company behind Dropbox, and shortly thereafter secured seed funding from Y Combinator. Dropbox was officially launched at 2008's TechCrunch Disrupt, an annual technology conference. Owing to trademark disputes between Proxy, Inc. and Evenflow, Dropbox's official domain name was \"\"get\"dropbox.com\" until October 2009, when it acquired its current domain, \"dropbox.com\". In October 2009, Evenflow, Inc. was renamed to Dropbox, Inc.\nIn an interview with \"TechCrunch\"s \"Founder Stories\" in October 2011, Houston explained that a demo video was released during Dropbox's early days, with one viewer being Arash Ferdowsi. Ferdowsi was \"so impressed\" that they formed a partnership. In regards to competition, Houston stated that \"It is easy for me to explain the idea, it is actually really hard to do it.\"\nUser growth.\nDropbox saw steady user growth after its inception. It surpassed the 1 million registered users milestone in April 2009, followed by 2 million in September, and 3 million in November. It passed 50 million users in October 2011, 100 million in November 2012, 200 million in November 2013, 400 million in June 2015, and 500 million in March 2016.\nAcquisitions.\nIn July 2012, Dropbox acquired TapEngage, a startup that \"enables advertisers and publishers to collaborate on tablet-optimized advertising\". The following December, Dropbox acquired two companies; Audiogalaxy, a startup \"allowing users to store their music files and playlists in the cloud then stream them to any device\", and Snapjoy, a company that allowed users to \"aggregate, archive and view all of their digital photos from their cameras, phones and popular apps like Flickr, Instagram and Picasa, and then view them online or via an iOS app\". In July 2013, Dropbox acquired Endorse, a \"mobile coupon startup\".\nIn May 2014, Dropbox acquired Bubbli, a startup that has \"built some innovative ways of incorporating 3D technology into 2D views, and packaging it in a mobile app\".\nIn January 2015, Dropbox acquired CloudOn, a company that provided mobile applications for document editing and creation. At the same time, Dropbox told \"TechCrunch\" that CloudOn's base in Herzliya would become the first Dropbox office in Israel. In July, Dropbox acquired Clementine, an enterprise communication service.\nIn April 2014, Dropbox acquired photo-sharing company Loom (which would be shut down and integrated with the then-recently announced Carousel), and document-sharing startup Hackpad. Dropbox later announced in April 2017 that Hackpad would be shut down on July 19, with all notes being migrated to Dropbox Paper.\nIn January 2019, Dropbox acquired e-signature company HelloSign. The acquisition was reported to be Dropbox's largest to date, at a reported $230 million.\nIn March 2021, Dropbox announced the acquisition of DocSend. DocSend offers a secure document sharing and analytics product.\n2021 workforce reduction.\nIn January 2021, Dropbox CEO Houston announced the layoff of 315 employees, which is approximately 11 percent of the current workforce. The company said the reductions were necessary in order to focus the company team structure and focus on top level priorities. The software firm also announced that COO Olivia Nottebohm would be leaving the company on February 5, 2021.\nDropbox explained in October 2020 its decision to make telecommuting the default experience for individual tasks and the creation of Dropbox Studios to enable team collaboration and personal encounters.\nPlatforms.\nDropbox has computer apps for Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, and Linux computers, and mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows Phone smartphones and tablets. It also offers a website interface. As part of its partnership with Microsoft, Dropbox announced a universal Windows 10 app in January 2016.\nDropbox's apps offer an automatic photo uploading feature, allowing users to automatically upload photos or videos from cameras, tablets, SD cards, or smartphones to a dedicated \"Camera Uploads\" folder in their Dropbox. Users are given 500\u00a0megabytes of extra space for uploading their first photo, and are given up to 3\u00a0gigabytes of extra space if users continue using the method for more photos.\nIn July 2014, Dropbox introduced \"streaming sync\" for its computer apps. Streaming sync was described as a new \"supercharged\" synchronization speed for large files that improves the upload or download time by up to 2 times.\nIn August 2015, Dropbox announced the availability of \"Universal 2nd Factor\" USB security keys, providing two-factor authentication for logging into its services.\nSystem requirements for the Dropbox app.\nLinux.\nThe Dropbox app for Linux requires:\niPhone and iPad.\nThe Dropbox app for iPhone and iPad requires:\nMac.\nThe Dropbox app for Mac requires:\nAndroid.\nThe Dropbox app for Android requires:\nFinancials.\nDropbox received initial funding from seed accelerator Y Combinator.&gt; Dropbox also raised US$1.2 million in Series A funding from Sequoia Capital in 2007, that \"along with interest (on that amount) converted to equity as part of the Series A investment, which included a fresh slug of US$6 million\", bringing the total amount to US$7.25 million, with the round closed in 2008 and documents filed in 2009.\nA May 2010 report in \"The Wall Street Journal\" said that \"since [founder Drew Houston] started reading Eric Ries' Lean startup blog about a year ago, the company has started trickling out new features when they are ready instead of waiting to launch a fully featured product. That helps test customer appetite, he says, dubbing the practice \"minimum viable product\".\n\"TechCrunch\" reported in July 2011 that Dropbox had been looking to raise between US$200 and US$300 million, and had a valuation \"to end up in the $5 billion to $10 billion range. [...] quite a step up from its previous funding rounds which have totalled a tiny $7.2 million\". As noted in a \"Forbes\" article, Dropbox had \"revenue on track to hit $240 million in 2011\".\nIn April 2012, Dropbox announced that Bono and The Edge, two members of the Irish rock band U2, were individual investors in the company.\nIn 2014 Dropbox raised financing from BlackRock Inc. and others that values the company at $10 billion.\nIn March 2017, \"Bloomberg\" reported that Dropbox had secured a US$600\u00a0million credit line, with the company expected to file for its initial public offering (IPO) \"as soon as this year\".\nIn February 2018, Dropbox filed an IPO to be listed on the Nasdaq. The company's initial intent was to raise $500 million. Dropbox's stock rose 42 percent to $29.89 in its first day of trading on March 23, 2018.\nAs of February 2021, Dropbox has been profitable in the last three quarters, whilst also having no debt.\nBusiness model.\nDropbox uses a freemium business model, where users are offered a free account with a set storage size, with paid subscriptions available that offer more capacity and additional features. Accordingly, Dropbox's revenue is a product of how many users they can convert to their paid services.\nDropbox Basic users are given two gigabytes of free storage space. This can be expanded through referrals; users recommend the service to other people, and if those people start using the service, the user is awarded with additional 500\u00a0megabytes of storage space. Dropbox Basic users can earn up to 16\u00a0gigabytes through the referral program.\nThe Dropbox Plus subscription (named Dropbox Pro prior to March 2017) gives users 2\u00a0terabytes of storage space, as well as additional features, including:\nIn November 2013, Dropbox announced changes to \"Dropbox for Business\" that would enable users to connect both their personal Dropbox and their business Dropbox to the same device, with each of the folders being \"properly labeled for personal or work, and come with its own password, contacts, settings, and files\". Furthermore, Dropbox announced shared audit logs, remote wipe for business administrators, and account transfers, as new features of its Business offering. In January 2017, Dropbox introduced \"Smart Sync\" for Business and Enterprise customers, a feature that lets Windows and macOS users see all files in the Dropbox folder, but only download specific files on-demand.\nSimilarly to Dropbox Basic, Dropbox Plus users can also earn extra space through referrals. Plus users earn 1\u00a0gigabyte per referral, up to 32\u00a0gigabytes.\nDropbox Business is Dropbox's application for corporations, adding more business-centered functionality for teams, including collaboration tools, advanced security and control, unlimited file recovery, user management and granular permissions, and options for unlimited storage. For large organizations, Dropbox offers Dropbox Enterprise, the \"highest tier\" of its product offerings, adding domain management tools, an assigned Dropbox customer support member, and help from \"expert advisors\" on deployment and user training.\nIn July 2016, Dropbox announced a new \"AdminX\" administrator dashboard for Business customers, offering improved control of company files and users. In June 2017, the AdminX dashboard was given a redesign and additional administrator functions, such as log-in durations, custom password strength parameters, and more granular subdomain verifications for specified teams.\nCompany partnerships.\nIn September 2012, Facebook and Dropbox integrated to allow users in Facebook Groups to share files using Dropbox. In 2013, Samsung pre-loaded the Dropbox mobile application on its Android devices and Dropbox provided extra space for users owning Samsung's devices. In November 2014, Dropbox announced a partnership with Microsoft to integrate Dropbox and Microsoft Office applications on iOS, Android and the applications on the web.\nOn July 10, 2018, Dropbox announced its partnership with Salesforce aiming to improve brand engagement and team productivity.\nTechnology.\nThe Dropbox software enables users to drop any file into a designated folder. The file is then automatically uploaded to Dropbox's cloud-based service and made available to any other of the user's computers and devices that also have the Dropbox software installed, keeping the file up-to-date on all systems. When a file in a user's Dropbox folder is changed, Dropbox only uploads the pieces of the file that have been changed, whenever possible.\nWhen a file or folder is deleted, users can recover it within 30 days. For Dropbox Plus users, this recovery time can be extended to one year, by purchasing an \"Extended Version History\" add-on.\nDropbox accounts that are not accessed or emails not replied in a year are automatically deleted.\nDropbox also offers a LAN sync feature, where, instead of receiving information and data from the Dropbox servers, computers on the local network can exchange files directly between each other, potentially significantly improving synchronization speeds. LAN Sync discovers other peers on the same network via UDP port 17500 using a proprietary discovery protocol developed by early Dropbox engineer Paul Bohm in 2010.\nOriginally, the Dropbox servers and computer apps were written in Python. In July 2014, Dropbox began migrating its performance-critical backend infrastructure to Go.\nIn September 2012, Dropbox's website code base was rewritten from JavaScript to CoffeeScript.\nDropbox originally used Amazon's S3 storage system to store user files, but between 2014 and 2016 they gradually moved away from Amazon to use their own hardware, referred to as \"Magic Pocket\", due to Dropbox's description as \"a place where you keep all your stuff, it doesn\u2019t get lost, and you can always access it\". In June 2017, the company announced a major global network expansion, aiming to increase synchronization speeds while cutting costs. The expansion, starting with 14 cities across 7 countries on 3 continents, adds \"hundreds of gigabits of Internet connectivity with transit providers (regional and global ISPs), and hundreds of new peering partners (where we exchange traffic directly rather than through an ISP)\".\nDropbox uses SSL transfers for synchronization and stores the data via Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)-256 encryption.\nThe functionality of Dropbox can be integrated into third-party applications through an application programming interface (API).\nDropbox prevents sharing of copyrighted data, by checking the hash of files shared in public folders or between users against a blacklist of copyrighted material. This only applies to files or folders shared with other users or publicly, and not to files kept in an individual's Dropbox folder that are not shared.\nMailbox.\nIn March 2013, Dropbox acquired Mailbox, a popular email app, with Mailbox CEO Gentry Underwood saying that \"Rather than grow Mailbox on our own, we've decided to join forces with Dropbox and build it out together\". Under the deal, the developers of Mailbox joined Dropbox, but kept Mailbox running as a stand-alone app. Mailbox CEO stated: \"We are still struggling to keep up with the demand from those who want to use it\", and Dropbox CEO Drew Houston said \"We felt we could help Mailbox reach a much different audience much faster\". The acquisition was reported to cost $100 million.\nIn December 2015, Dropbox announced the shut-down of Mailbox. In a blog post, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi explained that \"We'll [...] be using what we've learned from Mailbox to build new ways to communicate and collaborate on Dropbox\".\nCarousel.\nIn April 2014, Dropbox introduced Carousel, a photo and video gallery that \"combines the photos in your Dropbox with the photos on your phone, and automatically backs up new ones as you take them.\" Carousel sorted photos by event and date. In December 2015, Dropbox announced the shut-down of Carousel. In a blog post, Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi explained that \"We'll be taking key features from Carousel back to the place where your photos live - in the Dropbox app.\"\nDropbox Paper.\nIn April 2015, Dropbox launched a Dropbox Notes collaborative note-taking service in beta testing phase, prompting speculation if Dropbox was planning to bring out a product to compete with Google Docs. \"TechCrunch\" noted that Dropbox Notes appeared to be a new version of \"Project Composer\", a previous iteration of the service with roots from the acquisition of Hackpad in April 2014. In October 2015, Dropbox announced the upcoming launch of Dropbox Paper, its collaborative document editor, noted by the media as the result of its development of a Dropbox Notes service earlier in 2015. Dropbox Paper entered open beta in August 2016, allowing anyone to join and test the product. Mobile apps for Android and iOS were also released. In January 2017, Dropbox Paper was officially launched. Aimed for businesses, Dropbox Paper was described as \"one part online document, one part collaboration, one part task management tool, one part content hub\" by Rob Baesman, Dropbox's head of product, and allows for importing, editing, and collaboration on \"a number of other file types from Google, Microsoft, and others\".\nUser-created projects.\nUsers have devised a number of uses for and mashups of the technology that expand Dropbox's functionality. These include: sending files to a Dropbox via Gmail; using Dropbox to sync instant messaging chat logs; BitTorrent management; password management; remote application launching and system monitoring; and as a free web hosting service.\nReception.\nDropbox has received several awards, including the Crunchie Award in 2010 for Best Internet Application, and \"Macworld\"s 2009 Editor's Choice Award for Software. It was nominated for a 2010 Webby Award, and for the 2010 Mac Design Awards by \"Ars Technica.\" Dropbox's mobile iPhone app release in 2010 was among the top 10 \"best apps\" selected by Alex Ahlund, former CEO of two websites focused on mobile apps, and the company's Android app was also selected as one of the top five \"best apps\" in a list compiled in 2010 by Jason Hiner for \"ZDNet\". Founders Drew Houston and Arash Ferdowsi were named among the top 30 under 30 entrepreneurs by \"Inc.\" in 2011.\nIn 2011, \"Business Insider\" named Dropbox the world's sixth most valuable startup, and in 2017, the publication ranked Dropbox as the eighth most valuable US startup, with a valuation of $10 billion. It has been described as one of Y Combinator's most successful investments to date. Apple launched its own cloud storage service later in 2011, iCloud, but this didn't hold back Dropbox's growth. In January 2012, Dropbox was named startup of the year by \"TechCrunch\", and in 2016, the company was ranked #2 on the Forbes Cloud 100 list.\nPrivacy and security concerns.\nDropbox has been the subject of criticism and controversy related to multiple incidents, including a June 2011 authentication problem that let accounts be accessed for several hours without passwords; a July 2011 Privacy Policy update with language suggesting Dropbox had ownership of users' data; concerns about Dropbox employee access to users' information; July 2012 email spam with recurrence in February 2013; leaked government documents in June 2013 with information that Dropbox was being considered for inclusion in the National Security Agency's PRISM surveillance program; a July 2014 comment from NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden criticizing Dropbox's encryption keys being available to employees; the leak of 68\u00a0million account passwords on the Internet in August 2016; and a January 2017 accidental data restoration incident where years-old supposedly deleted files reappeared in users' accounts.\nWhile Dropbox uses SSL to encrypt data in transit between itself and customers, it stores data in encrypted form and does not use end-to-end encryption in which the user controls the keys used to encrypt the stored data. As a result, Dropbox can decrypt customers' data if it chooses to.\nOffices.\nThe Dropbox headquarters, located in San Francisco, were originally on Market Street, until its expansion to the China Basin Landing building in July 2011, allowing for a significant space increase. As the number of employees grew, the company again needed expansion, and in February 2014, it signed a lease for two buildings in Brannan Street. Not needing the substantial amounts of space after all, the company started shopping the remaining available space to other companies for sublease in November 2015.\nDropbox expanded into its second U.S. office in Austin, Texas in February 2014. The State of Texas and City of Austin provided a $1.7 million performance-based incentives package to Dropbox in exchange for locating their office in Austin.\nIn December 2012, Dropbox set up an office in Dublin, Ireland, its first office outside the United States."}
{"title": "PostgreSQL", "label": "Software", "text": "PostgreSQL (, ), also known as Postgres, is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) emphasizing extensibility and SQL compliance. It was originally named POSTGRES, referring to its origins as a successor to the Ingres database developed at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. After a review in 2007, the development team decided to keep the name PostgreSQL and the alias Postgres.\nPostgreSQL features transactions with Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability (ACID) properties, automatically updatable views, materialized views, triggers, foreign keys, and stored procedures. It is designed to handle a range of workloads, from single machines to data warehouses or Web services with many concurrent users. It is the default database for macOS Server and is also available for Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and OpenBSD.\nHistory.\nPostgreSQL evolved from the Ingres project at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1982, the leader of the Ingres team, Michael Stonebraker, left Berkeley to make a proprietary version of Ingres. He returned to Berkeley in 1985, and began a post-Ingres project to address the problems with contemporary database systems that had become increasingly clear during the early 1980s. He won the Turing Award in 2014 for these and other projects, and techniques pioneered in them.\nThe new project, POSTGRES, aimed to add the fewest features needed to completely support data types. These features included the ability to define types and to fully describe relationships something used widely, but maintained entirely by the user. In POSTGRES, the database understood relationships, and could retrieve information in related tables in a natural way using \"rules\". POSTGRES used many of the ideas of Ingres, but not its code.\nStarting in 1986, published papers described the basis of the system, and a prototype version was shown at the 1988 ACM SIGMOD Conference. The team released version 1 to a small number of users in June 1989, followed by version 2 with a re-written rules system in June 1990. Version 3, released in 1991, again re-wrote the rules system, and added support for multiple storage managers and an improved query engine. By 1993, the number of users began to overwhelm the project with requests for support and features. After releasing version 4.2 on June 30, 1994 primarily a cleanup the project ended. Berkeley released POSTGRES under an MIT License variant, which enabled other developers to use the code for any use. At the time, POSTGRES used an Ingres-influenced POSTQUEL query language interpreter, which could be interactively used with a console application named \"monitor\". \nIn 1994, Berkeley graduate students Andrew Yu and Jolly Chen replaced the POSTQUEL query language interpreter with one for the SQL query language, creating Postgres95. The \"monitor\" console was also replaced by psql. Yu and Chen announced the first version (0.01) to beta testers on May 5, 1995. Version 1.0 of Postgres95 was announced on September 5, 1995, with a more liberal license that enabled the software to be freely modifiable.\nOn July 8, 1996, Marc Fournier at Hub.org Networking Services provided the first non-university development server for the open-source development effort. With the participation of Bruce Momjian and Vadim B. Mikheev, work began to stabilize the code inherited from Berkeley.\nIn 1996, the project was renamed to PostgreSQL to reflect its support for SQL. The online presence at the website PostgreSQL.org began on October 22, 1996. The first PostgreSQL release formed version 6.0 on January 29, 1997. Since then developers and volunteers around the world have maintained the software as The PostgreSQL Global Development Group.\nThe project continues to make releases available under its free and open-source software PostgreSQL License. Code comes from contributions from proprietary vendors, support companies, and open-source programmers.\nMultiversion concurrency control (MVCC).\nPostgreSQL manages concurrency through multiversion concurrency control (MVCC), which gives each transaction a \"snapshot\" of the database, allowing changes to be made without affecting other transactions. This largely eliminates the need for read locks, and ensures the database maintains ACID principles. PostgreSQL offers three levels of transaction isolation: Read Committed, Repeatable Read and Serializable. Because PostgreSQL is immune to dirty reads, requesting a Read Uncommitted transaction isolation level provides read committed instead. PostgreSQL supports full serializability via the serializable snapshot isolation (SSI) method.\nStorage and replication.\nReplication.\nPostgreSQL includes built-in binary replication based on shipping the changes (write-ahead logs (WAL)) to replica nodes asynchronously, with the ability to run read-only queries against these replicated nodes. This allows splitting read traffic among multiple nodes efficiently. Earlier replication software that allowed similar read scaling normally relied on adding replication triggers to the master, increasing load.\nPostgreSQL includes built-in synchronous replication that ensures that, for each write transaction, the master waits until at least one replica node has written the data to its transaction log. Unlike other database systems, the durability of a transaction (whether it is asynchronous or synchronous) can be specified per-database, per-user, per-session or even per-transaction. This can be useful for workloads that do not require such guarantees, and may not be wanted for all data as it slows down performance due to the requirement of the confirmation of the transaction reaching the synchronous standby.\nStandby servers can be synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous standby servers can be specified in the configuration which determines which servers are candidates for synchronous replication. The first in the list that is actively streaming will be used as the current synchronous server. When this fails, the system fails over to the next in line.\nSynchronous multi-master replication is not included in the PostgreSQL core. Postgres-XC which is based on PostgreSQL provides scalable synchronous multi-master replication. It is licensed under the same license as PostgreSQL. A related project is called Postgres-XL. Postgres-R is yet another fork. Bidirectional replication (BDR) is an asynchronous multi-master replication system for PostgreSQL.\nTools such as repmgr make managing replication clusters easier.\nSeveral asynchronous trigger-based replication packages are available. These remain useful even after introduction of the expanded core abilities, for situations where binary replication of a full database cluster is inappropriate:\nIndexes.\nPostgreSQL includes built-in support for regular B-tree and hash table indexes, and four index access methods: generalized search trees (GiST), generalized inverted indexes (GIN), Space-Partitioned GiST (SP-GiST) and Block Range Indexes (BRIN). In addition, user-defined index methods can be created, although this is quite an involved process. Indexes in PostgreSQL also support the following features:\nSchemas.\nIn PostgreSQL, a schema holds all objects, except for roles and tablespaces. Schemas effectively act like namespaces, allowing objects of the same name to co-exist in the same database. By default, newly created databases have a schema called \"public\", but any further schemas can be added, and the public schema isn't mandatory.\nA setting determines the order in which PostgreSQL checks schemas for unqualified objects (those without a prefixed schema). By default, it is set to ( refers to the currently connected database user). This default can be set on a database or role level, but as it is a session parameter, it can be freely changed (even multiple times) during a client session, affecting that session only.\nNon-existent schemas listed in search_path are silently skipped during objects lookup.\nNew objects are created in whichever valid schema (one that presently exists) appears first in the search_path.\nData types.\nA wide variety of native data types are supported, including:\nIn addition, users can create their own data types which can usually be made fully indexable via PostgreSQL's indexing infrastructures GiST, GIN, SP-GiST. Examples of these include the geographic information system (GIS) data types from the PostGIS project for PostgreSQL.\nThere is also a data type called a \"domain\", which is the same as any other data type but with optional constraints defined by the creator of that domain. This means any data entered into a column using the domain will have to conform to whichever constraints were defined as part of the domain.\nA data type that represents a range of data can be used which are called range types. These can be discrete ranges (e.g. all integer values 1 to 10) or continuous ranges (e.g., any time between and ). The built-in range types available include ranges of integers, big integers, decimal numbers, time stamps (with and without time zone) and dates.\nCustom range types can be created to make new types of ranges available, such as IP address ranges using the inet type as a base, or float ranges using the float data type as a base. Range types support inclusive and exclusive range boundaries using the / and / characters respectively. (e.g., represents all integers starting from and including 4 up to but not including 9.) Range types are also compatible with existing operators used to check for overlap, containment, right of etc.\nUser-defined objects.\nNew types of almost all objects inside the database can be created, including:\nInheritance.\nTables can be set to inherit their characteristics from a \"parent\" table. Data in child tables will appear to exist in the parent tables, unless data is selected from the parent table using the ONLY keyword, i.e. . Adding a column in the parent table will cause that column to appear in the child table.\nInheritance can be used to implement table partitioning, using either triggers or rules to direct inserts to the parent table into the proper child tables.\n, this feature is not fully supported yet in particular, table constraints are not currently inheritable. All check constraints and not-null constraints on a parent table are automatically inherited by its children. Other types of constraints (unique, primary key, and foreign key constraints) are not inherited.\nInheritance provides a way to map the features of generalization hierarchies depicted in entity relationship diagrams (ERDs) directly into the PostgreSQL database.\nControl and connectivity.\nForeign data wrappers.\nPostgreSQL can link to other systems to retrieve data via foreign data wrappers (FDWs).\nThese can take the form of any data source, such as a file system, another relational database management system (RDBMS), or a web service. This means that regular database queries can use these data sources like regular tables, and even join multiple data-sources together.\nInterfaces.\nFor connecting to applications, PostgreSQL includes the built-in interfaces libpq (the official C application interface) and ECPG (an embedded C system). Third-party libraries for connecting to PostgreSQL are available for many programming languages, including C++, Java, Julia, Python, Node.js, Go, and Rust.\nProcedural languages.\nProcedural languages allow developers to extend the database with custom subroutines (functions), often called \"stored procedures\". These functions can be used to build database triggers (functions invoked on modification of certain data) and custom data types and aggregate functions. Procedural languages can also be invoked without defining a function, using a DO command at SQL level.\nLanguages are divided into two groups: Procedures written in \"safe\" languages are sandboxed and can be safely created and used by any user. Procedures written in \"unsafe\" languages can only be created by superusers, because they allow bypassing a database's security restrictions, but can also access sources external to the database. Some languages like Perl provide both safe and unsafe versions.\nPostgreSQL has built-in support for three procedural languages:\nIn addition, PostgreSQL allows procedural languages to be loaded into the database through extensions. Three language extensions are included with PostgreSQL to support Perl, Tcl, and Python. For Python, discontinued is used by default ( or ), even in PostgreSQL 14; is also supported by choosing the language ). External projects provide support for many other languages, including PL/Java, JavaScript (PL/V8), PL/Julia&lt;ref name=\"PL/Julia\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; PL/R, PL/Ruby, and others.\nTriggers.\nTriggers are events triggered by the action of SQL data manipulation language (DML) statements. For example, an INSERT statement might activate a trigger that checks if the values of the statement are valid. Most triggers are only activated by either INSERT or UPDATE statements.\nTriggers are fully supported and can be attached to tables. Triggers can be per-column and conditional, in that UPDATE triggers can target specific columns of a table, and triggers can be told to execute under a set of conditions as specified in the trigger's WHERE clause. Triggers can be attached to views by using the INSTEAD OF condition. Multiple triggers are fired in alphabetical order. In addition to calling functions written in the native PL/pgSQL, triggers can also invoke functions written in other languages like PL/Python or PL/Perl.\nAsynchronous notifications.\nPostgreSQL provides an asynchronous messaging system that is accessed through the NOTIFY, LISTEN and UNLISTEN commands. A session can issue a NOTIFY command, along with the user-specified channel and an optional payload, to mark a particular event occurring. Other sessions are able to detect these events by issuing a LISTEN command, which can listen to a particular channel. This functionality can be used for a wide variety of purposes, such as letting other sessions know when a table has updated or for separate applications to detect when a particular action has been performed. Such a system prevents the need for continuous polling by applications to see if anything has yet changed, and reducing unnecessary overhead. Notifications are fully transactional, in that messages are not sent until the transaction they were sent from is committed. This eliminates the problem of messages being sent for an action being performed which is then rolled back.\nMany connectors for PostgreSQL provide support for this notification system (including libpq, JDBC, Npgsql, psycopg and node.js) so it can be used by external applications.\nPostgreSQL can act as an effective, persistent \"pub/sub\" server or job server by combining LISTEN with FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED.\nRules.\nRules allow the \"query tree\" of an incoming query to be rewritten. \"Query Re-Write Rules\" are attached to a table/class and \"Re-Write\" the incoming DML (select, insert, update, and/or delete) into one or more queries that either replace the original DML statement or execute in addition to it. Query Re-Write occurs after DML statement parsing, but before query planning.\nConcurrency model.\nPostgreSQL server is process-based (not threaded), and uses one operating system process per database session. Multiple sessions are automatically spread across all available CPUs by the operating system. Many types of queries can also be parallelized across multiple background worker processes, taking advantage of multiple CPUs or cores. Client applications can use threads and create multiple database connections from each thread.\nSecurity.\nPostgreSQL manages its internal security on a per-role basis. A role is generally regarded to be a user (a role that can log in), or a group (a role of which other roles are members). Permissions can be granted or revoked on any object down to the column level, and can also allow/prevent the creation of new objects at the database, schema or table levels.\nPostgreSQL's SECURITY LABEL feature (extension to SQL standards), allows for additional security; with a bundled loadable module that supports label-based mandatory access control (MAC) based on Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) security policy.\nPostgreSQL natively supports a broad number of external authentication mechanisms, including:\nThe GSSAPI, SSPI, Kerberos, peer, ident and certificate methods can also use a specified \"map\" file that lists which users matched by that authentication system are allowed to connect as a specific database user.\nThese methods are specified in the cluster's host-based authentication configuration file (pg_hba.conf), which determines what connections are allowed. This allows control over which user can connect to which database, where they can connect from (IP address, IP address range, domain socket), which authentication system will be enforced, and whether the connection must use Transport Layer Security (TLS).\nStandards compliance.\nPostgreSQL claims high, but not complete, conformance with the latest SQL standard (for version 13 \"in September 2020, PostgreSQL conforms to at least 170 of the 179 mandatory features for Core conformance\", and no other databases fully conformed to it). One exception is the handling of unquoted identifiers like table or column names. In PostgreSQL they are folded, internally, to lower case characters whereas the standard says that unquoted identifiers should be folded to upper case. Thus, should be equivalent to not according to the standard.\nBenchmarks and performance.\nMany informal performance studies of PostgreSQL have been done. Performance improvements aimed at improving scalability began heavily with version 8.1. Simple benchmarks between version 8.0 and version 8.4 showed that the latter was more than 10 times faster on read-only workloads and at least 7.5 times faster on both read and write workloads.\nThe first industry-standard and peer-validated benchmark was completed in June 2007, using the Sun Java System Application Server (proprietary version of GlassFish) 9.0 Platform Edition, UltraSPARC T1-based Sun Fire server and PostgreSQL 8.2. This result of 778.14 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard compares favourably with the 874 JOPS@Standard with Oracle 10 on an Itanium-based HP-UX system.\nIn August 2007, Sun submitted an improved benchmark score of 813.73 SPECjAppServer2004 JOPS@Standard. With the system under test at a reduced price, the price/performance improved from $84.98/JOPS to $70.57/JOPS.\nThe default configuration of PostgreSQL uses only a small amount of dedicated memory for performance-critical purposes such as caching database blocks and sorting. This limitation is primarily because older operating systems required kernel changes to allow allocating large blocks of shared memory. PostgreSQL.org provides advice on basic recommended performance practice in a wiki.\nIn April 2012, Robert Haas of EnterpriseDB demonstrated PostgreSQL 9.2's linear CPU scalability using a server with 64 cores.\nMatloob Khushi performed benchmarking between PostgreSQL 9.0 and MySQL 5.6.15 for their ability to process genomic data. In his performance analysis he found that PostgreSQL extracts overlapping genomic regions eight times faster than MySQL using two datasets of 80,000 each forming random human DNA regions. Insertion and data uploads in PostgreSQL were also better, although general searching ability of both databases was almost equivalent.\nPlatforms.\nPostgreSQL is available for the following operating systems: Linux (all recent distributions), 64-bit x86 installers available and tested for macOS (OS X) version 10.6 and newer Windows (with installers available and tested for 64-bit Windows Server 2019 and 2016; some older PostgreSQL versions are tested back to Windows 2008 R2, while for PostgreSQL version 10 and older a 32-bit installer is available and tested down to 32-bit Windows 2008 R1; compilable by e.g. Visual Studio, version 2013 up to the most recent 2019 version) FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, AIX, HP-UX, Solaris, and UnixWare; and not officially tested: DragonFly BSD, BSD/OS, IRIX, OpenIndiana, OpenSolaris, OpenServer, and Tru64 UNIX . Most other Unix-like systems could also work; most modern do support.\nPostgreSQL works on any of the following instruction set architectures: x86 and x86-64 on Windows XP (or later) and other operating systems; these are supported on other than Windows: IA-64 Itanium (external support for HP-UX), PowerPC, PowerPC 64, S/390, S/390x, SPARC, SPARC 64, ARMv8-A (64-bit) and older ARM (32-bit, including older such as ARMv6 in Raspberry Pi), MIPS, MIPSel, and PA-RISC. It was also known to work on some other platforms (while not been tested on for years, i.e. for latest versions).\nDatabase administration.\nOpen source front-ends and tools for administering PostgreSQL include:\nA number of companies offer proprietary tools for PostgreSQL. They often consist of a universal core that is adapted for various specific database products. These tools mostly share the administration features with the open source tools but offer improvements in data modeling, importing, exporting or reporting.\nNotable users.\nNotable organizations and products that use PostgreSQL as the primary database include:\nService implementations.\nSome notable vendors offer PostgreSQL as software as a service:"}
{"title": "HyperCard", "label": "Software", "text": "HyperCard is a software application and development kit for Apple Macintosh and Apple IIGS computers. It is among the first successful hypermedia systems predating the World Wide Web.\nHyperCard combines a flat-file database with a graphical, flexible, user-modifiable interface. HyperCard includes a built-in programming language called HyperTalk for manipulating data and the user interface.\nThis combination of features \u2013 a database with simple form layout, flexible support for graphics, and ease of programming \u2013 suits HyperCard for many different projects such as rapid application development of applications and databases, interactive applications with no database requirements, command and control systems, and many examples in the demoscene.\nHyperCard was originally released in 1987 for $49.95 and was included free with all new Macs sold then. It was withdrawn from sale in March 2004, having received its final update in 1998 upon the return of Steve Jobs to Apple. HyperCard was not ported to Mac OS X, but can run in the Classic Environment on those Mac OS X that support it.\nOverview.\nDesign.\nHyperCard is based on the concept of a \"stack\" of virtual \"cards\". Cards hold data, just as they would in a Rolodex card-filing device. Each card contains a set of interactive objects, including text fields, check boxes, buttons, and similar common graphical user interface (GUI) elements. Users browse the stack by navigating from card to card, using built-in navigation features, a powerful search mechanism, or through user-created scripts.\nUsers build or modify stacks by adding new cards. They place GUI objects on the cards using an interactive layout engine based on a simple drag-and-drop interface. Also, HyperCard includes prototype or template cards called backgrounds; when new cards are created they can refer to one of these background cards, which causes all of the objects on the background to be copied onto the new card. This way, a stack of cards with a common layout and functionality can be created. The layout engine is similar in concept to a form as used in most rapid application development (RAD) environments such as Borland Delphi, and Microsoft Visual Basic and Visual Studio.\nThe database features of the HyperCard system are based on the storage of the state of all of the objects on the cards in the physical file representing the stack. The database does not exist as a separate system within the HyperCard stack; no database engine or similar construct exists. Instead, the state of any object in the system is considered to be live and editable at any time. From the HyperCard runtime's perspective, there is no difference between moving a text field on the card and typing into it, both operations simply change the state of the target object within the stack. Such changes are immediately saved when complete, so typing into a field causes that text to be stored to the stack's physical file. The system operates in a largely stateless fashion, with no need to save during operation. This is in common with many database-oriented systems, although somewhat different from document-based applications.\nThe final key element in HyperCard is the script, a single code-carrying element of every object within the stack. The script is a text field whose contents are interpreted in the HyperTalk language. Like any other property, the script of any object can be edited at any time and changes are saved as soon as they were complete. When the user invokes actions in the GUI, like clicking on a button or typing into a field, these actions are translated into events by the HyperCard runtime. The runtime then examines the script of the object that is the target of the event, like a button, to see if its script object contains the event's code, called a handler. If it does, the HyperTalk engine runs the handler; if it does not, the runtime examines other objects in the visual hierarchy.\nThese concepts make up the majority of the HyperCard system; stacks, backgrounds and cards provide a form-like GUI system, the stack file provides object persistence and database-like functionality, and HyperTalk allows handlers to be written for GUI events. Unlike the majority of RAD or database systems of the era, however, HyperCard combines all of these features, both user-facing and developer-facing, in a single application. This allows rapid turnaround and immediate prototyping, possibly without any coding, allowing users to author custom solutions to problems with their own personalized interface. \"Empowerment\" became a catchword as this possibility was embraced by the Macintosh community, as was the phrase \"programming for the rest of us\", that is, anyone, not just professional programmers.\nIt is this combination of features that also makes HyperCard a powerful hypermedia system. Users can build backgrounds to suit the needs of some system, say a rolodex, and use simple HyperTalk commands to provide buttons to move from place to place within the stack, or provide the same navigation system within the data elements of the UI, like text fields. Using these features, it is easy to build linked systems similar to hypertext links on the Web. Unlike the Web, programming, placement, and browsing are all the same tool. Similar systems have been created for HTML, but traditional Web services are considerably more heavyweight.\nHyperTalk.\nHyperCard contains an object oriented scripting language called HyperTalk, which was noted for having a syntax resembling casual English language. HyperTalk language features were predetermined by the HyperCard environment, although they could be extended by the use of externals functions (XFCN) and commands (XCMD), written in a compiled language. The weakly typed HyperTalk supports most standard programming structures such as \"if-then\" and \"repeat\". HyperTalk is verbose, hence its ease of use and readability. HyperTalk code segments are referred to as \"scripts\", a term that is considered less daunting to beginning programmers.\nExternals.\nHyperCard can be extended significantly through the use of \"external command\" (XCMD) and \"external function\" (XFCN) modules. These are code libraries packaged in a resource fork that integrate into either the system generally or the HyperTalk language specifically; this is an early example of the plug-in concept. Unlike conventional plug-ins, these do not require separate installation before they are available for use; they can be included in a stack, where they are directly available to scripts in that stack.\nDuring HyperCard's peak popularity in the late 1980s, a whole ecosystem of vendors offered thousands of these externals such as HyperTalk compilers, graphing systems, database access, Internet connectivity, and animation. Oracle offered an XCMD that allows HyperCard to directly query Oracle databases on any platform, superseded by Oracle Card. BeeHive Technologies offered a hardware interface that allows the computer to control external devices. Connected via the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), this instrument can read the state of connected external switches or write digital outputs to a multitude of devices.\nExternals allow access to the Macintosh Toolbox, which contains many lower-level commands and functions not native to HyperTalk, such as control of the serial and ADB ports.\nHistory.\nDevelopment.\nHyperCard was created by Bill Atkinson following an LSD trip. Work for it began in March 1985 under the name of WildCard (hence its creator code of WILD). In 1986, Dan Winkler began work on HyperTalk and the name was changed to HyperCard for trademark reasons. It was released on 11 August 1987 for the first day of the MacWorld Conference &amp; Expo in Boston, with the understanding that Atkinson would give HyperCard to Apple only if the company promised to release it for free on all Macs. Apple timed its release to coincide with the MacWorld Conference &amp; Expo in Boston, Massachusetts to guarantee maximum publicity.\nLaunch.\nHyperCard was successful almost instantly. The Apple Programmer's and Developer's Association (APDA) said, \"HyperCard has been an informational feeding frenzy. From August [1987, when it was announced] to October our phones never stopped ringing. It was a zoo.\" Within a few months of release, there were multiple HyperCard books and a 50 disk set of public domain stacks. Apple's project managers found HyperCard was being used by a huge number of people, internally and externally. Bug reports and upgrade suggestions continued to flow in, demonstrating its wide variety of users. Since it was also free, it was difficult to justify dedicating engineering resources to improvements in the software. Apple and its mainstream developers understood that HyperCard's user empowerment could reduce the sales of ordinary shrink-wrapped products. Stewart Alsop II speculated that HyperCard might replace Finder as the shell of the Macintosh graphical user interface.\nHyperCard 2.0.\nIn late 1989, Kevin Calhoun, then a HyperCard engineer at Apple, led an effort to upgrade the program. This resulted in HyperCard 2.0, released in 1990. The new version included an on-the-fly compiler that greatly increased performance of computationally intensive code, a new debugger and many improvements to the underlying HyperTalk language.\nAt the same time HyperCard 2.0 was being developed, a separate group within Apple developed and in 1991 released HyperCard IIGS, a version of HyperCard for the Apple IIGS system. Aimed mainly at the education market, HyperCard IIGS has roughly the same feature set as the 1.x versions of Macintosh HyperCard, while adding support for the color graphics abilities of the IIGS. Although \"stacks\" (HyperCard program documents) are not binary-compatible, a translator program (another HyperCard stack) allows them to be moved from one platform to the other.\nThen, Apple decided that most of its application software packages, including HyperCard, would be the property of a wholly owned subsidiary called Claris. Many of the HyperCard developers chose to stay at Apple rather than move to Claris, causing the development team to be split. Claris attempted to create a business model where HyperCard could also generate revenues. At first the freely-distributed versions of HyperCard shipped with authoring disabled. Early versions of Claris HyperCard contain an Easter Egg: typing \"magic\" into the message box converts the player into a full HyperCard authoring environment. When this trick became nearly universal, they wrote a new version, HyperCard Player, which Apple distributed with the Macintosh operating system, while Claris sold the full version commercially. Many users were upset that they had to pay to use software that had traditionally been supplied free and which many considered a basic part of the Mac.\nEven after HyperCard was generating revenue, Claris did little to market it. Development continued with minor upgrades, and the first failed attempt to create a third generation of HyperCard. During this period, HyperCard began losing market share. Without several important, basic features, HyperCard authors began moving to systems such as SuperCard and Macromedia Authorware. Nonetheless, HyperCard continued to be popular and used for a widening range of applications, from the game \"The Manhole\", an earlier effort by the creators of \"Myst\", to corporate information services.\nApple eventually folded Claris back into the parent company, returning HyperCard to Apple's core engineering group. In 1992, Apple released the eagerly anticipated upgrade of HyperCard 2.2 and included licensed versions of Color Tools and Addmotion II, adding support for color pictures and animations. However, these tools are limited and often cumbersome to use because HyperCard 2.0 lacks true, internal color support.\nHyperCard 3.0.\nSeveral attempts were made to restart HyperCard development once it returned to Apple. Because of the product's widespread use as a multimedia-authoring tool it was rolled into the QuickTime group. A new effort to allow HyperCard to create QuickTime interactive (QTi) movies started, once again under the direction of Kevin Calhoun. QTi extended QuickTime's core multimedia playback features to provide true interactive facilities and a low-level programming language based on 68000 assembly language. The resulting HyperCard 3.0 was first presented in 1996 when an alpha-quality version was shown to developers at Apple's annual Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). Under the leadership of Dan Crow development continued through the late 1990s, with public demos showing many popular features such as color support, Internet connectivity, and the ability to play HyperCard stacks (which were now special QuickTime movies) in a web browser. Development upon HyperCard 3.0 stalled when the QuickTime team was focused away from developing QuickTime interactive to the streaming features of QuickTime 4.0. in 1998 Steve Jobs disliked the software because Atkinson had chosen to stay at Apple to finish it instead of joining Jobs at NeXT, and (according to Atkinson) \"it had Sculley's stink all over it\". In 2000, the HyperCard engineering team was reassigned to other tasks after Jobs decided to abandon the product. Calhoun and Crow both left Apple shortly after, in 2001.\nIts final release was in 1998, and it was totally discontinued in March 2004.\nHyperCard runs natively only in the classic Mac OS, but it can still be used in Mac OS X's Classic mode on PowerPC based machines (G5 and earlier). The last functional native HyperCard authoring environment is Classic mode in Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger) on PowerPC-based machines.\nApplications.\nHyperCard has been used for a range of hypertext and artistic purposes. Before the advent of PowerPoint, HyperCard was often used as a general-purpose presentation program. Examples of HyperCard applications include simple databases, \"choose your own adventure\"-type games, and educational teaching aids.\nDue to its rapid application design facilities, HyperCard was also often used for prototyping applications and sometimes even for version 1.0 implementations. Inside Apple, the QuickTime team was one of HyperCard's biggest customers.\nHyperCard has lower hardware requirements than Macromedia Director. Several commercial software products were created in HyperCard, most notably the original version of the graphic adventure game \"Myst\", the Voyager Company's Expanded Books, multimedia CD-ROMs of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony CD-ROM, \"A Hard Day's Night\" by the Beatles, and the Voyager \"MacBeth\". An early electronic edition of the \"Whole Earth Catalog\" was implemented in HyperCard. and stored on CD-ROM.\nThe prototype and demo of the popular game \"You Don't Know Jack\" was written in HyperCard. The French auto manufacturer Renault used it to control their inventory system.\nIn Quebec, Canada, HyperCard was used to control a robot arm used to insert and retrieve video disks at the National Film Board Cin\u00e9Roboth\u00e8que.\nHyperCard was used to prototype a fully functional prototype of SIDOCI (one of the first experiments in the world to develop an integrated electronic patient record system) and was heavily used by Montr\u00e9al Consulting firm DMR to demonstrate how \"a typical day in the life of a patient about to get surgery\" would look like in a paperless age.\nActivision, which was until then mainly a game company, saw HyperCard as an entry point into the business market. Changing its name to Mediagenic, it published several major HyperCard-based applications, most notably Danny Goodman's Focal Point, a personal information manager, and Reports For HyperCard, a program by Nine To Five Software that allows users to treat HyperCard as a full database system with robust information viewing and printing features.\nThe HyperCard-inspired SuperCard for a while included the \"Roadster\" plug-in that allowed stacks to be placed inside web pages and viewed by web browsers with an appropriate browser plug-in. There was even a Windows version of this plug-in allowing computers other than Macintoshes to use the plug-in.\nExploits.\nThe first HyperCard virus was discovered in Belgium and the Netherlands in April 1991.\nBecause HyperCard executed scripts in stacks immediately on opening, it was also one of the first applications susceptible to macro viruses. The Merryxmas virus was discovered in early 1993 by Ken Dunham, two years before the \"Concept\" virus. Very few viruses were based on HyperCard, and their overall impact was minimal.\nReception.\n\"Compute!'s Apple Applications\" in 1987 stated that HyperCard \"may make Macintosh the personal computer of choice\". While noting that its large memory requirement made it best suited for computers with 2\u00a0MB of memory and hard drives, the magazine predicted that \"the smallest programming shop should be able to turn out stackware\", especially for using CD-ROMs. \"Compute!\" predicted in 1988 that most future Mac software would be developed using HyperCard, if only because using it was so addictive that developers \"won't be able to tear themselves away from it long enough to create anything else\". \"Byte\" in 1989 listed it as among the \"Excellence\" winners of the Byte Awards. While stating that \"like any first entry, it has some flaws\", the magazine wrote that \"HyperCard opened up a new category of software\", and praised Apple for bundling it with every Mac. In 2001 Steve Wozniak called HyperCard \"the best program ever written\".\nLegacy.\nHyperCard is one of the first products that made use of and popularized the hypertext concept to a large popular base of users.\nJakob Nielsen has pointed out that HyperCard was really only a hypermedia program since its links started from regions on a card, not text objects; actual HTML-style text hyperlinks were possible in later versions, but were awkward to implement and seldom used. Deena Larsen programmed links into HyperCard for Marble Springs. Bill Atkinson later lamented that if he had only realized the power of network-oriented stacks, instead of focusing on local stacks on a single machine, HyperCard could have become the first Web browser.\nHyperCard saw a loss in popularity with the growth of the World Wide Web, since the Web could handle and deliver data in much the same way as HyperCard without being limited to files on a local hard disk. HyperCard had a significant impact on the web as it inspired the creation of both HTTP (through its influence on Tim Berners-Lee's colleague Robert Cailliau), and JavaScript (whose creator, Brendan Eich, was inspired by HyperTalk). It was also a key inspiration for ViolaWWW, an early web browser.\nThe pointing-finger cursor used for navigating stacks was later used in the first web browsers, as the hyperlink cursor.\nThe \"Myst\" computer game franchise, initially released as a HyperCard stack and included bundled with some Macs (for example the Performa 5300), still lives on, making HyperCard a facilitating technology for starting one of the best-selling computer games of all time.\nAccording to Ward Cunningham, the inventor of Wiki, the wiki concept can be traced back to a HyperCard stack he wrote in the late 1980s.\nIn 2017 the Internet Archive established a project to preserve and emulate HyperCard stacks, allowing users to upload their own.\nThe GUI of the prototype Apple Wizzy Active Lifestyle Telephone was based on HyperCard.\nWorld Wide Web.\nHyperCard influenced the development of the Web in late 1990 through its influence on Robert Cailliau, who assisted in developing Tim Berners-Lee's first Web browser. Javascript was inspired by HyperTalk.\nAlthough HyperCard stacks do not operate over the Internet, by 1988, at least 300 stacks were publicly available for download from the commercial CompuServe network (which was not connected to the official Internet yet). The system can link phone numbers on a user's computer together and enable them to dial numbers without a modem, using a less expensive piece of hardware, the Hyperdialer.\nIn this sense, like the Web, it does form an association-based experience of information browsing via links, though not operating remotely over the TCP/IP protocol then. Like the Web, it also allows for the connections of many different kinds of media.\nSimilar systems.\nOther companies have offered their own versions. , four products are available which offer HyperCard-like abilities:\nPast products include:\nIn addition, many of the basic concepts of the original system were later re-used in other forms. Apple built its system-wide scripting engine AppleScript on a language similar to HyperTalk; it is often used for desktop publishing (DTP) workflow automation needs. In the 1990s FaceSpan provided a third-party graphical interface. AppleScript also has a native graphical programming front-end called Automator, released with Mac OS X Tiger in April 2005. One of HyperCard's strengths was its handling of multimedia, and many multimedia systems like Macromedia Authorware and Macromedia Director are based on concepts originating in HyperCard.\nAppWare, originally named Serius Developer, is sometimes seen to be similar to HyperCard, as both are rapid application development (RAD) systems. AppWare was sold in the early 90s and worked on both Mac and Windows systems.\nZoomracks, a DOS application with a similar \"stack\" database metaphor, predates HyperCard by 4 years, which led to a contentious lawsuit against Apple."}
{"title": "DirectX", "label": "Software", "text": "Microsoft DirectX is a collection of application programming interfaces (APIs) for handling tasks related to multimedia, especially game programming and video, on Microsoft platforms. Originally, the names of these APIs all began with \"Direct\", such as Direct3D, DirectDraw, DirectMusic, DirectPlay, DirectSound, and so forth. The name \"DirectX\" was coined as a shorthand term for all of these APIs (the \"X\" standing in for the particular API names) and soon became the name of the collection. When Microsoft later set out to develop a gaming console, the \"X\" was used as the basis of the name Xbox to indicate that the console was based on DirectX technology. The \"X\" initial has been carried forward in the naming of APIs designed for the Xbox such as XInput and the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT), while the DirectX pattern has been continued for Windows APIs such as Direct2D and DirectWrite.\nDirect3D (the 3D graphics API within DirectX) is widely used in the development of video games for Microsoft Windows and the Xbox line of consoles. Direct3D is also used by other software applications for visualization and graphics tasks such as CAD/CAM engineering. As Direct3D is the most widely publicized component of DirectX, it is common to see the names \"DirectX\" and \"Direct3D\" used interchangeably.\nThe DirectX software development kit (SDK) consists of runtime libraries in redistributable binary form, along with accompanying documentation and headers for use in coding. Originally, the runtimes were only installed by games or explicitly by the user. Windows 95 did not launch with DirectX, but DirectX was included with Windows 95 OEM Service Release 2. Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0 both shipped with DirectX, as has every version of Windows released since. The SDK is available as a free download. While the runtimes are proprietary, closed-source software, source code is provided for most of the SDK samples. Starting with the release of Windows 8 Developer Preview, DirectX SDK has been integrated into Windows SDK.\nDevelopment history.\nIn late 1994, Microsoft was ready to release Windows 95, its next operating system. An important factor in the value consumers would place on it was the programs that would be able to run on it. Microsoft employee Alex St. John had been in discussions with various game developers asking how likely they would be to bring their MS-DOS games to Windows 95, and found the responses mostly negative; programmers had found the Windows environment more difficult to develop for compared to MS-DOS or other gaming platforms. There were also strong fears of compatibility; a notable case of this was from \"Disney's Animated Storybook: The Lion King\" which was based on the WinG programming interface. Due to numerous incompatible graphics drivers from new Compaq computers that were not tested with the WinG interface which came bundled with the game, it crashed so frequently on many desktop systems that parents had flooded Disney's call-in help lines.\nSt. John recognized the resistances for game development under Windows would be a limitation, and recruited two additional engineers, Craig Eisler and Eric Engstrom, to develop a better solution to get more programmers to develop games for Windows. The project was codenamed the Manhattan Project, as in relation to the World War II project of the same name, the idea was to displace the Japanese-developed video game consoles with personal computers running Microsoft's operating system. It had initially used the radiation symbol as its logo but Microsoft asked the team to change the logo. Management did not agree to the project as they were already writing off Windows as a gaming platform, but the three committed towards this project's development. Their rebellious nature led Brad Silverberg, the senior vice president of Microsoft's office products, to name the trio the \"Beastie Boys\".\nMost of the work by the three was done among other assigned projects starting near the end of 1994. Within four months and with input from several hardware manufacturers, the team had developed the first set of application programming interfaces (APIs) which they presented at the 1995 Game Developers Conference. The SDK included libraries such as DirectDraw for graphic routines, DirectSound for audio, and DirectPlay for networking communications. The \"Direct\" part of the library was named as these routines typically bypassed core Windows 95 routines and accessed the computer hardware directly. Though the team had named it the \"Game SDK\" (software development kit), the name \"DirectX\" came from one journalist that had mocked the naming scheme of the various libraries. The team opted to continue to use that naming scheme and call the project DirectX.\nThe first version of DirectX was released in September 1995 as the Windows Games SDK. It was the Win32 replacement for the DCI and WinG APIs for Windows 3.1. DirectX allowed all versions of Microsoft Windows, starting with Windows 95, to incorporate high-performance multimedia. Eisler wrote about the frenzy to build DirectX 1 through 5 in his blog.\nTo get more developers on board DirectX, Microsoft approached id Software's John Carmack and offered to port \"Doom\" and \"Doom 2\" from MS-DOS to DirectX, free of charge, with id retaining all publishing rights to the game. Carmack agreed, and Microsoft's Gabe Newell led the porting project. The first game was released as \"Doom 95\" in August 1996, the first published DirectX game. Microsoft promoted the game heavily with Bill Gates appearing in ads for the title.\nDirectX 2.0 became a component of Windows itself with the releases of Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4.0 in mid-1996. Since Windows 95 was itself still new and few games had been released for it, Microsoft engaged in heavy promotion of DirectX to developers who were generally distrustful of Microsoft's ability to build a gaming platform in Windows. Alex St. John, the evangelist for DirectX, staged an elaborate event at the 1996 Computer Game Developers Conference which game developer Jay Barnson described as a Roman theme, including real lions, togas, and something resembling an indoor carnival. It was at this event that Microsoft first introduced Direct3D and DirectPlay, and demonstrated multiplayer \"MechWarrior 2\" being played over the Internet.\nThe DirectX team faced the challenging task of testing each DirectX release against an array of computer hardware and software. A variety of different graphics cards, audio cards, motherboards, CPUs, input devices, games, and other multimedia applications were tested with each beta and final release. The DirectX team also built and distributed tests that allowed the hardware industry to confirm that new hardware designs and driver releases would be compatible with DirectX.\nPrior to DirectX, Microsoft had included OpenGL on their Windows NT platform. At the time, OpenGL required \"high-end\" hardware and was focused on engineering and CAD uses. Direct3D was intended to be a Microsoft controlled alternative to OpenGL, focused initially on game use. As 3D gaming grew, OpenGL developed to include better support for programming techniques for interactive multimedia applications like games, giving developers choice between using OpenGL or Direct3D as the 3D graphics API for their applications. At that point a \"battle\" began between supporters of the cross-platform OpenGL and the Windows-only Direct3D. Incidentally, OpenGL was supported at Microsoft by the DirectX team. If a developer chose to use OpenGL 3D graphics API, the other APIs of DirectX are often combined with OpenGL in computer games because OpenGL does not include all of DirectX's functionality (such as sound or joystick support).\nIn a console-specific version, DirectX was used as a basis for Microsoft's Xbox, Xbox 360 and Xbox One console API. The API was developed jointly between Microsoft and Nvidia, which developed the custom graphics hardware used by the original Xbox. The Xbox API was similar to DirectX version 8.1, but is non-updateable like other console technologies. The Xbox was code named DirectXbox, but this was shortened to Xbox for its commercial name.\nIn 2002, Microsoft released DirectX 9 with support for the use of much longer shader programs than before with pixel and vertex shader version 2.0. Microsoft has continued to update the DirectX suite since then, introducing Shader Model 3.0 in DirectX 9.0c, released in August 2004.\nAs of April 2005, DirectShow was removed from DirectX and moved to the Microsoft Platform SDK instead.\nDirectX has been confirmed to be present in Microsoft's Windows Phone 8.\nReal-time raytracing was announced as DXR in 2018.\nLogos.\nThe original logo resembled a deformed radiation warning symbol. Controversially, the original name for the DirectX project was the \"Manhattan Project\", a reference to the US nuclear weapons initiative. Alex St. John, head of Microsoft DirectX evangelism at the time, claims that the connotation of the ultimate outcome of the Manhattan Project (the nuclear bombing of Japan) is intentional, and that DirectX and its sister project, the Xbox (which shares a similar logo), were meant to displace Japanese videogame-makers from their dominance of the video game industry. However, Microsoft publicly denies this account, instead claiming that the logo is merely an artistic design.\nComponents.\nDirectX is composed of multiple APIs:\nMicrosoft has deprecated the following components:\nDirectX functionality is provided in the form of COM-style objects and interfaces. Additionally, while not DirectX components themselves, managed objects have been built on top of some parts of DirectX, such as Managed Direct3D and the XNA graphics library on top of Direct3D 9.\nMicrosoft distributes debugging tool for DirectX called \"PIX\".\nVersions.\nDirectX 9.\nDirectX 9 was released in 2002 for Windows 98, Me, and XP, and currently is supported by all subsequent versions. Microsoft continues to make changes in DirectX 9.0c, causing support to be dropped for some of the aforementioned operating systems. As of January 2007, Windows 2000 or XP is required. This also introduced Shader Model 2.0 containing Pixel Shader 2.0 and Vertex Shader 2.0. Windows XP SP2 and newer include DirectX 9.0c, but may require a newer DirectX runtime redistributable installation for DirectX 9.0c applications compiled with the February 2005 DirectX 9.0 SDK or newer.\nDirectX 10.\nA major update to DirectX API, DirectX 10 ships with and is only available with Windows Vista and later; previous versions of Windows such as Windows XP are not able to run DirectX 10-exclusive applications. Rather, programs that are run on a Windows XP system with DirectX 10 hardware simply resort to the DirectX 9.0c code path, the latest available for Windows XP computers.\nChanges for DirectX 10 were extensive. Many former parts of DirectX API were deprecated in the latest DirectX SDK and are preserved for compatibility only: DirectInput was deprecated in favor of XInput, DirectSound was deprecated in favor of the Cross-platform Audio Creation Tool system (XACT) and additionally lost support for hardware accelerated audio, since the Vista audio stack renders sound in software on the CPU. The DirectPlay DPLAY.DLL was also removed and was replaced with dplayx.dll; games that rely on this DLL must duplicate it and rename it to dplay.dll.\nIn order to achieve backwards compatibility, DirectX in Windows Vista contains several versions of Direct3D:\nDirect3D 10.1 is an incremental update of Direct3D 10.0 which shipped with, and required, Windows Vista Service Pack 1. This release mainly sets a few more image quality standards for graphics vendors, while giving developers more control over image quality. It also adds support for cube map arrays, separate blend modes per-MRT, coverage mask export from a pixel shader, ability to run pixel shader per sample, access to multi-sampled depth buffers and requires that the video card supports Shader Model 4.1 or higher and 32-bit floating-point operations. Direct3D 10.1 still fully supports Direct3D 10 hardware, but in order to utilize all of the new features, updated hardware is required.\nDirectX 11.\nMicrosoft unveiled DirectX 11 at the Gamefest 08 event in Seattle, with the major scheduled features including GPGPU support (DirectCompute), and Direct3D 11 with tessellation support and improved multi-threading support to assist video game developers in developing games that better utilize multi-core processors. Direct3D 11 runs on Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10. Parts of the new API such as multi-threaded resource handling can be supported on Direct3D 9/10/10.1-class hardware. Hardware tessellation and Shader Model 5.0 require Direct3D 11 supporting hardware. Microsoft has since released the Direct3D 11 Technical Preview. Direct3D 11 is a strict superset of Direct3D 10.1 \u2014 all hardware and API features of version 10.1 are retained, and new features are added only when necessary for exposing new functionality. This helps to keep backwards compatibility with previous versions of DirectX.\nMicrosoft released the Final Platform Update for Windows Vista on October 27, 2009, which was 5 days after the initial release of Windows 7 (launched with Direct3D 11 as a base standard).\nSince then, four updates for DirectX 11 were released:\nDirectX 12.\nDirectX 12 was announced by Microsoft at GDC on March 20, 2014, and was officially launched alongside Windows 10 on July 29, 2015.\nThe primary feature highlight for the new release of DirectX was the introduction of advanced low-level programming APIs for Direct3D 12 which can reduce driver overhead. Developers are now able to implement their own command lists and buffers to the GPU, allowing for more efficient resource utilization through parallel computation. Lead developer Max McMullen stated that the main goal of Direct3D 12 is to achieve \"console-level efficiency on phone, tablet and PC\". The release of Direct3D 12 comes alongside other initiatives for low-overhead graphics APIs including AMD's Mantle for AMD graphics cards, Apple's Metal for iOS and macOS and Khronos Group's cross-platform Vulkan.\nMultiadapter support will feature in DirectX 12 allowing developers to utilize multiple GPUs on a system simultaneously; multi-GPU support was previously dependent on vendor implementations such as AMD CrossFireX or NVIDIA SLI.\nDirectX 12 is supported on all Fermi and later Nvidia GPUs, on AMD's GCN-based chips and on Intel's Haswell and later processors' graphics units.\nAt SIGGRAPH 2014, Intel released a demo showing a computer generated asteroid field, in which DirectX 12 was claimed to be 50\u201370% more efficient than DirectX 11 in rendering speed and CPU power consumption.\n\"Ashes of the Singularity\" was the first publicly available game to utilize DirectX 12. Testing by \"Ars Technica\" in August 2015 revealed slight performance regressions in DirectX 12 over DirectX 11 mode for the Nvidia GeForce 980 Ti, whereas the AMD Radeon R9 290x achieved consistent performance improvements of up to 70% under DirectX 12, and in some scenarios the AMD outperformed the more powerful Nvidia under DirectX 12. The performance discrepancies may be due to poor Nvidia driver optimizations for DirectX 12, or even hardware limitations of the card which was optimized for DirectX 11 serial execution; however, the exact cause remains unclear.\nThe performance improvements of DirectX 12 on the Xbox are not as substantial as on the PC.\nIn March 2018, DirectX Raytracing (DXR) was announced, capable of real-time ray-tracing on supported hardware, and the DXR API was added in the Windows 10 October 2018 update.\nIn 2019 Microsoft announced the arrival of DirectX 12 to Windows 7 but only as a plug-in for certain game titles.\nDirectX 12 Ultimate.\nMicrosoft revealed DirectX 12 Ultimate in March 2020. DirectX 12 Ultimate will unify to a common library on both Windows 10 computers and the Xbox Series X and other ninth-generation Xbox consoles. Among the new features in Ultimate includes DirectX Raytracing 1.1, Variable Rate Shading, which gives programmers control over the level of detail of shading depending on design choices, Mesh Shaders, and Sampler Feedback.\nVersion history.\nThe version number as reported by Microsoft's DxDiag tool (version 4.09.0000.0900 and higher) use the x.xx.xxxx.xxxx format for version numbers. However, the DirectX and Windows XP MSDN page claims that the registry always has been in the x.xx.xx.xxxx format. Therefore, when the above table lists a version as '4.09.00.0904' Microsoft's DxDiag tool may have it as '4.09.0000.0904'.\nCompatibility.\nVarious releases of Windows have included and supported various versions of DirectX, allowing newer versions of the operating system to continue running applications designed for earlier versions of DirectX until those versions can be gradually phased out in favor of newer APIs, drivers, and hardware.\nAPIs such as Direct3D and DirectSound need to interact with hardware, and they do this through a device driver. Hardware manufacturers have to write these drivers for a particular DirectX version's device driver interface (or DDI), and test each individual piece of hardware to make them DirectX compatible. Some hardware devices have only DirectX compatible drivers (in other words, one must install DirectX in order to use that hardware). Early versions of DirectX included an up-to-date library of all of the DirectX compatible drivers currently available. This practice was stopped however, in favor of the web-based Windows Update driver-update system, which allowed users to download only the drivers relevant to their hardware, rather than the entire library.\nPrior to DirectX 10, DirectX runtime was designed to be \"backward compatible\" with older drivers, meaning that newer versions of the APIs were designed to interoperate with older drivers written against a previous version's DDI. The application programmer had to query the available hardware capabilities using a complex system of \"cap bits\" each tied to a particular hardware feature. Direct3D 7 and earlier would work on any version of the DDI, Direct3D 8 requires a minimum DDI level of 6 and Direct3D 9 requires a minimum DDI level of 7.\nHowever, the Direct3D 10 runtime in Windows Vista cannot run on older hardware drivers due to the significantly updated DDI, which requires a unified feature set and abandons the use of \"cap bits\".\nDirect3D 10.1 introduces \"feature levels\" 10_0 and 10_1, which allow use of only the hardware features defined in the specified version of Direct3D API. Direct3D 11 adds level 11_0 and \"10 Level 9\" - a subset of the Direct3D 10 API designed to run on Direct3D 9 hardware, which has three feature levels (9_1, 9_2 and 9_3) grouped by common capabilities of \"low\", \"med\" and \"high-end\" video cards; the runtime directly uses Direct3D 9 DDI provided in all WDDM drivers. Feature level 11_1 has been introduced with Direct3D 11.1.\n.NET Framework.\nIn 2002, Microsoft released a version of DirectX compatible with the Microsoft .NET Framework, thus allowing programmers to take advantage of DirectX functionality from within .NET applications using compatible languages such as managed C++ or the use of the C# programming language. This API was known as \"Managed DirectX\" (or MDX for short), and claimed to operate at 98% of performance of the underlying native DirectX APIs. In December 2005, February 2006, April 2006, and August 2006, Microsoft released successive updates to this library, culminating in a beta version called Managed DirectX 2.0. While Managed DirectX 2.0 consolidated functionality that had previously been scattered over multiple assemblies into a single assembly, thus simplifying dependencies on it for software developers, development on this version has subsequently been discontinued, and it is no longer supported. The Managed DirectX 2.0 library expired on October 5, 2006.\nDuring the GDC 2006, Microsoft presented the XNA Framework, a new managed version of DirectX (similar but not identical to Managed DirectX) that is intended to assist development of games by making it easier to integrate DirectX, HLSL and other tools in one package. It also supports the execution of managed code on the Xbox 360. The XNA Game Studio Express RTM was made available on December 11, 2006, as a free download for Windows XP. Unlike the DirectX runtime, Managed DirectX, XNA Framework or the Xbox 360 APIs (XInput, XACT etc.) have not shipped as part of Windows. Developers are expected to redistribute the runtime components along with their games or applications.\nNo Microsoft product including the latest XNA releases provides DirectX 10 support for the .NET Framework.\nThe other approach for DirectX in managed languages is to use third-party libraries like:\nAlternatives.\nThere are alternatives to the DirectX family of APIs, with OpenGL, its successor Vulkan, Metal and Mantle having the most features comparable to Direct3D. Examples of other APIs include SDL, Allegro, OpenMAX, OpenML, OpenAL, OpenCL, FMOD, SFML etc. Many of these libraries are cross-platform or have open codebases. There are also alternative implementations that aim to provide the same API, such as the one in Wine. Furthermore, the developers of ReactOS are trying to reimplement DirectX under the name \"ReactX\"."}
{"title": "Camille_Pissarro", "label": "Artist", "text": "Camille Pissarro ( , ; 10 July 1830\u00a0\u2013 13 November 1903) was a Danish-French Impressionist and Neo-Impressionist painter born on the island of St Thomas (now in the US Virgin Islands, but then in the Danish West Indies). His importance resides in his contributions to both Impressionism and Post-Impressionism. Pissarro studied from great forerunners, including Gustave Courbet and Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot. He later studied and worked alongside Georges Seurat and Paul Signac when he took on the Neo-Impressionist style at the age of 54.\nIn 1873 he helped establish a collective society of fifteen aspiring artists, becoming the \"pivotal\" figure in holding the group together and encouraging the other members. Art historian John Rewald called Pissarro the \"dean of the Impressionist painters\", not only because he was the oldest of the group, but also \"by virtue of his wisdom and his balanced, kind, and warmhearted personality\". Paul C\u00e9zanne said \"he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord\", and he was also one of Paul Gauguin's masters. Pierre-Auguste Renoir referred to his work as \"revolutionary\", through his artistic portrayals of the \"common man\", as Pissarro insisted on painting individuals in natural settings without \"artifice or grandeur\".\nPissarro is the only artist to have shown his work at all eight Paris Impressionist exhibitions, from 1874 to 1886. He \"acted as a father figure not only to the Impressionists\" but to all four of the major Post-Impressionists, C\u00e9zanne, Seurat, Gauguin, and van Gogh.\nEarly years.\nJacob Abraham Camille Pissarro was born on 10 July 1830 on the island of St. Thomas to Frederick Abraham Gabriel Pissarro and Rachel Manzano-Pomi\u00e9. His father was of Portuguese Jewish descent and held French nationality. His mother was from a French-Jewish family from the island of St. Thomas. His father was a merchant who came to the island from France to deal with the hardware store of a deceased uncle, Isaac Petit, and married his widow. The marriage caused a stir within St. Thomas's small Jewish community because she was previously married to Frederick's uncle and according to Jewish law a man is forbidden from marrying his aunt. In subsequent years his four children attended the all-black primary school. Upon his death, his will specified that his estate be split equally between the synagogue and St. Thomas' Protestant church.\nWhen Camille was twelve his father sent him to boarding school in France. He studied at the Savary Academy in Passy near Paris. While a young student, he developed an early appreciation of the French art masters. Monsieur Savary himself gave him a strong grounding in drawing and painting and suggested he draw from nature when he returned to St. Thomas, which he did when he was seventeen. However, his father preferred he work in his business as a port clerk. He took every opportunity during those next five years at the job to practice drawing during breaks and after work.\nWhen Pissarro turned twenty-one, Danish artist Fritz Melbye, then living on St. Thomas, inspired him to take on painting as a full-time profession, becoming his teacher and friend. Pissarro then chose to leave his family and job and live in Venezuela, where he and Melbye spent the next two years working as artists in Caracas and La Guaira. He drew everything he could, including landscapes, village scenes, and numerous sketches, enough to fill up multiple sketchbooks. In 1855 he moved back to Paris where he began working as assistant to Anton Melbye, Fritz Melbye's brother.\nLife in France.\nIn Paris he worked as assistant to Danish painter Anton Melbye. He also studied paintings by other artists whose style impressed him: Courbet, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois Daubigny, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, and Corot. He also enrolled in various classes taught by masters, at schools such as \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts and Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. But Pissarro eventually found their teaching methods \"stifling,\" states art historian John Rewald. This prompted him to search for alternative instruction, which he requested and received from Corot.\nParis Salon and Corot's influence.\nHis initial paintings were in accord with the standards at the time to be displayed at the Paris Salon, the official body whose academic traditions dictated the kind of art that was acceptable. The Salon's annual exhibition was essentially the only marketplace for young artists to gain exposure. As a result, Pissarro worked in the traditional and prescribed manner to satisfy the tastes of its official committee.\nIn 1859 his first painting was accepted and exhibited. His other paintings during that period were influenced by Camille Corot, who tutored him. He and Corot both shared a love of rural scenes painted from nature. It was by Corot that Pissarro was inspired to paint outdoors, also called \"plein air\" painting. Pissarro found Corot, along with the work of Gustave Courbet, to be \"statements of pictorial truth,\" writes Rewald. He discussed their work often. Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet was another whose work he admired, especially his \"sentimental renditions of rural life\".\nUse of natural outdoor settings.\nDuring this period Pissarro began to understand and appreciate the importance of expressing on canvas the beauties of nature without adulteration. After a year in Paris, he therefore began to leave the city and paint scenes in the countryside to capture the daily reality of village life. He found the French countryside to be \"picturesque,\" and worthy of being painted. It was still mostly agricultural and sometimes called the \"golden age of the peasantry\". Pissarro later explained the technique of painting outdoors to a student:\n\"Work at the same time upon sky, water, branches, ground, keeping everything going on an equal basis and unceasingly rework until you have got it. Paint generously and unhesitatingly, for it is best not to lose the first impression.\"\nCorot would complete his paintings back in his studio, often revising them according to his preconceptions. Pissarro, however, preferred to finish his paintings outdoors, often at one sitting, which gave his work a more realistic feel. As a result, his art was sometimes criticised as being \"vulgar,\" because he painted what he saw: \"rutted and edged hodgepodge of bushes, mounds of earth, and trees in various stages of development.\" According to one source, such details were equivalent to today's art showing garbage cans or beer bottles on the side of a street. This difference in style created disagreements between Pissarro and Corot.\nWith Monet, C\u00e9zanne, and Guillaumin.\nIn 1859, while attending the free school, the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse, Pissarro became friends with a number of younger artists who likewise chose to paint in the more realistic style. Among them were Claude Monet, Armand Guillaumin and Paul C\u00e9zanne. What they shared in common was their dissatisfaction with the dictates of the Salon. C\u00e9zanne's work had been mocked at the time by the others in the school, and, writes Rewald, in his later years C\u00e9zanne \"never forgot the sympathy and understanding with which Pissarro encouraged him.\" As a part of the group, Pissarro was comforted from knowing he was not alone, and that others similarly struggled with their art.\nPissarro agreed with the group about the importance of portraying individuals in natural settings, and expressed his dislike of any artifice or grandeur in his works, despite what the Salon demanded for its exhibits. In 1863 almost all of the group's paintings were rejected by the Salon, and French Emperor Napoleon III instead decided to place their paintings in a separate exhibit hall, the Salon des Refus\u00e9s. However, only works of Pissarro and C\u00e9zanne were included, and the separate exhibit brought a hostile response from both the officials of the Salon and the public.\nIn subsequent Salon exhibits of 1865 and 1866, Pissarro acknowledged his influences from Melbye and Corot, whom he listed as his masters in the catalogue. But in the exhibition of 1868 he no longer credited other artists as an influence, in effect declaring his independence as a painter. This was noted at the time by art critic and author \u00c9mile Zola, who offered his opinion:\n\"Camille Pissarro is one of the three or four true painters of this day\u00a0... I have rarely encountered a technique that is so sure.\"\nAnother writer tries to describe elements of Pissarro's style:\n\"The brightness of his palette envelops objects in atmosphere\u00a0... He paints the smell of the earth.\"\nAnd though, on orders from the hanging Committee and the Marquis de Chennevi\u00e8res, Pissarro's paintings of Pontoise for example had been skyed, hung near the ceiling, this did not prevent Jules-Antoine Castagnary from noting that the qualities of his paintings had been observed by art lovers. At the age of thirty-eight, Pissarro had begun to win himself a reputation as a landscapist to rival Corot and Daubigny.\nIn the late 1860s or early 1870s, Pissarro became fascinated with Japanese prints, which influenced his desire to experiment in new compositions. He described the art to his son Lucien:\n\"It is marvelous. This is what I see in the art of this astonishing people\u00a0... nothing that leaps to the eye, a calm, a grandeur, an extraordinary unity, a rather subdued radiance\u00a0...\"\nMarriage and children.\nIn 1871 in Croydon, England, he married his mother's maid, Julie Vellay, a vineyard grower's daughter, with whom he had seven children, six of which would become painters: Lucien Pissarro (1863\u20131944), Georges Henri Manzana Pissarro (1871\u20131961), F\u00e9lix Pissarro (1874\u20131897), (1878\u20131952), (1881\u20131948), and Paul-\u00c9mile Pissarro (1884\u20131972). They lived outside Paris in Pontoise and later in Louveciennes, both of which places inspired many of his paintings including scenes of village life, along with rivers, woods, and people at work. He also kept in touch with the other artists of his earlier group, especially Monet, Renoir, C\u00e9zanne, and Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bazille.\nThe London years.\nAfter the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War of 1870\u201371, having only Danish nationality and being unable to join the army, he moved his family to Norwood, then a village on the edge of London. However, his style of painting, which was a forerunner of what was later called \"Impressionism\", did not do well. He wrote to his friend, Th\u00e9odore Duret, that \"my painting doesn't catch on, not at all\u00a0...\"\nPissarro met the Paris art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, in London, who became the dealer who helped sell his art for most of his life. Durand-Ruel put him in touch with Monet who was likewise in London during this period. They both viewed the work of British landscape artists John Constable and J. M. W. Turner, which confirmed their belief that their style of open air painting gave the truest depiction of light and atmosphere, an effect that they felt could not be achieved in the studio alone. Pissarro's paintings also began to take on a more spontaneous look, with loosely blended brushstrokes and areas of impasto, giving more depth to the work.\nPaintings.\nThrough the paintings Pissarro completed at this time, he records Sydenham and the Norwoods at a time when they were just recently connected by railways, but prior to the expansion of suburbia. One of the largest of these paintings is a view of \"St. Bartholomew's Church\" at Lawrie Park Avenue, commonly known as \"\", in the collection of the National Gallery in London. Twelve oil paintings date from his stay in Upper Norwood and are listed and illustrated in the catalogue raisonn\u00e9 prepared jointly by his fifth child Ludovic-Rodolphe Pissarro and Lionello Venturi and published in 1939. These paintings include \"Norwood Under the Snow\", and \"Lordship Lane Station\", views of The Crystal Palace relocated from Hyde Park, \"Dulwich College\", \"Sydenham Hill\", \"All Saints Church Upper Norwood\", and a lost painting of St. Stephen's Church.\nReturning to France, Pissarro lived in Pontoise from 1872 to 1884. In 1890 he again visited England and painted some ten scenes of central London. He came back again in 1892, painting in Kew Gardens and Kew Green, and also in 1897, when he produced several oils described as being of Bedford Park, Chiswick, but in fact all being of the nearby Stamford Brook area except for one of Bath Road, which runs from Stamford Brook along the south edge of Bedford Park.\nFrench Impressionism.\nWhen Pissarro returned to his home in France after the war, he discovered that of the 1,500 paintings he had done over 20 years, which he was forced to leave behind when he moved to London, only 40 remained. The rest had been damaged or destroyed by the soldiers, who often used them as floor mats outside in the mud to keep their boots clean. It is assumed that many of those lost were done in the Impressionist style he was then developing, thereby \"documenting the birth of Impressionism.\" Armand Silvestre, a critic, went so far as to call Pissarro \"basically the inventor of this [Impressionist] painting\"; however, Pissarro's role in the Impressionist movement was \"less that of the great man of ideas than that of the good counselor and appeaser\u00a0...\" \"Monet\u00a0... could be seen as the guiding force.\"\nHe soon reestablished his friendships with the other Impressionist artists of his earlier group, including C\u00e9zanne, Monet, Manet, Renoir, and Degas. Pissarro now expressed his opinion to the group that he wanted an alternative to the Salon so their group could display their own unique styles.\nTo assist in that endeavour, in 1873 he helped establish a separate collective, called the \"Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Anonyme des Artistes, Peintres, Sculpteurs et Graveurs,\" which included fifteen artists. Pissarro created the group's first charter and became the \"pivotal\" figure in establishing and holding the group together. One writer noted that with his prematurely grey beard, the forty-three-year-old Pissarro was regarded as a \"wise elder and father figure\" by the group. Yet he was able to work alongside the other artists on equal terms due to his youthful temperament and creativity. Another writer said of him that \"he has unchanging spiritual youth and the look of an ancestor who remained a young man\".\nImpressionist exhibitions that shocked the critics.\nThe following year, in 1874, the group held their first 'Impressionist' Exhibition, which shocked and \"horrified\" the critics, who primarily appreciated only scenes portraying religious, historical, or mythological settings. They found fault with the Impressionist paintings on many grounds:\nA \"revolutionary\" style.\nPissarro showed five of his paintings, all landscapes, at the exhibit, and again \u00c9mile Zola praised his art and that of the others. In the Impressionist exhibit of 1876, however, art critic Albert Wolff complained in his review, \"Try to make M. Pissarro understand that trees are not violet, that sky is not the color of fresh butter\u00a0...\" Journalist and art critic Octave Mirbeau on the other hand, writes, \"Camille Pissarro has been a revolutionary through the revitalized working methods with which he has endowed painting\".\nAccording to Rewald, Pissarro had taken on an attitude more simple and natural than the other artists. He writes:\n\"Rather than glorifying\u2014consciously or not\u2014the rugged existence of the peasants, he placed them without any 'pose' in their habitual surroundings, thus becoming an objective chronicler of one of the many facets of contemporary life.\"\nIn later years, C\u00e9zanne also recalled this period and referred to Pissarro as \"the first Impressionist\". In 1906, a few years after Pissarro's death, C\u00e9zanne, then 67 and a role model for the new generation of artists, paid Pissarro a debt of gratitude by having himself listed in an exhibition catalogue as \"Paul C\u00e9zanne, pupil of Pissarro\".\nPissarro, Degas, and American impressionist Mary Cassatt planned a journal of their original prints in the late 1870s, a project that nevertheless came to nothing when Degas withdrew. Art historian and the artist's great-grandson Joachim Pissarro notes that they \"professed a passionate disdain for the Salons and refused to exhibit at them.\" Together they shared an \"almost militant resolution\" against the Salon, and through their later correspondences it is clear that their mutual admiration \"was based on a kinship of ethical as well as aesthetic concerns\".\nCassatt had befriended Degas and Pissarro years earlier when she joined Pissarro's newly formed French Impressionist group and gave up opportunities to exhibit in the United States. She and Pissarro were often treated as \"two outsiders\" by the Salon since neither were French or had become French citizens. However, she was \"fired up with the cause\" of promoting Impressionism and looked forward to exhibiting \"out of solidarity with her new friends\". Towards the end of the 1890s she began to distance herself from the Impressionists, avoiding Degas at times as she did not have the strength to defend herself against his \"wicked tongue\". Instead, she came to prefer the company of \"the gentle Camille Pissarro\", with whom she could speak frankly about the changing attitudes toward art. She once described him as a teacher \"that could have taught the stones to draw correctly.\"\nNeo-Impressionist period.\nBy the 1880s, Pissarro began to explore new themes and methods of painting to break out of what he felt was an artistic \"mire\". As a result, Pissarro went back to his earlier themes by painting the life of country people, which he had done in Venezuela in his youth. Degas described Pissarro's subjects as \"peasants working to make a living\".\nHowever, this period also marked the end of the Impressionist period due to Pissarro's leaving the movement. As Joachim Pissarro points out:\n\"Once such a die-hard Impressionist as Pissarro had turned his back on Impressionism, it was apparent that Impressionism had no chance of surviving\u00a0...\"\nIt was Pissarro's intention during this period to help \"educate the public\" by painting people at work or at home in realistic settings, without idealising their lives. Pierre-Auguste Renoir, in 1882, referred to Pissarro's work during this period as \"revolutionary,\" in his attempt to portray the \"common man.\" Pissarro himself did not use his art to overtly preach any kind of political message, however, although his preference for painting humble subjects was intended to be seen and purchased by his upper class clientele. He also began painting with a more unified brushwork along with pure strokes of color.\nStudying with Seurat and Signac.\nIn 1885 he met Georges Seurat and Paul Signac, both of whom relied on a more \"scientific\" theory of painting by using very small patches of pure colours to create the illusion of blended colours and shading when viewed from a distance. Pissarro then spent the years from 1885 to 1888 practising this more time-consuming and laborious technique, referred to as pointillism. The paintings that resulted were distinctly different from his Impressionist works, and were on display in the 1886 Impressionist Exhibition, but under a separate section, along with works by Seurat, Signac, and his son Lucien.\nAll four works were considered an \"exception\" to the eighth exhibition. Joachim Pissarro notes that virtually every reviewer who commented on Pissarro's work noted \"his extraordinary capacity to change his art, revise his position and take on new challenges.\" One critic writes:\n\"It is difficult to speak of Camille Pissarro\u00a0... What we have here is a fighter from way back, a master who continually grows and courageously adapts to new theories.\"\nPissarro explained the new art form as a \"phase in the logical march of Impressionism\", but he was alone among the other Impressionists with this attitude, however. Joachim Pissarro states that Pissarro thereby became the \"only artist who went from Impressionism to Neo-Impressionism\".\nIn 1884, art dealer Theo van Gogh asked Pissarro if he would take in his older brother, Vincent, as a boarder in his home. Lucien Pissarro wrote that his father was impressed by Van Gogh's work and had \"foreseen the power of this artist\", who was 23 years younger. Although Van Gogh never boarded with him, Pissarro did explain to him the various ways of finding and expressing light and color, ideas which he later used in his paintings, notes Lucien.\nAbandoning Neo-Impressionism.\nPissarro eventually turned away from Neo-Impressionism, claiming its system was too artificial. He explains in a letter to a friend:\n\"Having tried this theory for four years and having then abandoned it\u00a0... I can no longer consider myself one of the neo-impressionists\u00a0... It was impossible to be true to my sensations and consequently to render life and movement, impossible to be faithful to the effects, so random and so admirable, of nature, impossible to give an individual character to my drawing, [that] I had to give up.\"\nHowever, after reverting to his earlier style, his work became, according to Rewald, \"more subtle, his color scheme more refined, his drawing firmer\u00a0... So it was that Pissarro approached old age with an increased mastery.\"\nBut the change also added to Pissarro's continual financial hardship which he felt until his 60s. His \"headstrong courage and a tenacity to undertake and sustain the career of an artist\", writes Joachim Pissarro, was due to his \"lack of fear of the immediate repercussions\" of his stylistic decisions. In addition, his work was strong enough to \"bolster his morale and keep him going\", he writes. His Impressionist contemporaries, however, continued to view his independence as a \"mark of integrity\", and they turned to him for advice, referring to him as \"P\u00e8re Pissarro\" (father Pissarro).\nLater years.\nIn his older age Pissarro suffered from a recurring eye infection that prevented him from working outdoors except in warm weather. As a result of this disability, he began painting outdoor scenes while sitting by the window of hotel rooms. He often chose hotel rooms on upper levels to get a broader view. He moved around northern France and painted from hotels in Rouen, Paris, Le Havre and Dieppe. On his visits to London, he would do the same.\nPissarro died in Paris on 13 November 1903 and was buried in P\u00e8re Lachaise Cemetery.\nLegacy and influence.\nDuring the period Pissarro exhibited his works, art critic Armand Silvestre had called Pissarro the \"most real and most naive member\" of the Impressionist group. His work has also been described by art historian Diane Kelder as expressing \"the same quiet dignity, sincerity, and durability that distinguished his person.\" She adds that \"no member of the group did more to mediate the internecine disputes that threatened at times to break it apart, and no one was a more diligent proselytizer of the new painting.\"\nAccording to Pissarro's son, Lucien, his father painted regularly with C\u00e9zanne beginning in 1872. He recalls that C\u00e9zanne walked a few miles to join Pissarro at various settings in Pontoise. While they shared ideas during their work, the younger C\u00e9zanne wanted to study the countryside through Pissarro's eyes, as he admired Pissarro's landscapes from the 1860s. C\u00e9zanne, although only nine years younger than Pissarro, said that \"he was a father for me. A man to consult and a little like the good Lord.\"\nLucien Pissarro was taught painting by his father, and described him as a \"splendid teacher, never imposing his personality on his pupil.\" Gauguin, who also studied under him, referred to Pissarro \"as a force with which future artists would have to reckon\". Art historian Diane Kelder notes that it was Pissarro who introduced Gauguin, who was then a young stockbroker studying to become an artist, to Degas and C\u00e9zanne. Gauguin, near the end of his career, wrote a letter to a friend in 1902, shortly before Pissarro's death:\n\"If we observe the totality of Pissarro's work, we find there, despite fluctuations, not only an extreme artistic will, never belied, but also an essentially intuitive, purebred art\u00a0... He was one of my masters and I do not deny him.\"\nThe American impressionist Mary Cassatt, who at one point lived in Paris to study art, and joined his Impressionist group, noted that he was \"such a teacher that he could have taught the stones to draw correctly.\"\nCaribbean author and scholar Derek Walcott based his book-length poem, \"Tiepolo's Hound\" (2000), on Pissarro's life.\nThe legacy of Nazi-looted Pissarros.\nDuring the early 1930s throughout Europe, Jewish owners of numerous fine art masterpieces found themselves forced to give up or sell off their collections for minimal prices due to anti-Jewish laws created by the new Nazi regime. Many Jews were forced to flee Germany starting in 1933, and then, as the Nazis expanded their hold over all of Europe, Austria, France, Holland, Poland, Italy and other countries. The Nazis created special looting organizations like the Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce whose mission it was to seize Jewish property notably valuable artworks. When those forced into exile or deported to extermination camps owned valuables, including artwork, they were often sold to finance the Nazi war effort, sent to Hitler's personal museum, traded or seized by officials for personal gain. Several artworks by Pissarro were looted from their Jewish owners in Germany, France and elsewhere by the Nazis.\nPissarro's \"Shepherdess Bringing Home the Sheep\" (La Berg\u00e8re Rentrant des Moutons\") was looted from the Jewish art collectors Yvonne et Raoul Meyer in France in 1941 and transited via Switzerland and New York before entering the Fred Jones Jr Museum at the University of Oklahoma. In 2014, Meyer's daughter, L\u00e9onie-No\u00eblle Meyer filed a restitution claim which resulted in years of court battle. The lawsuit resulted in the recognition of Meyer's ownership and its transfer to France for five years, coupled with an agreement to shuttle the painting back and forth between Paris and Oklahoma every three years after that. However, in 2020 Meyer filed suit in a French court to challenge the accord. After Fred Jones Jr Museum sued Meyer requesting heavy financial penalties, the Holocaust survivor abandoned her effort to recover the Pissarro, saying, \"I have no other choice.\nPissarro's Picking Peas (La Cueillette) was looted from Jewish businessman Simon Bauer, in addition to 92 other artworks seized in 1943 by the Vichy collaborationist regime in France.\nPissarro's \"Sower And Ploughman,\" was owned by Dr Henri Hinrichsen, a Jewish music publisher from Leipzig, until 11 January 1940, when he was forced to relinquish the painting to Hildebrand Gurlitt in Nazi-occupied Brussels, before being murdered in Auschwitz in September 1942.\nPissarro's \u201cLe Quai Malaquais, Printemps\u201d, owned by German Jewish publisher Samuel Fischer, founder of the famous S. Fischer Verlag, passed through the hands of infamous Nazi art looter Bruno Lohse.\nPissarro's \"Le Boulevard de Montmartre, Matin\u00e9e de Printemps\", owned by Max Silberberg, a German Jewish industrialist whose renowned art collection was considered \"one of the best in pre-war Germany\", was seized and sold in a forced auction before Silberberg and his wife Johanna were murdered in Auschwitz.\nIn the decades after World War II, many art masterpieces were found on display in various galleries and museums in Europe and the United States, often with false provenances and labels missing. Some, as a result of legal action, were later returned to the families of the original owners. Many of the recovered paintings were then donated to the same or other museums as a gift.\nOne such lost piece, Pissarro's 1897 oil painting, \"Rue St. Honor\u00e9, Apres Midi, Effet de Pluie\", was discovered hanging at Madrid's government-owned museum, the Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza. In January 2011 the Spanish government denied a request by the US ambassador to return the painting. At the subsequent trial in Los Angeles, the court ruled that the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection Foundation was the rightful owner. In 1999, Pissarro's 1897 \"Le Boulevard de Montmartre, Matin\u00e9e de Printemps\" appeared in the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, its donor having been unaware of its pre-war provenance. In January 2012, \"Le March\u00e9 aux Poissons\" (The Fish Market), a color monotype, was returned after 30 years.\nDuring his lifetime, Camille Pissarro sold few of his paintings. By the 21st century, however, his paintings were selling for millions. An auction record for the artist was set on 6 November 2007 at Christie's in New York, where a group of four paintings, \"Les Quatre Saisons\" (the Four Seasons), sold for $14,601,000 (estimate $12,000,000 \u2013 $18,000,000). In November 2009 \"Le Pont Boieldieu et la Gare d'Orl\u00e9ans, Rouen, Soleil\" sold for $7,026,500 at Sotheby's in New York.\nIn February 2014 the 1897 \"Le Boulevard de Montmartre, Matin\u00e9e de Printemps\", originally owned by the German industrialist and Holocaust victim Max Silberberg (), sold at Sotheby's in London for \u00a319.9M, nearly five times the previous record.\nIn October 2021 Berlin's Alte Nationalgalerie restituted Pissarro's \"A Square in La Roche-Guyon\" (1867) to the heirs of Armand Dorville, a French Jewish art collector whose family was persecuted by the Nazis and whose paintings had been sold at a 1942 auction in Nice that was overseen by the Commissariat G\u00e9n\u00e9ral aux Questions Juives. The museum then purchased the Pissarro back.\nA family of painters.\nCamille's son Lucien was an Impressionist and Neo-impressionist painter as were his second and third sons Georges Henri Manzana Pissarro and F\u00e9lix Pissarro. Lucien's daughter Orovida Pissarro was also a painter. Camille's great-grandson, Joachim Pissarro, became Head Curator of Drawing and Painting at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and a professor in Hunter College's Art Department. Camille's great-granddaughter, L\u00e9lia Pissarro, has had her work exhibited alongside her great-grandfather. Another great-granddaughter, Julia Pissarro, a Barnard College graduate, is also active in the art scene. From the only daughter of Camille, Jeanne Pissarro, other painters include Henri Bonin-Pissarro (1918\u20132003) and Claude Bonin-Pissarro (born 1921), who is the father of the Abstract artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bonin-Pissarro (born 1964).\nFurther reading.\n\"Critical Catalogue of Paintings\".\nIn June 2006, a three-volume work of 1,500 pages was published, titled \"Pissarro: Critical Catalogue of Paintings\". It was compiled by Joachim Pissarro, descendant of the painter, and Claire Durand-Ruel Snollaerts, descendant of the French art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. The work is the most comprehensive collection of Pissarro paintings to date. It contains accompanying images of drawings and studies, as well as photographs of Pissarro and his family that had not previously been published."}
{"title": "Deimantas_Narkevi\u010dius", "label": "Artist", "text": "Deimantas Narkevi\u010dius (born 24 May 1964 in Utena, Lithuanian SSR) is one of the most consistent and widely recognised Lithuanian artists on the international art scene. Originally trained as a sculptor, Narkevi\u010dius has mainly been working with film and video.&lt;ref name=\"gbagency Biography/presentation\"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Employing documentary footage, voice-overs, interviews, re-enactments and found photographs, his films submit historical events to the narrative structures of storytelling and cinema. In his artistic practice Narkevi\u010dius examines the relationship of personal memories to political histories, particularly those of his native Lithuania. For the artist history, itself has become both material and methodology.\nSince 1992 Narkevi\u010dius has exhibited extensively around the world at some important contemporary art venues and events including Centre Pompidou (Paris), Museo Nacional Centro De Arte Reina Sofia (Madrid), Tate Modern (London), Museum of Modern Art (New York), Stedelijk Museum (Amsterdam). He represented Lithuania at the 49th Venice Biennale in 2001 and two years later exhibited at the 50th Venice Biennale in \"Utopia Station\" curated by Molly Nesbit and Hans Ulrich Obrist. Narkevi\u010dius's work was shown at Manifesta II (Luxembourg, 1998) and Manifesta X (St. Petersburg, 2014). Amongst his most recent solo shows are \"20 July.2015\" at Maureen Paley (London, 2017), \"Books on Shelves and Without Letters\" at The Blank Contemporary Art (Bergamo, 2016), \"Archeology of Memories\" at former KGB building (Riga, 2015). Narkevi\u010dius's major retrospective opens at the National Gallery of Art in Vilnius, Lithuania, in December 2017.\nNarkevi\u010dius's works are a part of major private and public collections such as Tate Modern (London), Moderna Museet (Stockholm), Modern Art Museum (Vilnius). In 2008 for his achievements in art Narkevi\u010dius has been awarded the Vincent Award and the Lithuanian National Prize for Culture and Arts. His film \"Restricted Sensation\" (2011) was a nominee for the best short feature at the 2012 Silver Crane film awards.\nDeimantas Narkevi\u010dius lives and works in Vilnius, Lithuania.\nBiography.\nChildhood in Utena.\nDeimantas Narkevi\u010dius was born in Utena, Lithuania, in 1964 at the time when Lithuania was part of the Soviet Union.\nIn several interviews such as in the one from 2003 with curator Hans Ulrich Obrist Narkevi\u010dius reflected on the importance of films he saw in his early childhood. His first experience of cinema was watching movies with his parents in the theatre or at home on television. Films by prominent Soviet directors such as Sergei Eisenstein, in particular, his \"Ivan Grozny, Part II\" (1958) which he saw at the age of five, and \"Bronenosec Potiomkin\" (1925), were among his earliest cinematic experiences that in Narkevi\u010dius's own words had a dramatic impact on him.\nLater in his early adolescence Narkevi\u010dius familiarised with the cinema of his time even further by seeing Sergei Parajanov's \"Hakob Hovnatanyan\" (1967) which again had a significant impact on the young artist. It was then that he became fascinated with the films produced in the studios of the Soviet republics, which revealed local identities, traditions and languages. In another interview from 2011 Narkevi\u010dius described technological and stylistic aspects of Parajanov's film that moved him as a young person:\nGrowing up Narkevi\u010dius was often ill which meant he had to stay at home. As a result, he spent a considerable amount of time watching Soviet television. The documentary material on the 16mm film that used to be on TV in the 1970s made an impression on Narkevi\u010dius who later used the same type of film extensively in his artistic practice. Interviews were filmed with 16mm cameras, and then they were processed and made ready for the evening news on the same day. Since they were done in quite a rush, it provoked considerable experimentation. These films were screened and then broadcast, raising a range of possibilities for using film. Narkevi\u010dius who grew familiar with these images admitted to the ingenuity of their production and the effect it had on him even after many years: \"I sometimes look back at them, and I see how creative they were \u2013 how creative the camerawork and the editing was\".\nThe early influences of cinema and television describe Narkevi\u010dius's artistic style and means of production. They can potentially be seen as a factor that affected his decision of selecting filmmaking as opposed to object making early in his career. The history and context of the Soviet Union in which these early experiences were produced had become the principal subject of Narkevi\u010dius's oeuvre.\nStudent years in Vilnius and London.\nAt the age of fourteen Narkevi\u010dius was sent to Vilnius by his parents to study in the art boarding school where he matured surrounded by students who came from similar backgrounds. According to the artist, during this period, still in the Soviet Union, everything was quite impersonal, and at the beginning of his artistic career, he was trying to personalise what he was doing to motivate himself. Artists at that time were seen as advertisers of the regime \u2013 which compared with post-war Stalinism was relatively liberal. However, the primary purpose of artists still was to provide an ideological service, he or she always had to be prepared for it.\nAfter finishing secondary school, at the age eighteen, for a year and a half Narkevi\u010dius worked in a museum that exhibited a collection of Soviet art. In an interview with Melissa Gronlund, he admitted that he was amazed at how funny those artworks were to him. Later in 1987 Narkevi\u010dius enrolled in Vilnius Art Institute (now Vilnius Academy of Arts) where he chose to study sculpture. The academy's curriculum was rigid and didn't excite him as much as he would have expected. In his own words, prominent Lithuanian expatriate artists Jonas Mekas and George Ma\u010di\u016bnas meant more to him than any teacher he had at that time.\nBetween 1992 and 1993, while still a member of the Vilnius Academy of Arts, Narkevi\u010dius lived in London, UK. In England, he was exploring possibilities of object making and approaching the medium from a conceptual standpoint. London was an exciting place to be for the emerging artist. This period which was marked by intensive learning had a significant impact for Narkevi\u010dius's understanding of contemporary art as he got exposed to London's art milieu, for example, artists of the YBA generation, but more so for his motivation for becoming an artist. A dense concentration of artists and a competitive artistic climate meant that the standards for art were set high, but it also led to a strong community sense. Artists were often collaborating and helping each other in different ways. Narkevi\u010dius who was one of them was able to benefit from these processes.\nAfter his return from London Narkevi\u010dius was interested in site-specific objects and continued producing sculptural works. However, after a short while, he realised that he was leaning towards the storytelling and felt that he needed to find a better media for that. As a result, he began recording interviews with people from his environment. For the emerging artist, it proved to be a perfect medium for developing narratives as well as for exploring sound and visual language.\nFilm career.\nSince the late 90s, Narkevi\u010dius worked mostly in film and video, experimenting with the film structure and thematising the weight of individual memories and personal revisions of history. The majority of his films deal extensively with the cultural legacy of Communism, and attempts to erase it after the fall of the Warsaw Pact regimes in 1989 and the collapse of the Soviet Union two years later, with an emphasis on statues, sculptors, artists and moving images. These themes first emerged in his early films \"Europa, 54\u00b0 54' \u2013 25\u00b0 19\" (1997), \"Legend Coming True\" (1999), and \"Energy Lithuania\" (2000). A 7-minute 35mm film \"His-story\" (1998) shown at Manifesta II in 1998 gained the artist international recognition making Narkevi\u010dius into one of the leading contemporary filmmakers of the Eastern European region.\nIn 2001, Narkevi\u010dius represented Lithuania at the 49th Venice Biennale. Two years later he came back to Venice to show his work in the \"Utopia Station\" curated by Molly Nesbit and Hans Ulrich Obrist. Describing his work's relationship with his nation's past in an interview with Obrist, Narkevi\u010dius said that, \"Memory is a funny thing. I think our brain has a filter: you remember what you want to remember. And you recreate the stories of the memory in a way that you want to remember them and how you would like to create them\".\nIn perhaps his best-known film \"The Role of a Lifetime\" (2003), commissioned by UK-based organisation Art and Sacred Places for a parish church in Brighton, Narkevi\u010dius asked what it meant to be a filmmaker with a social conscience. The centrepiece of the film is an interview with British director Peter Watkins whose politically-charged, fictionalised documentary-style works had addressed the Hungarian uprising, \"The Battle of Culloden\" (1964), and the \"La Commune (Paris, 1871)\" (2000), and who had left the UK in frustration at censorship and neglect settling in Vilnius. The interview is juxtaposed with 1960s Super-8 footage of Brighton &amp; Hove, and sketches by Lithuanian artist Mindaugas Luko\u0161aitis of Gr\u016btas Park, the sculpture garden 80 miles south of Vilnius where many of the country's Soviet monuments ended up after the fall of the Soviet Union. Noting that some people considered the decision to save the statues \"a disaster\", Watkins described the park as a place to contemplate \"man's unbelievable folly and inhumanity ... and sadly, the endless repetition of history\".\nNarkevi\u010dius's next film, \"Once in the XX Century\" (2004) played with the Lithuanian television footage, that was broadcast across the world, of the statue of Lenin being torn down in Vilnius's Luki\u0161k\u0117s Square in 1991. Recutting it in reverse, Narkevi\u010dius showed a jubilant crowd cheering the monument as it was hoisted from the back of a vehicle onto a plinth, being reunited with its legs. In \"Once in the XX Century\" he continued to explore and contextualise the problematics of public monument and monumentality \u2013 a central theme in Narkevi\u010dius's artistic practice.\n\"The Head\" (2007) consisted entirely of photographs and archival footage made for East German television. The film documents the creation of the world's second-largest head sculpture \u2013 a seven-metre-high profile of Karl Marx by Soviet socialist-realist Lev Kerbel (1917\u20132003) \u2013 from its conception in 1968 to its unveiling in Karl-Marx Stadt (now Chemnitz) in 1971. Narkevi\u010dius commented on his film by saying: \"Objects from that period are not a crime. They are rather testimonies to historical crimes, visual heritage of an era to be kept and appreciated: if we want to feel any compassion for what the people who lived then lost, and in order to separate individuals from their creatively inhibited artworks \u2013 even if the consequences of this aesthetical repression can still be felt in the Eastern Bloc ...\".\nFor \"Revisiting Solaris\" (2007) Narkevi\u010dius adapted the final chapter of Stanis\u0142aw Lem's novel \"Solaris\" (1961), which Andrei Tarkovsky left out in his 1972 film. In Narkevi\u010dius's film Lithuanian actor Donatas Banionis reprised his role as Chris Kelvin after more than 30 years. In \"Revisiting Solaris\" Narkevi\u010dius used a series of photographs taken by prominent Lithuanian symbolist painter Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis in Anapa (now Russia) in 1905 to represent the foreign planet, as well as Eduard Artemyev's iconic score from the original film. \"Revisiting Solaris\" marked an outstanding interdisciplinary effort by the Lithuanian filmmaker to join multiple talents from different periods making it into a timeless monument.\n\"Restricted Sensation\" (2011) was Narkevi\u010dius first long feature that was shown in cinemas. A 45-minute length film depicts the abuse of a talented young gay theatre director in the Lithuanian SSR in the 1970s, with the post-Stalinist re-criminalisation of homosexuality representing the oppressive cultural policy that took hold as Stalin assumed total power in the late 1920s. Although it can be read as a comment both on that period's homophobia and Vladimir Putin's current persecution of Russia's LGBTQI population, Narkevi\u010dius said he was not aiming to depict the explicit, illegal life of gays in the Soviet Union. Rather, the film comments on \"the distrust and intolerance of what is perceived as foreign to a particular country\u2019s culture\" and was \"an attempt to identify the causes of the increasing prevalence of intolerance\".\nHis most recent work, \"20 July.2015\" (2016), traces the removal of several socialist realist sculptures from the Green Bridge in central Vilnius, Lithuania, which had been erected in 1952. Presented in immersive 3D \u2013 Narkevi\u010dius's first use of the medium \u2013 it culminates in the final removal of the monuments at 2 a.m. on 20 July 2015.\nArtistic work.\n\"The Role of a Lifetime\".\nDeimantas Narkevi\u010dius\nLithuania, 2003\n17 minutes, Colour/B&amp;W, Stereo, 4:3\nOriginal format: 8mm, Super 8mm and 35mm film\nIt is perhaps \"The Role of a Lifetime\" (2003) that most evocatively and thoughtfully ties together Narkevi\u010dius's interests in the uncertainties at the heart of post-Soviet Lithuania with the implications of his own work in creating film and video. The film combines three distinct elements. The first one is an interview with the British filmmaker Peter Watkins that Narkevi\u010dius recorded in Lithuania. Known for his pioneering docudrama films \"Culloden\" (1964) and \"The War Game\" (1965), which politicised and fictionalised the documentary form, Watkins lived in Vilnius for many years in the course of his self-imposed exile from Britain. The second is a sequence of drawings of the Lithuanian landscape by Lithuanian artist Mindaugas Luko\u0161aitis. A number of these drawing show Gr\u016bto Park, a kind of Soviet theme park in the south of Lithuania, that acts as a repository of Social Realist sculptures from the post-war era. The third is a footage of Brighton life shot by an amateur film enthusiast Geoffrey Cook which Narkevi\u010dius found in archives in Brighton.\nIn works like \"Punishment Park\" (1970) or \"La Commune (Paris 1871)\" (2000), Watkins has challenged what he calls the \"monoform\": cinematographic editing that reduces disparate visual and acoustic parts to a narrative whole. Narkevi\u010dius undoes the monoform by putting together images and sounds that do not match each other in what appears to be a biographical documentary. The film scenes are too idyllic and too recent for the traumatic World War II childhood that Watkins recollects; a summer hum of birds and insects accompanies his description of the Soviet monuments collected in Gr\u016bto, and the pencil sketches of the park show a thick layer of snow covering the defunct socialist heroes. Maybe the wizened man in the stills is not Watkins but the protagonist of yet another history.\nMore dialogical than monological, \"The Role of a Lifetime\" ends up highlighting distinct bodies of work and visions: Narkevi\u010dius's audio interviews with Watkins, drawings by Mindaugas Luko\u0161aitis (filmed by Audrius Keme\u017eys, who catches Luko\u0161aitis's hand), and archival footage of Brighton filmed by Geoffrey Cook in the 1960s. In his role as a master editor, Narkevi\u010dius mismatches these silent images and invisible sounds not only to question documentary's veracity but also to begin that elusive discussion with the audience, who must put parts together. Experiencing the gap between Watkin's eloquent remarks on creativity and Cook's quirky views of Brighton comes close to participant observation. Cook's Brighton initially appears to be part of Watkin's childhood memories, only to emerge as the eye of yet another filmmaker; in this shift, the cathartic hit of nostalgia, instantly delivered by Super 8, dissolves into two visions of the past, whose incommensurability makes them all the more fascinating.\nAs in other works, in \"The Role of a Lifetime\", it is Narkevi\u010dius's editing of the quotidian and the unmonumental qualities of everyday life that complicate the material and bring it into dialogue with the misplaced authoritarianism of the dead monuments. Watkins's attention to reinterpreting history and continually bringing it into dialogue with the present-day \u2013 resistance to pushing the past away out of sight and mind \u2013 is mirrored in the dystopic/utopic space of the sculpture park, neither alive, nor dead, but fully both. As rendered by Narkevi\u010dius the space represents the indigestible qualities of these objects, burdened by their role as icons of a past regime. Both Watkins and Narkevi\u010dius share a profound scepticism about images that promise to be authentic representations of history. Independently of each other they have produced films with similar concerns: dismantling the conventional visual rhetoric of historic testimony and searching for a cinematic language that does not subject the history to the forces of ideological assimilation or mass media commodification.\n\"Once in the XX Century\".\nDeimantas Narkevi\u010dius\nLithuania, 2004\n7 minutes, 56 seconds, Colour, Stereo, 4:3\nOriginal format: Betacam SP video\n\"Once in the XX Century\" (2004) is based on video documentation of the removal of a monumental public sculpture of Lenin from Luki\u0161ki\u0173 Square in Lithuania in 1991. The artist acquired footage from the Lithuanian National TV archive and a freelance video reporter to have a two-camera perspective on the event. These images of the figure hanging above the crowd with his hand raised have been broadcast hundreds of times by CNN and other news channels over the last decades as a symbol of the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the failure of Communism.\nIn Deimantas Narkevi\u010dius's video, Lenin's ghost statue is reinstalled. Recutting the action in reverse, Narkevi\u010dius shows a violently enthusiastic crowd cheering a statue as it is paraded on the back of a vehicle, and raised into the air to then swing uncannily into place, as Lenin is seamlessly reunited with his legs. The demise of Eastern European socialist regimes at the end of the twentieth century led to the removal of many such monuments, taken down by either the state or the people themselves in hope for a better future. For many, this hope has not been fulfilled. Narkevi\u010dius's historical reversal ironically points to the repetition of scenes in history and talks about the longing for or denial of political and economic systems.\n\"Once in the XX Century\" throws into relief the absurdity of the scene as a potential event \u2013 the public barely ever gets as wild about installing authority as it does about dismantling it. However, the video also reveals a moment of breakage in the country's history, mirrored in the ruin-image of a pair of calves and feet stranded on a plinth with no body or head. Moments of dramatic political violently break the future open, to reveal an unnervingly undefined limbo. However, a violent break with the past such as this \u2013 when it is open season on the symbols of the powers just ousted \u2013 is also a moment of groundless suspension.\nIn 2005 \"Flash Art\" used an image of the figure of Lenin from Narkevi\u010dius film to promote the 2nd Prague Biennale (2005). The description mistakenly said it was the statue of Lenin being removed from Kaluzhskaya Square (former October Square) in Moscow, Russia. In reality, Lenin statue is still in Kaluzhskaya Square.\n\"Revisiting Solaris\".\nDeimantas Narkevi\u010dius\nLithuania, 2007\n18 minutes, Colour/B&amp;W, Stereo, 16:9\nOriginal format: 35mm film\nNarkevi\u010dius first saw Andrej Tarkovsky's film in the 1970s. In an interview with Larissa Harris he admitted that then, when he was about sixteen or seventeen, he did not get it at all, simply not understanding what was going on in the film. Nevertheless, it engaged him and raised his curiosity. Later on Narkevi\u010dius watched \"Solaris\" over and over again. \"I kept watching it until, having reached my thirties, I finally liked it a lot. Perhaps that was also due to the fact that I started to lose people who were close to me\".\nOut of Tarkovsky's film language, Lem's book, photographs by Mikalojus Konstantinas \u010ciurlionis, and Donatas Banionis Narkevi\u010dius made another \"Solaris\". In the same conversation, Narkevi\u010dius stressed the fact that within his film he meets Chris Kelvin and not Donatas Banionis. \"Revisiting Solaris\" is in a way an extension of the Tarkovsky's film, many years later. Donatas Banionis who initially was not so keen on reprising his role did not have any reflection on his role in Narkevi\u010dius's film and did not make any comments on the old film either, according to the artist he simply \"is\" Chris Kelvin again.\nIn \"Solaris\", before Donatas Banionis as Chris Kelvin leaves Earth, the old pilot Burton attacks him as \"not fit to go into space\" and \"an accountant, not a scientist\". In \"Revisiting Solaris\", Banionis/Kelvin and an unnamed woman who is played by Narkevi\u010dius's wife say these words to the artist who in such a way himself becomes young Chris Kelvin. The difference between Tarkovsky's and Narkevi\u010dius's versions of the scene is that take-off does not happen. The image of the planet Solaris is represented as Banionis/Kelvin's memories. The mysterious planet is revisited by evoking both the memories of a man who was \"there\" some time ago and also viewers' collective memories of the Tarkovsky's film. \"There\" happened in the form of a fiction film in 1972, but Narkevi\u010dius accepts it as reality.\nAs with his other work, Narkevi\u010dius is awaking something anachronistic, something that has gone from our every-day (or contemporary media) experience. By bringing a real man, a witness to an outstanding cinematographic achievement like \"Solaris\" by A. Tarkovsky, he emphasises that some dimensions of the film remain relevant. The presence of D. Banionis is also a link between \"then\" and \"now\", between created reality and its impact on a viewer many years later. \"The man is among us, the way he moves is the same, his look is the same, so 1972 is still 'present'.\u201d\nMost of the selected locations seen in \"Revisiting Solaris\" are functional architecture from the period of radical modernisation. They are linked with the recent past, which for Narkevi\u010dius was very much about creating a future. In comparison, in \"Solaris\", the future is represented by the beautiful shots of the roads and highways Tarkovsky took in Tokyo in 1970. Narkevi\u010dius chose the locations for Banionis to discover them. When talking to L. Harris, he said that he wanted him to establish contact with those spaces, accommodate them with his presence while being filmed. The room with two telephones, for example, is a former KGB prison, now the Museum of Genocide Victims in Vilnius where decades ago people were killed for political reasons. For that scene, Narkevi\u010dius chose an excerpt from Lem's book that talks about the nature of human thoughts. \"What potential dangers can result from materialisation of some thoughts? What \"phantoms\" were generated by human minds in recent history?\u201d Narkevi\u010dius rhetorically asks the viewers of his film.\nObjects.\nAlthough Deimantas Narkevi\u010dius is primarily known for his cinematographic work, he started his career working with sculpture and found objects. Narkevi\u010dius's aim to personalise the relationship between the artist and his work emerged during his study years in Vilnius Academy of Arts, as also did his search for a means of expression matching the conceptual idea. It prompted him to embrace the avant-garde tradition and the principles of site-specific art. At that stage, he sought to cast off the dominant romantic concept of art and actualise other principles of visual expression that would directly and didactically reflect the thinking of the artist. His one-year stay in London was crucial in this regard because it was there that he introduced ready-made into his artistic practice.\nNarkevi\u010dius's sculptures actively question preconceptions regarding day-to-day objects, assigning them new and indeterminate functions. He builds his creative platform by siting them in the historical context of the environment they belong to. In such a way Narkevi\u010dius creates a new semantic field to communicate his ideas via the physical form.\nThe work \"Too Long on a Pedestal\" was made in 1994, when the Lithuanian public was still affected by the huge political and social shifts of the early 1990s. The stagnant and morally compromised ideological system that had dominated social life for nearly 50 years was being replaced by a new one. This work, tinged with subtle humour, is a reflection on how the heritage of the political system becomes history. The means of expression selected by the artist, a pair of worn-out classic-style shoes, now filled with coarse salt, points to the statues of heroes that used to embody the value system of the former epoch, but the people promptly removed them from their pedestals, as politics changed its course.\nFilmography.\n\"Europa, 54\u00b0 54' \u2013 25\u00b0 19\"' (1997)\n\"His-story\" (1998)\n\"Mass for the Truth of Blacksmith Ignotas\" (1998)\n\"Legend Coming True\" (1999)\n\"Energy Lithuania\" (2000)\n\"Kamietis (Countryman)\" (2002)\n\"Role of a Lifetime\" (2003)\n\"Scena\" (2003)\n\"Once in the XX Century\" (2004)\n\"Disappearance of a Tribe\" (2005)\n\"Matrio\u0161kos\" (2005)\n\"The Head\" (2007)\n\"Revisiting Solaris\" (2007)\n\"The Dud Effect\" (2008)\n\"Into the Unknown\" (2009)\n\"Ausgetr\u00e4umt\" (2010)\n\"Restricted Sensation\" (2011)\n\"Books on Shelves and Without Letters\" (2013)\n\"20.July 2015\" (2016)\nSolo exhibitions.\n2017\n\"Deimantas Narkevi\u010dius, 20 JULY.2015\", Maureen Paley, London.\n2016\n\"Doubled Youth\", Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead.\n\"Medialization of Monuments;

{"title": "Caspar_David_Friedrich", "label": "Artist", "text": "Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 \u2013 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes, which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic ruins. His primary interest was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\".\nFriedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\".\nFriedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \"the tragedy of landscape\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his paintings in Berlin. By the 1920s his paintings had been discovered by the Expressionists, and in the 1930s and early 1940s Surrealists and Existentialists frequently drew ideas from his work. The rise of Nazism in the early 1930s again saw a resurgence in Friedrich's popularity, but this was followed by a sharp decline as his paintings were, by association with the Nazi movement, interpreted as having a nationalistic aspect. It was not until the late 1970s that Friedrich regained his reputation as an icon of the German Romantic movement and a painter of international importance.\nLife.\nEarly years and family.\nCaspar David Friedrich was born on 5 September 1774, in Greifswald, Swedish Pomerania, on the Baltic coast of Germany. The sixth of ten children, he was raised in the strict Lutheran creed of his father Adolf Gottlieb Friedrich, a candle-maker and soap boiler. Records of the family's financial circumstances are contradictory; while some sources indicate the children were privately tutored, others record that they were raised in relative poverty. He became familiar with death from an early age. His mother, Sophie, died in 1781 when he was seven. A year later, his sister Elisabeth died, and a second sister, Maria, succumbed to typhus in 1791. Arguably the greatest tragedy of his childhood happened in 1787 when his brother Johann Christoffer died: at the age of thirteen, Caspar David witnessed his younger brother fall through the ice of a frozen lake, and drown. Some accounts suggest that Johann Christoffer perished while trying to rescue Caspar David, who was also in danger on the ice.\nFriedrich began his formal study of art in 1790 as a private student of artist Johann Gottfried Quistorp at the University of Greifswald in his home city, at which the art department is now named \"Caspar-David-Friedrich-Institut\" in his honour. Quistorp took his students on outdoor drawing excursions; as a result, Friedrich was encouraged to sketch from life at an early age. Through Quistorp, Friedrich met and was subsequently influenced by the theologian Ludwig Gotthard Kosegarten, who taught that nature was a revelation of God. Quistorp introduced Friedrich to the work of the German 17th-century artist Adam Elsheimer, whose works often included religious subjects dominated by landscape, and nocturnal subjects. During this period he also studied literature and aesthetics with Swedish professor Thomas Thorild. Four years later Friedrich entered the prestigious Academy of Copenhagen, where he began his education by making copies of casts from antique sculptures before proceeding to drawing from life. Living in Copenhagen afforded the young painter access to the Royal Picture Gallery's collection of 17th-century Dutch landscape painting. At the Academy he studied under teachers such as Christian August Lorentzen and the landscape painter Jens Juel. These artists were inspired by the \"Sturm und Drang\" movement and represented a midpoint between the dramatic intensity and expressive manner of the budding Romantic aesthetic and the waning neo-classical ideal. Mood was paramount, and influence was drawn from such sources as the Icelandic legend of Edda, the poems of Ossian and Norse mythology.\nMove to Dresden.\nFriedrich settled permanently in Dresden in 1798. During this early period, he experimented in printmaking with etchings and designs for woodcuts which his furniture-maker brother cut. By 1804 he had produced 18 etchings and four woodcuts; they were apparently made in small numbers and only distributed to friends. Despite these forays into other media, he gravitated toward working primarily with ink, watercolour and sepias. With the exception of a few early pieces, such as \"\" (1797), he did not work extensively with oils until his reputation was more established. Landscapes were his preferred subject, inspired by frequent trips, beginning in 1801, to the Baltic coast, Bohemia, the Krkono\u0161e and the Harz Mountains. Mostly based on the landscapes of northern Germany, his paintings depict woods, hills, harbors, morning mists and other light effects based on a close observation of nature. These works were modeled on sketches and studies of scenic spots, such as the cliffs on R\u00fcgen, the surroundings of Dresden and the river Elbe. He executed his studies almost exclusively in pencil, even providing topographical information, yet the subtle atmospheric effects characteristic of Friedrich's mid-period paintings were rendered from memory. These effects took their strength from the depiction of light, and of the illumination of sun and moon on clouds and water: optical phenomena peculiar to the Baltic coast that had never before been painted with such an emphasis.\nHis reputation as an artist was established when he won a prize in 1805 at the Weimar competition organised by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. At the time, the Weimar competition tended to draw mediocre and now-forgotten artists presenting derivative mixtures of neo-classical and pseudo-Greek styles. The poor quality of the entries began to prove damaging to Goethe's reputation, so when Friedrich entered two sepia drawings\u2014\"Procession at Dawn\" and \"Fisher-Folk by the Sea\"\u2014the poet responded enthusiastically and wrote, \"We must praise the artist's resourcefulness in this picture fairly. The drawing is well done, the procession is ingenious and appropriate\u00a0... his treatment combines a great deal of firmness, diligence and neatness\u00a0... the ingenious watercolour\u00a0... is also worthy of praise.\"\nFriedrich completed the first of his major paintings in 1808, at the age of 34. \"Cross in the Mountains\", today known as the \"Tetschen Altar\", is an altarpiece panel said to have been commissioned for a family chapel in Tetschen, Bohemia. The panel depicts a cross in profile at the top of a mountain, alone, and surrounded by pine trees. Controversially, for the first time in Christian art, an altarpiece had showcased a landscape. According to art historian Linda Siegel, Friedrich's design was the \"logical climax of many earlier drawings of his which depicted a cross in nature's world.\"\nAlthough the altarpiece was generally coldly received, it was Friedrich's first painting to receive wide publicity. The artist's friends publicly defended the work, while art critic Basilius von Ramdohr published a long article challenging Friedrich's use of landscape in a religious context. He rejected the idea that landscape painting could convey explicit meaning, writing that it would be \"a veritable presumption, if landscape painting were to sneak into the church and creep onto the altar\". Friedrich responded with a programme describing his intentions in 1809, comparing the rays of the evening sun to the light of the Holy Father. This statement marked the only time Friedrich recorded a detailed interpretation of his own work, and the painting was among the few commissions the artist ever received.\nFollowing the purchase of two of his paintings by the Prussian Crown Prince, Friedrich was elected a member of the Berlin Academy in 1810. Yet in 1816, he sought to distance himself from Prussian authority and applied that June for Saxon citizenship. The move was not expected; the Saxon government was pro-French, while Friedrich's paintings were seen as generally patriotic and distinctly anti-French. Nevertheless, with the aid of his Dresden-based friend Graf Vitzthum von Eckst\u00e4dt, Friedrich attained citizenship, and in 1818, membership in the Saxon Academy with a yearly dividend of 150 thalers. Although he had hoped to receive a full professorship, it was never awarded him as, according to the German Library of Information, \"it was felt that his painting was too personal, his point of view too individual to serve as a fruitful example to students.\" Politics too may have played a role in stalling his career: Friedrich's decidedly Germanic subjects and costuming frequently clashed with the era's prevailing pro-French attitudes.\nMarriage.\nOn 21 January 1818, Friedrich married Caroline Bommer, the twenty-five-year-old daughter of a dyer from Dresden. The couple had three children, with their first, Emma, arriving in 1820. Physiologist and painter Carl Gustav Carus notes in his biographical essays that marriage did not impact significantly on either Friedrich's life or personality, yet his canvasses from this period, including \"Chalk Cliffs on R\u00fcgen\"\u2014painted after his honeymoon\u2014display a new sense of levity, while his palette is brighter and less austere. Human figures appear with increasing frequency in the paintings of this period, which Siegel interprets as a reflection that \"the importance of human life, particularly his family, now occupies his thoughts more and more, and his friends, his wife, and his townspeople appear as frequent subjects in his art.\"\nAround this time, he found support from two sources in Russia. In 1820, the Grand Duke Nikolai Pavlovich, at the behest of his wife Alexandra Feodorovna, visited Friedrich's studio and returned to Saint Petersburg with a number of his paintings, an exchange that began a patronage that continued for many years. Not long thereafter, the poet Vasily Zhukovsky, tutor to Alexander II, met Friedrich in 1821 and found in him a kindred spirit. For decades Zhukovsky helped Friedrich both by purchasing his work himself and by recommending his art to the royal family; his assistance toward the end of Friedrich's career proved invaluable to the ailing and impoverished artist. Zhukovsky remarked that his friend's paintings \"please us by their precision, each of them awakening a memory in our mind.\"\nFriedrich was acquainted with Philipp Otto Runge, another leading German painter of the Romantic period. He was also a friend of Georg Friedrich Kersting, and painted him at work in his unadorned studio, and of the Norwegian painter Johan Christian Clausen Dahl (1788\u20131857). Dahl was close to Friedrich during the artist's final years, and he expressed dismay that to the art-buying public, Friedrich's pictures were only \"curiosities\". While the poet Zhukovsky appreciated Friedrich's psychological themes, Dahl praised the descriptive quality of Friedrich's landscapes, commenting that \"artists and connoisseurs saw in Friedrich's art only a kind of mystic, because they themselves were only looking out for the mystic\u00a0... They did not see Friedrich's faithful and conscientious study of nature in everything he represented\".\nDuring this period Friedrich frequently sketched memorial monuments and sculptures for mausoleums, reflecting his obsession with death and the afterlife; he even created designs for some of the funerary art in Dresden's cemeteries. Some of these works were lost in the fire that destroyed Munich's Glass Palace (1931) and later in the 1945 bombing of Dresden.\nLater life and death.\nFriedrich's reputation steadily declined over the final fifteen years of his life. As the ideals of early Romanticism passed from fashion, he came to be viewed as an eccentric and melancholy character, out of touch with the times. Gradually his patrons fell away. By 1820, he was living as a recluse and was described by friends as the \"most solitary of the solitary\". Towards the end of his life he lived in relative poverty. He became isolated and spent long periods of the day and night walking alone through woods and fields, often beginning his strolls before sunrise.\nIn June 1835, Friedrich suffered his first stroke, which left him with minor limb paralysis and greatly reduced his ability to paint. As a result, he was unable to work in oil; instead he was limited to watercolour, sepia and reworking older compositions.\nAlthough his vision remained strong, he had lost the full strength of his hand. Yet he was able to produce a final 'black painting', \"Seashore by Moonlight\" (1835\u201336), described by Vaughan as the \"darkest of all his shorelines, in which richness of tonality compensates for the lack of his former finesse\".\nSymbols of death appeared in his other work from this period. Soon after his stroke, the Russian royal family purchased a number of his earlier works, and the proceeds allowed him to travel to Teplitz\u2014in today's Czech Republic\u2014to recover.\nDuring the mid-1830s, Friedrich began a series of portraits and he returned to observing himself in nature. As the art historian William Vaughan has observed, however, \"He can see himself as a man greatly changed. He is no longer the upright, supportive figure that appeared in \"Two Men Contemplating the Moon\" in 1819. He is old and stiff\u00a0... he moves with a stoop\".\nBy 1838, he was capable only of working in a small format. He and his family were living in poverty and grew increasingly dependent for support on the charity of friends.\nFriedrich died in Dresden on 7 May 1840, and was buried in Dresden's Trinitatis-Friedhof (Trinity Cemetery) east of the city centre (the entrance to which he had painted some 15 years earlier). The simple flat gravestone lies north-west of the central roundel within the main avenue.\nBy the time of his death, his reputation and fame were waning, and his passing was little noticed within the artistic community. His artwork had certainly been acknowledged during his lifetime, but not widely. While the close study of landscape and an emphasis on the spiritual elements of nature were commonplace in contemporary art, his work was too original and personal to be well understood. By 1838, his work no longer sold or received attention from critics; the Romantic movement had been moving away from the early idealism that the artist had helped found.\nAfter his death, Carl Gustav Carus wrote a series of articles which paid tribute to Friedrich's transformation of the conventions of landscape painting. However, Carus' articles placed Friedrich firmly in his time, and did not place the artist within a continuing tradition. Only one of his paintings had been reproduced as a print, and that was produced in very few copies.\nThemes.\nLandscape and the sublime.\nThe visualisation and portrayal of landscape in an entirely new manner was Friedrich's key innovation. He sought not just to explore the blissful enjoyment of a beautiful view, as in the classic conception, but rather to examine an instant of sublimity, a reunion with the spiritual self through the contemplation of nature. Friedrich was instrumental in transforming landscape in art from a backdrop subordinated to human drama to a self-contained emotive subject. Friedrich's paintings commonly employed the \"R\u00fcckenfigur\"\u2014a person seen from behind, contemplating the view. The viewer is encouraged to place himself in the position of the \"R\u00fcckenfigur\", by which means he experiences the sublime potential of nature, understanding that the scene is as perceived and idealised by a human. Friedrich created the notion of a landscape full of romantic feeling\u2014\"die romantische Stimmungslandschaft\". His art details a wide range of geographical features, such as rock coasts, forests, and mountain scenes. He often used the landscape to express religious themes. During his time, most of the best-known paintings were viewed as expressions of a religious mysticism.\nFriedrich said, \"The artist should paint not only what he sees before him, but also what he sees within him. If, however, he sees nothing within him, then he should also refrain from painting that which he sees before him. Otherwise, his pictures will be like those folding screens behind which one expects to find only the sick or the dead.\" Expansive skies, storms, mist, forests, ruins and crosses bearing witness to the presence of God are frequent elements in Friedrich's landscapes. Though death finds symbolic expression in boats that move away from shore\u2014a Charon-like motif\u2014and in the poplar tree, it is referenced more directly in paintings like \"The Abbey in the Oakwood\" (1808\u201310), in which monks carry a coffin past an open grave, toward a cross, and through the portal of a church in ruins.\nHe was one of the first artists to portray winter landscapes in which the land is rendered as stark and dead. Friedrich's winter scenes are solemn and still\u2014according to the art historian Hermann Beenken, Friedrich painted winter scenes in which \"no man has yet set his foot. The theme of nearly all the older winter pictures had been less winter itself than life in winter. In the 16th and 17th centuries, it was thought impossible to leave out such motifs as the crowd of skaters, the wanderer... It was Friedrich who first felt the wholly detached and distinctive features of a natural life. Instead of many tones, he sought the one; and so, in his landscape, he subordinated the composite chord into one single basic note\".\nBare oak trees and tree stumps, such as those in \"\" (c. 1822), \"Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon\" (c. 1824), and \"Willow Bush under a Setting Sun\" (c. 1835), are recurring elements of Friedrich's paintings, symbolizing death. Countering the sense of despair are Friedrich's symbols for redemption: the cross and the clearing sky promise eternal life, and the slender moon suggests hope and the growing closeness of Christ. In his paintings of the sea, anchors often appear on the shore, also indicating a spiritual hope. German literature scholar Alice Kuzniar finds in Friedrich's painting a temporality\u2014an evocation of the passage of time\u2014that is rarely highlighted in the visual arts. For example, in \"The Abbey in the Oakwood\", the movement of the monks away from the open grave and toward the cross and the horizon imparts Friedrich's message that the final destination of man's life lies beyond the grave.\nWith dawn and dusk constituting prominent themes of his landscapes, Friedrich's own later years were characterized by a growing pessimism. His work becomes darker, revealing a fearsome monumentality. \"The Wreck of the Hope\"\u2014also known as \"The Polar Sea\" or \"The Sea of Ice\" (1823\u201324)\u2014perhaps best summarizes Friedrich's ideas and aims at this point, though in such a radical way that the painting was not well received. Completed in 1824, it depicted a grim subject, a shipwreck in the Arctic Ocean; \"the image he produced, with its grinding slabs of travertine-colored floe ice chewing up a wooden ship, goes beyond documentary into allegory: the frail bark of human aspiration crushed by the world's immense and glacial indifference.\"\nFriedrich's written commentary on aesthetics was limited to a collection of aphorisms set down in 1830, in which he explained the need for the artist to match natural observation with an introspective scrutiny of his own personality. His best-known remark advises the artist to \"close your bodily eye so that you may see your picture first with the spiritual eye. Then bring to the light of day that which you have seen in the darkness so that it may react upon others from the outside inwards.\" He rejected the overreaching portrayals of nature in its \"totality\", as found in the work of contemporary painters like Adrian Ludwig Richter (1803\u201384) and Joseph Anton Koch (1768\u20131839).\nLoneliness and death.\nBoth Friedrich's life and art have at times been perceived by some to have been marked with an overwhelming sense of loneliness. Art historians and some of his contemporaries attribute such interpretations to the losses suffered during his youth to the bleak outlook of his adulthood, while Friedrich's pale and withdrawn appearance helped reinforce the popular notion of the \"taciturn man from the North\".\nFriedrich suffered depressive episodes in 1799, 1803\u20131805, c.1813, in 1816 and between 1824 and 1826. There are noticeable thematic shifts in the works he produced during these episodes, which see the emergence of such motifs and symbols as vultures, owls, graveyards and ruins. From 1826 these motifs became a permanent feature of his output, while his use of color became more dark and muted. Carus wrote in 1929 that Friedrich \"is surrounded by a thick, gloomy cloud of spiritual uncertainty\", though the noted art historian and curator Hubertus Gassner disagrees with such notions, seeing in Friedrich's work a positive and life-affirming subtext inspired by Freemasonry and religion.\nGermanic folklore.\nReflecting Friedrich's patriotism and resentment during the 1813 French occupation of the dominion of Pomerania, motifs from German folklore became increasingly prominent in his work. An anti-French German nationalist, Friedrich used motifs from his native landscape to celebrate Germanic culture, customs and mythology. He was impressed by the anti-Napoleonic poetry of Ernst Moritz Arndt and Theodor K\u00f6rner, and the patriotic literature of Adam M\u00fcller and Heinrich von Kleist. Moved by the deaths of three friends killed in battle against France, as well as by Kleist's 1808 drama \"Die Hermannsschlacht\", Friedrich undertook a number of paintings in which he intended to convey political symbols solely by means of the landscape\u2014a first in the history of art.\nIn ' (1812), a dilapidated monument inscribed \"Arminius\" invokes the Germanic chieftain, a symbol of nationalism, while the four tombs of fallen heroes are slightly ajar, freeing their spirits for eternity. Two French soldiers appear as small figures before a cave, lower and deep in a grotto surrounded by rock, as if farther from heaven. A second political painting, ' (c. 1813), depicts a lost French soldier dwarfed by a dense forest, while on a tree stump a raven is perched\u2014a prophet of doom, symbolizing the anticipated defeat of France.\nLegacy.\nInfluence.\nAlongside other Romantic painters, Friedrich helped position landscape painting as a major genre within Western art. Of his contemporaries, Friedrich's style most influenced the painting of Johan Christian Dahl (1788\u20131857). Among later generations, Arnold B\u00f6cklin (1827\u20131901) was strongly influenced by his work, and the substantial presence of Friedrich's works in Russian collections influenced many Russian painters, in particular Arkhip Kuindzhi (c. 1842\u20131910) and Ivan Shishkin (1832\u201398). Friedrich's spirituality anticipated American painters such as Albert Pinkham Ryder (1847\u20131917), Ralph Blakelock (1847\u20131919), the painters of the Hudson River School and the New England Luminists.\nAt the turn of the 20th century, Friedrich was rediscovered by the Norwegian art historian Andreas Aubert (1851\u20131913), whose writing initiated modern Friedrich scholarship, and by the Symbolist painters, who valued his visionary and allegorical landscapes. The Norwegian Symbolist Edvard Munch (1863\u20131944) would have seen Friedrich's work during a visit to Berlin in the 1880s. Munch's 1899 print \"The Lonely Ones\" echoes Friedrich's \"R\u00fcckenfigur (back figure)\", although in Munch's work the focus has shifted away from the broad landscape and toward the sense of dislocation between the two melancholy figures in the foreground.\nFriedrich's modern revival gained momentum in 1906, when thirty-two of his works were featured in an exhibition in Berlin of Romantic-era art. His landscapes exercised a strong influence on the work of German artist Max Ernst (1891\u20131976), and as a result other Surrealists came to view Friedrich as a precursor to their movement. In 1934, the Belgian painter Ren\u00e9 Magritte (1898\u20131967) paid tribute in his work \"The Human Condition\", which directly echoes motifs from Friedrich's art in its questioning of perception and the role of the viewer. A few years later, the Surrealist journal \"Minotaure\" featured Friedrich in a 1939 article by critic Marie Landsberger, thereby exposing his work to a far wider circle of artists. The influence of \"The Wreck of Hope\" (or \"The Sea of Ice\") is evident in the 1940\u201341 painting \"Totes Meer\" by Paul Nash (1889\u20131946), a fervent admirer of Ernst. Friedrich's work has been cited as an inspiration by other major 20th-century artists, including Mark Rothko (1903\u20131970), Gerhard Richter (b. 1932), Gotthard Graubner and Anselm Kiefer (b. 1945). Friedrich's Romantic paintings have also been singled out by writer Samuel Beckett (1906\u201389), who, standing before \"Man and Woman Contemplating the Moon\", said \"This was the source of \"Waiting for Godot\", you know.\"\nIn his 1961 article \"The Abstract Sublime\", originally published in \"ARTnews\", the art historian Robert Rosenblum drew comparisons between the Romantic landscape paintings of both Friedrich and Turner with the Abstract Expressionist paintings of Mark Rothko. Rosenblum specifically describes Friedrich's 1809 painting \"The Monk by the Sea\", Turner's \"The Evening Star\" and Rothko's 1954 \"Light, Earth and Blue\" as revealing affinities of vision and feeling. According to Rosenblum, \"Rothko, like Friedrich and Turner, places us on the threshold of those shapeless infinities discussed by the aestheticians of the Sublime. The tiny monk in the Friedrich and the fisher in the Turner establish a poignant contrast between the infinite vastness of a pantheistic God and the infinite smallness of His creatures. In the abstract language of Rothko, such literal detail\u2014a bridge of empathy between the real spectator and the presentation of a transcendental landscape\u2014is no longer necessary; we ourselves are the monk before the sea, standing silently and contemplatively before these huge and soundless pictures as if we were looking at a sunset or a moonlit night.\"\nThe contemporary artist Christiane Pooley gets inspired by Friedrich's work for her landscapes reinterpreting the history of Chile.\nCritical opinion.\nUntil 1890, and especially after his friends had died, Friedrich's work lay in near-oblivion for decades. Yet, by 1890, the symbolism in his work began to ring true with the artistic mood of the day, especially in central Europe. However, despite a renewed interest and an acknowledgment of his originality, his lack of regard for \"painterly effect\" and thinly rendered surfaces jarred with the theories of the time.\nDuring the 1930s, Friedrich's work was used in the promotion of Nazi ideology, which attempted to fit the Romantic artist within the nationalistic \"Blut und Boden\". It took decades for Friedrich's reputation to recover from this association with Nazism. His reliance on symbolism and the fact that his work fell outside the narrow definitions of modernism contributed to his fall from favour. In 1949, art historian Kenneth Clark wrote that Friedrich \"worked in the frigid technique of his time, which could hardly inspire a school of modern painting\", and suggested that the artist was trying to express in painting what is best left to poetry. Clark's dismissal of Friedrich reflected the damage the artist's reputation sustained during the late 1930s.\nFriedrich's reputation suffered further damage when his imagery was adopted by a number of Hollywood directors, such as Walt Disney, built on the work of such German cinema masters as Fritz Lang and F. W. Murnau, within the horror and fantasy genres. His rehabilitation was slow, but enhanced through the writings of such critics and scholars as Werner Hofmann, Helmut B\u00f6rsch-Supan and Sigrid Hinz, who successfully rejected and rebutted the political associations ascribed to his work, and placed it within a purely art-historical context. By the 1970s, he was again being exhibited in major galleries across the world, as he found favour with a new generation of critics and art historians.\nToday, his international reputation is well established. He is a national icon in his native Germany, and highly regarded by art historians and art connoisseurs across the Western World. He is generally viewed as a figure of great psychological complexity, and according to Vaughan, \"a believer who struggled with doubt, a celebrator of beauty haunted by darkness. In the end, he transcends interpretation, reaching across cultures through the compelling appeal of his imagery. He has truly emerged as a butterfly\u2014hopefully one that will never again disappear from our sight\".\nWork.\nFriedrich was a prolific artist who produced more than 500 attributed works. In line with the Romantic ideals of his time, he intended his paintings to function as pure aesthetic statements, so he was cautious that the titles given to his work were not overly descriptive or evocative. It is likely that some of today's more literal titles, such as \"The Stages of Life\", were not given by the artist himself, but were instead adopted during one of the revivals of interest in Friedrich. Complications arise when dating Friedrich's work, in part because he often did not directly name or date his canvases. He kept a carefully detailed notebook on his output, however, which has been used by scholars to tie paintings to their completion dates."}
{"title": "Gustave_Moreau", "label": "Artist", "text": "Gustave Moreau (; 6 April 1826 \u2013 18 April 1898) was a French artist and an important figure in the Symbolist movement. Jean Cassou called him \"the Symbolist painter par excellence.\" He was an influential forerunner of symbolism in the visual arts in the 1860s, and at the height of the symbolist movement in the 1890s, he was among the most significant painters. Art historian Robert Delevoy wrote that Moreau \"brought symbolist polyvalence to its highest point in \"Jupiter and Semele\"\" He was a prolific artist who produced over 15,000 paintings, watercolors, and drawings. Moreau painted allegories and traditional biblical and mythological subjects favored by the fine art academies. J. K. Huysmans wrote \" Gustave Moreau has given new freshness to dreary old subjects by a talent both subtle and ample: he has taken myths worn out by the repetitions of centuries and expressed them in a language that is persuasive and lofty, mysterious and new.\" The female characters from the bible and mythology that he so frequently depicted came to be regarded by many as the archetypical symbolist woman. His art (and symbolism in general) fell from favor and received little attention in the early 20th century but, beginning in the 1960s and 70s, he has come to be considered among the most paramount of symbolist painters.\nGustave Moreau was born in Paris and showed an aptitude for drawing at an early age. He received a sound education at Coll\u00e8ge Rollin (now Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour) and traditional academic training in painting at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. In the early 1850s he developed a close friendship/mentorship with Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau and had some modest success exhibiting as the Paris Salon. Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau's premature death in 1856 deeply affected Moreau and he left Paris to travel in Italy 1857-59, returning with hundreds of copies and studies he made of old master paintings there. In 1864 his painting \"Oedipus and the Sphinx\" received a great deal attention at the Paris Salon, winning a medal, and establishing his reputation. He had continued success through the 1860s, gradually gaining a select group of enthusiastic and loyal admirers and collectors. Although his painting \"Prometheus\" received a medal at the Salon of 1869, criticisms in the press were severe and he did not submit paintings to the Salon again until 1876, permanently withdrawing after 1880.\nMoreau was decorated Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'Honneur in 1883. Somewhat misanthropic, he grew increasingly reclusive in later years, although he maintained a close circle of friends. He was often reluctant to sell his work, seldom exhibited, and turned down a number of prestigious offers, including an invitation to exhibit at the Salon Les XX in Brussels (1887), rejected the post of a professor when he was elected to the Ecole des Beaux-Arts (1888), and offers to decorate buildings at the Sorbonne (1891). It was only after the death of his friend \u00c9lie Delaunay in 1891 that he agreed to takeover Delaunay's studio at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He excelled as a teacher, counting Henri Matisse, Georges Rouault, and other notable artists amongst his pupils. His parents bought a townhouse in 1852 at 14 Rue de La Rochefoucauld, converting the top floor into a studio for Moreau, where he lived and worked, a bachelor, for the rest of his life, his father passing away in 1862, and his mother, Ad\u00e8le-Pauline in 1884. He died of cancer in 1898, bequeathing the townhome and studio with nearly 1200 paintings and watercolors, and over 10,000 drawings to the State to be converted into a museum. The Mus\u00e9e Gustave Moreau opened to the public in 1903 and is still open today. It is by far the largest and most significant collection of his work.\nBiography.\nEducation and early career (1826-1856).\nGustave Moreau was born in Paris, into a cultured, upper-middle-class family. His father, Louis Jean Marie Moreau (1790-1862), was an architect, his mother, n\u00e9e Ad\u00e8le Pauline Desmoutier (1802-1884) was a musician. During a turbulent period in French history his father worked for the city of Paris, but being of liberal leanings, he was at times dismissed, and later reinstated from various offices as powers shifted. The family lived in Vesoul, France from 1827 to 1830. After the July Revolution of 1830, he was appointed highway commissioner for the city of Paris. Although the office was not highly revered, his duties were more varied than the title suggest and he remained there until he retired in 1858. As a child Moreau was of frail health. Beginning at about the age of eight, Moreau started drawing incessantly. In 1837 he began attending the Coll\u00e8ge Rollin (Coll\u00e8ge-lyc\u00e9e Jacques-Decour) in Paris as a boarder, but in 1840 when his older sister died at the age of 13, he was withdrawn from the school and lived a somewhat sheltered life with his parents. His father encouraged and supported his artistic tendencies but was adamant that he received a solid classical education. Moreau learned Greek, Latin, and read both French and classical literature in his father's rather substantial library. He learned piano and was a very good tenor. In 1841 he visited Italy with his mother and relatives, where he filled a 60 page album with drawings.\nVisiting museums and galleries in Italy profoundly impressed Moreau and influenced his resolution to pursue a career as an artist. Upon returning in 1841 he started attending a drawing studio in the evenings. In 1844 he entered the private studio of Fran\u00e7ois-\u00c9douard Picot, a member of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, who offered classes to aspiring young artists to prepare for the entrance examinations at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. In 1846 Moreau was admitted to Picot's formal class at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts. Moreau had grand aspirations of winning the prestigious Grand Prix de Rome, but when he failed to make the final rounds in 1848 and 1849 he left the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts prematurely. Moreau's style soon drifted away from those favored by the academy, however many of the basic Beaux-Arts methods and concepts he learned would remain with him for the rest of his life, as would his commitment to history painting.\nMoreau spent his time copying paintings in the Louvre and was soon drawn to romanticism. Two contemporary artist he greatly admired were Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix and Th\u00e9odore Chass\u00e9riau, both of whom lived and worked in his neighborhood. Chass\u00e9riau, had entered the private studio of the great Neoclassical painter Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres at the age ten and later spent time with Ingres at the French Academy in Rome, but in his late teens he turned away from Neoclassicism to Delacroix and romanticism. Chass\u00e9riau never attended the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts but he was driven and hardworking and managed to establish a reputation for himself, securing commissions, and living a rather bohemian and sometimes turbulent life. Moreau developed a good friendship with Chass\u00e9riau, seven years his senior, and rented a studio near Chass\u00e9riau's. He soon followed suit, becoming something of a dapper man about town during this period, attending the opera, theater, even singing at the social gatherings he frequented. Anecdotal accounts say Moreau visited Delacroix's studio around 1850, who was 28 years older than Moreau, but there is little evidence of a relationship beyond that.\nMoreau's father bought a townhome at 14 rue de la Rochefoucauld in 1853, converting the top floor into a studio for Moreau, where he and his parents lived for the rest of their lives. Shortly before moving in, Moreau had started an ambitious canvas, \"a scene of epic slaughter\" based on an episode from the \"Odyssey\", titled \"The Suitors\" (1852-1896). He worked on the painting on and off for the rest of his life, even adding strips of canvas to enlarge the work to a monumental 3.85 x 3.43 meters, but it was still unfinished at the time of his death. Moreau began exhibiting his work with some regularity in the 1850s. He secured some commissions form the city for paintings with the help of his father. He participated in the Paris Salon for the first time in 1852, presenting a \"Pieta\" which was purchased by the state for 600 francs. In the Salon of 1853 he exhibited \"Darius Fleeing after the Battle of Arbela\" and \"Song of Songs\", both showing some influence of Chass\u00e9riau, and the latter bought by the state for 2,000 francs for the Dijon Museum. There was no Salon in 1854, although he received a commission from the state in 1854 for \"Athenians being Delivered to the Minotaur in the Cretan Labyrinth\" which was shown at the 1855 Paris World's Fair and purchased for 4,000 francs for the Bourg-en-Bresse Museum. After a few short weeks of declining health in 1856, Chass\u00e9riau died at the age of 37. On October 10, 1856, Delacroix noted in his journal \"Funeral procession of poor Chass\u00e9riau. I saw Dauzats, Diaz, and the young Moreau. I quite like him\" Moreau started work on \"The Young Man and Death\" in 1856, finished in 1865 and dedicated to Chass\u00e9riau.\nItaly (1857-1859).\nThe death of Chasseriau in 1856 caused Moreau in his grief to withdraw from public life. Concerned about his condition, Moreau's parents suggested he travel to Italy again. Living in Italy, he found a renewed love for art. He gained inspiration from the artists of the Italian Renaissance, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo. \nMoreau left Paris in October 1857 with his friend, artist Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Charlot de Courcy, sailing from Marseille to Civitavecchia and on to Rome. He approached his time in Italy as a period of extended study, a compensation of sorts for his premature withdrawal from the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. He approached his time in Italy as a period of extended study, a compensation for his premature withdraw from the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in Paris of sorts. After a few days of getting oriented and taking in the sights he began studying and copying art in the city in earnest. He spent the better part of two months in the Sistine Chapel copying figures from the ceiling seven or eight hours a day. He copied the work of relatively obscure and unknown artist as often as the established masters. He was particularly interested in examining complex grouping of multiple figures and compositional color schemes. He also frequented the Villa Medici, where he could work from live models, and there he established friendships with other Parisians studying in Italy, including Elie Delaunay, Henri Chapu, \u00c9mile L\u00e9vy, and Georges Bizet. He met a young Edgar Degas, for whom Moreau was to become something of a mentor while in Italy. In August 1858 he was joined by his parents. His father, having recently retired, was particularly interested in the architecture. In Venice he developed a fascination with Vittore Carpaccio, a little known artist at that time, and copied several of his works. Visits were made to Florence, Milan, Pisa, and Siena.\nThe Second Italian War of Independence broke out in the spring of 1859, making the summer in Naples and Pompeii a tense period. Moreau largely copied the work of others in Italy, and produced only a few original works there. Examples include some large drawings on the theme of \"Hesiod and the Muse\" and a number of fine landscapes in watercolors, painted en plein air. In September 1859 Moreau and his parents returned to Paris with several hundred drawings and paintings. Back in Paris, Degas painted a small portrait of Moreau in 1860, that hung in Moreau's studio for the rest of his life. However, their relationship began to drift as Degas soon fell under the influence of \u00c9douard Manet and the impressionist, while Moreau stayed focused on history painting. Moreau once remarked to Degas \"You pretend to be able to renew art through ballet?\" to which Degas replied \"And you think you will be able to do it by jewelry?\"\nSalon success and mid career (1860-1880).\nMoreau never married and very little information is known about his personal and romantic relationships. In the past some biographers speculated that he was gay, largely inferred from the fact that he was a bachelor, a lack of information regarding women in his life, and the sometimes effeminate or androgynous appearance of male figures in some of his paintings. However, more recent research and documents revealed a relationship with Adelaide-Alexandrine Dureux (b. Guise, 8 November 1835 \u2013 d. Paris, March 1890) that lasted over 30 years. Moreau apparently met Alexandrine soon after his return from Italy and in following years he produced many drawings and watercolors of her, as well as romantic caricatures of the two of them walking on clouds together. He subsidized an apartment for her on Rue Norte-Dame de Lorette, just a few blocks from the townhome where he lived with his parents. Their relationship was very discreet and known by only a few in his closest circle. His mother was aware of their relationship and apparently fond of her, as indicated by a stipulation in her will that provided an annuity for Alexandrine should Gustave die before her. He designed her tombstone, engraved with their interlaced initials, A and G, which is located near his family plot where he was interned with his parents.\n\"Oedipus and the Sphinx\", one of his first Symbolist paintings, won a medal at the Salon in 1864. Its style revealed his close study of the work of Vittore Carpaccio, Mantegna and Giovanni Bellini. Its firm outlines and detailed modeling are typical of the works that brought him success with critics and the public for the remainder of the decade. Moreau quickly gained a reputation for eccentricity. One commentator said Moreau's work was \"like a pastiche of Mantegna created by a German student who relaxes from his painting by reading Schopenhauer.\" The painting currently resides in the permanent collection at the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.\nIn the 1870s, disturbed by criticism that his work had become formulaic, he stopped exhibiting for a few years while he concentrated on renewing his art. In 1876 he completed \"Salome Dancing before Herod\", which announced a more painterly style that would characterize his later works.\nHe was made a Chevalier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1875 and was promoted to an Officier de la L\u00e9gion d'honneur in 1883.\nTeaching and later career (1881-1898).\nMoreau increasingly withdrew from society in his later years, he stopped exhibiting at the Salon, and refused to exhibit abroad. However he continued to produce paintings and sporadically exhibited his work in other venues such as the 1889 Paris Worlds Fair. He occasionally entertained guest at his townhome and was known for his engaging conversation, but visitors were rarely allowed in his studio to see his work. He was exceptionally cultivated, erudite, and a voracious reader with a personal library of over 1,600 volumes. Compared to other artist who had achieved his level of success in Paris at that time, he live a fairly modest lifestyle. Edgar Degas, who lived nearby and occasionally still interacted with him, described Moreau in later years as \"a hermit who knows what time the trains leave.\"\nArt collector Anthony Roux commissioned several artist to produce works based on Jean de La Fontaine's Fables in 1879, including Moreau, Paul-Jacques-Aim\u00e9 Baudry, Jules-\u00c9lie Delaunay, Gustave Dor\u00e9, Henri Gervex, Henri Harpignies, Ernest H\u00e9bert, N\u00e9lie Jacquemart, Eug\u00e8ne Lami, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Raffa\u00eblli, F\u00e9lix Ziem, and others. The results were all exhibited together in 1881 at Cercle des Aquarellistes in Paris. The exhibit was celebrated by the critics of the day, and Moreau's work (who completed 25 pieces, more than any other) was judged far superior to majority of the others. Moreau alone was commissioned to continue the series. In the only private show in his life, 64 La Fontaine fables with six other large watercolor were exhibited at the Goupil &amp; Cie Gallery in 1886, were Th\u00ebo Van Gogh was manager, and later in London. The series was exhibited again posthumously in Paris in 1906 and one was donated to the Mus\u00e9e national Gustave Moreau. Remarkably, after Roux's death in 1914, 63 of the watercolors were sold to a single collector, and although regarded as among his finest work, they were not exhibited by the buyer, or their heirs for well over 100 years, and known only from some early, low quality black and white reproductions. Nearly half of the paintings later disappeared during the reign of the Nazis and have not resurfaced.\nMoreau and his mother were very close throughout his life. She lost her hearing in her later years and Gustave communicated with her by writing notes on slips of paper, often giving his thoughts regarding the paintings he was working on. His assistant Henri Rupp saved many of the notes which are archived at the museum and provide significant insight into Moreau's ideas on his art. The death of his mother at the age of 82 in 1884 caused him deep despair. For a while he could not spend nights alone in the family townhome and took refuge at the apartment of Alexandrine Dureux nearby. Ultimately, the room where his mother died was left unchanged and became something of a shrine that he never entered. Six years later he was at Alexandrine Dureux's bedside when she died on 28 March 1890 after five months of deteriorating health. Her death also affected him greatly. He bought back several watercolors that he had given her over the years and some furniture from her heirs, which he placed in a room of his townhome in her memory. Both deaths reinforced his isolation and he buried himself in his work, which took on an even greater melancholic edge.\nMoreau was elected into the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts in 1888, but he declined professorship and a class, and the director Paul Dubois, exempted him from all formal obligations. However on his death bed, \u00c9lie Delaunay (a close friend since their time in Rome), asked Moreau to succeed him and direct one of the main ateliers at the school. Moreau reluctantly took the class on a temporary basis in October 1891, but later accepted the appointment of professor and atelier director in January 1892 at the age of six-five. Moreau was a contrasting individual from the academic artists at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, including L\u00e9on G\u00ebr\u00f4me, L\u00e9on Bonnat, William Bougueruau, Jean-Paul Laurens, Luc-Olivier Merson, and Jules-Eug\u00e8ne Lenepveu. About 125 students passed through Moreau's alter between 1891 and 1898, among them were Pierre Marcel-B\u00e9ronneau, Simon Bussy, Charles Camoin, Henri Evenepoel, Jules Flandrin, Raoul du Gardier, Jacques Gr\u00fcber, Charles-Fran\u00e7ois-Prosper Gu\u00e9rin, Henri Matisse, Albert Marquet, Henri Manguin, Edgard Maxence, Theodor Pallady, L\u00e9on Printemps, Georges Rouault, and Fernand Sabatt\u00e9.\n\"Here, during his last years, he displayed remarkable talents as a teacher\" Moreau's class quickly attracted the most progressive and adventurous students. As early as 1896 Roger-Marx wrote, \"The fires of insurrection have been lit in the very heart of the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts: all the rebels against routine all those who wish to develop in their own individual way, have gathered under the shield of Gustave Moreau, \" Moreau made no attempt to impose his own views or style on his students. He gave them a stimulating atmosphere and intelligent encouragement to follow their own ideas. He took his pupils to the Louver to study and copy the masters, unheard of at the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts: Matisse said \"It was an almost revolutionary attitude on his part to show us the way to the Museum\" Students were invited to his home on Sunday afternoons (but not allowed to see his studio) and occasionally he visited his students.\nYesterday at half past one I was walking along the embankment when I met Gustave Moreau, who like myself was on his way to see a good chum of mine, Henri Matisse, a delicate painter, skilful in the art of using grays. He suffers from violent neuralgia in his arm and can hardly walk. Somehow or other we reached the Quai Saint-Michel, where Matisse was strolling about, waiting for him. We made our way painfully up the stairs of that old house at No 19. There we were at last in the small studio full of torn wallpaper and knick-knacks, all gray with dust. Moreau said to me \"We are the jury.\" He sat down in an armchair, with me beside him, and we spent a delightful hour. He told us the whys and the wherefores of his likes and dislikes. Matisse showed us his entries for the Champs de Mars exhibition [i.e. Salon de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Nationale des Beaux-Arts], some ten canvases, with beautiful colors, practically all of them still lifes, and they provided the starting point for talk about everything connected with art, including music. Moreau has remained astonishingly young. There is nothing professorial about him, not a hint of pedantry. He is a friend.\" Henri Evenepoel\nGeorges Rouault said \"He was not a professor in the commonly accepted sense, but a man whom it did you good to emulate.\" Rouault was already a student when Moreau took the class and he soon recognized Rouault's exceptional talent and Rouault always held Moreau in the highest esteem. \"Half a century later Rouault, still spoke of him with the same veneration, with the same sympathy and cordiality, as if Moreau were still living, and as if Rouault himself were still a raw youth at the feet of a mentor whose judgments he trusted implicitly both in art and in life. Matisse said \"Gustave Moreau's great quality was to regard the mind of a young student as needing to develop continuously throughout his life, and not to push him to get through the various scholastic examinations.\" Matisse had been denied admission to the \u00c9cole des Beaux-Arts, but Moreau saw him drawing in the public courtyard of the school and invited him to join his class, exempting him from the entrance examination. Matisse soon became the central figure among a faction of students in Moreau's studio that developed into the fauvist. Albert Marquet said \"As early as 1898, Matisse and I were working in what was later to be called the fauve manner\", exemplified by \"Fauve Nude\", painted in Moreau's atelier. For decades his pupils credited the significance of their teacher, recalling his prophetic comments that were often taken to heart: \"the more elementary your means are, the more your sensibility shows through.\"; \"One must think color, one must have it in the imagination.\"; \"Nature in itself is nothing! It merely gives the artist an occasion to express himself. Art is the unflagging pursuit through plastic means of expression and inner feeling.\" \nMoreau's concerns for the fate of his life's work started in the 1860s, he began an inventory his paintings about 1884, and the death of Delaunay in 1891 exemplified what could become of an artist work after their death. Moreau arrived at the idea of leaving his house to the state as a museum and remodeled his townhome in 1895, expanding his small studio on the top floor into a much larger exhibition space. After about a year of declining health Moreau died of stomach cancer on 18 April 1898 and was buried at the Cimeti\u00e8re de Montmartre in Paris in his parent's tomb. He left instructions stipulating that his death was not to be announce in the press, his funeral was to be a very small, simple service, and any flowers were to be placed on the grave of Alexandrine Dureux, not his own. The government was hesitant to accept the estate, artist's house museums were very rare at that time and unprecedented in France. His assistant Henri Rupp was significant in organizing the estate and persuading the state to take it over.\nArt.\nI believe neither in what I touch nor in what I see and only in what I feel. My brain and my reason seem to be ephemeral and of dubious reality. My inner feeling alone appears to me eternal and unquestionably certain. Gustave Moreau\nExoticism.\nGustave Moreau's education in classical drawing did not stop him from experimenting with different styles of art. By traveling to other countries such as Italy or Holland and reading publications Moreau was able to develop his unique form of art. The most important publications Moreau owned were \"The Grammar of Ornament\" by Owen Jones, \"Le costume historique\" by August Racinet, and \"Le Costume\" by Frederick Hottenroth. All these influences led Moreau to draw not only humans, but animals and architectural monuments. Moreau started his career drawing classical art, but by incorporating exotic images he developed a mysterious and unique form of art.\nLegacy.\nDuring his lifetime, Moreau produced more than 15,000 paintings, watercolors and drawings. Due to his reluctance to sell his work, when he died he still owned 1,200 paintings and watercolors and 10,000 drawings which he left to the state. The Mus\u00e9e national Gustave Moreau at 14 rue de la Rochefoucauld (9th arrondissement), opened to the public on January 14, 1903, with his former student Georges Rouault appointed curator.\n \"A visionary like none other, he made the land of dreams his own, but from the madness of his dreams a sense of anguish and despair found its way into his works. A master sorcerer, he cast a spell over his period, enthralled his contemporaries, and brought a tinge of idealism to the skeptical and practical fin-de si\u00e8cle. Under the influence of his painting, a whole generation of young men have grown up doleful and languid, their eyes obstinately turned to the past and the magic of other days; a whole generation of men of letters, especially poets, have become nostalgically enamored of slender Salomes glittering with jewels, of Muses carrying blood drained severed heads.\" Jean Lorrain\nHis influence on symbolism in his lifetime and the decade following his death was tremendous. \"Gustave Moreau was the man of the moment. Aloof, independent, solitary, he yet became fashionable in high society and was taken up in masonic and occult circles.\" Art historian Jean Selz wrote \"He was a symbolist before the Symbolist and the most extraordinary of all of them.\" He influenced the next generation of Symbolists, particularly leading figures in Belgian Symbolism such as Jean Delville and Fernand Khnopff, and Odilon Redon in France. Redon said of his work \"Moreau, a bachelor, produced the work of an elegant bachelor, strictly sealed up against the shocks of life; his work is the fruit of it, it is art and nothing but art, and that is a saying a good deal.\"\nMany poets and writers of the day revered Moreau's paintings, Th\u00e9ophile Gautier, Joris-Karl Huysmans, St\u00e9phane Mallarm\u00e9, Paul de Saint-Victor, and Emile Zola all praised his work. It was a common practice at the time for poets to paraphrase in verse paintings they admired, and the paintings of Gustave Moreau were among the most lauded of the symbolist poets. Th\u00e9odore de Banville, Jos\u00e9 Maria de Heredia, Claudius Popelin, Jean Lorrain, Henri Cazalis, and others wrote of Moreau's work in poetry.\nInterest in his work remained fairly high in the first decade of the 20th century and occasional exhibitions of his paintings were held in the 15 years following his death. However, when the museum opened there was some disappointment in the audiences of the time in seeing the large numbers of drawings and unfinished paintings, and not a museum full of highly finished masterworks in oils, and attendance began to drop off after the opening. With the rise and prevalence of realism, impressionism and postimpressionism, followed by the onslaught of fauvism, cubism, futurism, expressionism, abstract art, and dada, Moreau (and most symbolist painting not realized in an expressionist style), appeared less relevant to modernism and was all but forgotten. After World War I, what little fame and notoriety Moreau had was largely related on his status as the teacher of Rouault and Matisse and the Fauvist. One of the only exhibitions in the 40 year period between 1918 and 1958 was a show held in Paris in 1926 centered around Moreau and his pupils.\nMoreau and surrealism.\nAndr\u00e9 Breton famously used to \"haunt\" the museum and regarded Moreau as a precursor of Surrealism. In his \"Manifesto of Surrealism\", he listed forerunners of the movement, poets and painters who \"could pass for Surrealist\", and included Moreau with Picasso, de Chirico, and a short list of other examples. Breton wrote in 1961: \"My discovery of the Gustave Moreau Museum in Paris when I was sixteen years old shaped my likes and loves for the rest of my life. It was there, in certain women's faces and figures, that I had the revelation of beauty and love.\" Georges Bataille wrote enthusiastically of his work calling him a precursor of surrealism. Salvador Dal\u00ed was also a great admirer of Moreau's work and a regular visitor to the Gustave Moreau Museum: \"To those I love, I recommend visiting the Museum, going and plunging into this twilight world where, risen from the gulf of erotic and scatological obsession, constellations of precious stones float like so many promises of archangelical redemption.\" It was at the Gustave Moreau Museum in 1970 where Dal\u00ed (holding a wax replica of his own head on a silver platter) chose to make the public announcement of his plans to open his own museum, Teatro-Museo Dal\u00ed, in Figueras, Spain. Max Ernst is known to have used reproductions of Moreau's work on occasion to create collages.\nAndre Breton advocated Gustave Moreau's work throughout his life, whenever he had the opportunity, in his writings, and introducing other writers and artist to the museum in Paris. At a time when Moreau and symbolism had largely drifted into obscurity, Breton sponsored a exhibition of symbolist drawings in Paris, at the Dateau-Lavoir Gallery in 1958. The exhibit has been identified as a significant event in re-establishing recognition of Moreau's work. It was a small \"over-confidential\" exhibition, but it succeeded in getting the attention of the right curators and in 1961, no less than the Louvre Museum and the Museum of Modern Art mounted exhibitions of Moreau's paintings, which in turn were followed by a landmark exhibition of symbolism, \"Le Groupe des XX et son temps\" in Brussels in 1962, and by the 1970s exhibitions and monographs on Moreau and symbolism were appearing with some regularity.\nThe Japanese artist Yoshitaka Amano, known for works such as \"Final Fantasy\", \"Angel's Egg\", and \"Vampire Hunter D\", was inspired by Moreau's style. Amano said in an interview that when he was first experimenting with styles to try to find his own, he would try to mimic the works of Moreau."}
{"title": "Lee_Krasner", "label": "Artist", "text": "Lenore \"Lee\" Krasner (born Lena Krassner on October 27, 1908 \u2013 June 19, 1984) was an American abstract expressionist painter, with a strong speciality in collage. She was married to Jackson Pollock. Although there was much cross-pollination between their two styles, the relationship somewhat overshadowed her contribution for some time. Krasner's training, influenced by George Bridgman and Hans Hofmann, was the more formalized, especially in the depiction of human anatomy, and this enriched Pollock's more intuitive and unstructured output.\nKrasner is now seen as a key transitional figure within abstraction, who connected early-20th-century art with the new ideas of postwar America, and her work fetches high prices at auction. She is also one of the few female artists to have had a retrospective show at the Museum of Modern Art.\nEarly life.\nKrasner was born as Lena Krassner (outside the family she was known as Lenore Krasner) on October 27, 1908 in Brooklyn, New York. She was the daughter of Chane (n\u00e9e Weiss) and Joseph Krasner, Russian-Jewish immigrants from Shpykiv, a Jewish community in what is now Ukraine. The couple fled to the United States to escape anti-Semitism and the Russo-Japanese War, and Chane changed her name to Anna once she arrived. Lee was the fourth of five children, including her sister, Ruth, and the only one to be born in the United States.\nEducation.\nFrom an early age, Krasner knew she wanted to pursue art as a career. Her career as an artist began when she was a teenager. She specifically sought out enrollment at Washington Irving High School for Girls as they offered an art major. After graduating, she attended the Women's Art School of Cooper Union on a scholarship. There, she completed the course work required for a teaching certificate in art. Krasner pursued yet more art education at the National Academy of Design in 1928, completing her course load there in 1932. When Krasner attended high school, she almost didn't graduate based on her grade in art, which was the subject she attended the school for, and was only given 65 to pass the class. \nBy attending a technical art school, Krasner was able to gain an extensive and thorough artistic education as illustrated through her knowledge of the techniques of the Old Masters. She also became highly skilled in portraying anatomically correct figures. There are relatively few works that survive from this time period apart from a few self-portraits and still lifes since most of the works were burned in a fire. One image that still exists from this period is her \"Self Portrait\" painted in 1930, now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She submitted it to the National Academy in order to enroll in a certain class, but the judges could not believe that the young artist produced a self-portrait en plein air. In it, Krasner depicts herself with a defiant expression surrounded by nature. She also briefly enrolled in the Art Students League of New York in 1928. There, she took a class led by George Bridgman who emphasized the human form.\nKrasner was highly influenced by the opening of the Museum of Modern Art in 1929. She was very affected by post-impressionism and grew critical of the academic notions of style she had learned at the National Academy. In the 1930s, she began studying modern art through learning the components of composition, technique, and theory. She began taking classes from Hans Hofmann in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and still life. He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the picture plane and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons. Throughout her classes with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism, also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human nude or a still life setting would be the model from which Krasner and other students would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings. She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors. The still lifes illustrated her interest in fauvism since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds.\nHans Hofmann \"was very negative\" his former student said \"but one day he stood before my easel and he gave me the first praise I had ever received as an artist from him. He said, 'This is so good, you would never know it was done by a woman\". She also received praise from Piet Mondrian who once told her \"You have a very strong inner rhythm; you must never lose it.\"\nEarly career.\nKrasner supported herself as a waitress during her studies but it eventually became too difficult due to the Great Depression. In order to continue provide for herself, she joined the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project in 1935, working in the mural division as an assistant to Max Spivak. Her job was to enlarge other artists' designs for large-scaled public murals. As murals were created to be easily understood and appreciated by the general public, however, the abstract art Krasner produced was undesirable. While happy to be employed, she was dissatisfied since she did not like working with figurative images created by other artists. Throughout the late 1930s and early 1940s, she created gouache sketches in the hopes of one day creating an abstract mural. As soon as one of her proposals for a mural was approved for the WNYC radio station, the Works Progress Administration turned into War Services and all art had to be created for war propaganda. Krasner continued working for War Services by creating collages for the war effort which were displayed in the windows of nineteen department stores in Brooklyn and Manhattan. She was intensively involved with the Artists Union during her employment with the WPA but was one of the first to quit when she realized the communists were taking it over. However, by being part of this organization, she was able to meet more artists in the city and enlarge her network.\nAfter she quit, she joined in 1940 the American Abstract Artists. While a member, she typically exhibited cubist still life in a black-gridded cloisonne style which were highly impastoed and gestural. She met future abstract expressionists Willem de Kooning, Arshile Gorky, Franz Kline, Adolph Gottlieb, Mark Rothko, Barnett Newman, Clyfford Still, and Bradley Walker Tomlin through this organization. She lost interest in their usage of hard-edge geometric style after her relationship with Jackson Pollock began.\nCareer.\nKrasner is identified as an abstract expressionist due to her abstract, gestural, and expressive works in painting, collage painting, charcoal drawing, and occasionally mosaics. She would often cut apart her own drawings and paintings to create her collage paintings. She also commonly revised or completely destroyed an entire series of works due to her critical nature; as a result, her surviving body of work is relatively small. Her catalogue raisonn\u00e9, published in 1995 by Abrams, lists 599 known pieces.\nHer changeable nature is reflected throughout her work, which has led critics and scholars to have different conclusions about her and her oeuvre. Krasner's style often alternates between classic structure and baroque action, open form and hard-edge shape, and bright color and monochrome palette. Throughout her career, she refused to adopt a singular, recognizable style and instead embraced change through varying the mood, subject matter, texture, materials, and compositions of her work often. By changing her work style often, she differed from other abstract expressionists since many of them adopted unchanging identities and modes of depiction. Despite these intense variations, her works can typically be recognized through their gestural style, texture, rhythm, and depiction of organic imagery. Krasner's interest in the self, nature, and modern life are themes which commonly surface in her works. She was often reluctant to discuss the iconography of her work and instead emphasized the importance of her biography since she claimed her art was formed through her individual personality and her emotional state.\nEarly 1940s.\nThroughout the first half of the 1940s, Krasner struggled with creating art that satisfied her critical nature. Throughout the 1930s the New York painting scene consisted of a very intimate group of artists that studied each other's efforts but was not yet shown in galleries. The 1940s marked a transition from an \"age of innocence\" to a modernist mindset of pure expression. She was highly affected by seeing Pollock's work for the first time in 1942, causing her to reject Hofmann's cubist style which required working from a human or still life model. She called the work produced during this frustrating time her \"grey slab paintings.\" She would create these paintings by working on a canvas for months, overpainting, scraping or rubbing paint off, and adding more pigment until the canvas was nearly monochrome from so much paint buildup. She eventually would destroy these works, which is the reason there is only one painting that exists from this time period. Krasner's extensive knowledge of cubism was the source of her creative problem since she needed her work to be more expressive and gestural to be considered contemporary and relevant. In the fall of 1945, Krasner destroyed many of her cubist works she created during her studies with Hofmann, although the majority of paintings created from 1938 to 1943 survived this reevaluation.\n\"Little Images:\" 1946\u20131949.\nBeginning in 1946, Krasner began working on her \"Little Image\" series. Commonly categorized as mosaic, webbed, or hieroglyphs depending on the style of the image, these types of paintings, totalling around 40, she created until 1949. The mosaic images were created through the thick buildup of paint while her webbed paintings were made through a drip technique in which the paintbrush was always close to the surface of the canvas. Since Krasner used a drip technique, many critics believed upon seeing this work for the first time that she was reinterpreting Pollock's chaotic paint splatters. Her hieroglyph paintings are gridded and look like an unreadable, personal script of Krasner's creation. These works demonstrate her anti-figurative concerns, allover approach to the canvas, gestural brushwork, and disregard of naturalistic color. They have little variation of hue but are very rich in texture due to the buildup of impasto and also suggest space continuing beyond the canvas. These are considered her first successful images that she created while working from her own imagination rather than a model. The relatively small scale of the images can be attributed to the fact she painted them on an easel in her small studio space in an upstairs bedroom at The Springs.\nMany scholars interpret these images as Krasner's reworking of Hebrew script. In an interview later in her career, Krasner admitted to subconsciously working from right to left on her canvases, leading scholars to believe that her ethnic and cultural background affected the rendering of her work. Some scholars have interpreted these paintings to represent the artist's reaction to the tragedy of the Holocaust. Others have claimed that Krasner's work with the War Services project caused her to be interested in text and codes since cryptoanalysis was a main concern for winning the war.\nWhen she completed the \"Little Image\" series in 1949, Krasner again went through a critical phase with her work. She tried out and rejected many new styles and eventually destroyed most of the work she made in the early 1950s. There is evidence that she began experimenting with automatic painting and created black-and-white, hybridized, monstrous figures on large canvases in 1950. These were the paintings that Betty Parsons saw when she visited The Springs that summer, causing the gallerist to offer Krasner a show in the fall. Between the summer and the fall, Krasner again had shifted her style to color field painting and destroyed the figurative automatic paintings she made. The Betty Parsons show was Krasner's first solo exhibition since 1945. After the exhibition, Krasner used the color field paintings to make her collage paintings.\nEarly collage images: 1951\u20131955.\nBy 1951, Krasner had started her first series of collage paintings. To create these them, Krasner pasted cut-and-torn shapes onto all but two of the large-scale color field paintings she created for the Betty Parsons exhibition in 1951. This period marks the time when the artist stopped working on an easel since she created these works by lying the support on the floor. To make these images, she would pin the separate pieces to a canvas and modify the composition until she was satisfied. She then would paste the fragments on the canvas and add color with a brush when desired. Most of the collage paintings she created recall plant or organic forms but do not completely resemble a living organism. By using many different materials, she was able to create texture and prevent the image from being entirely flat. The act of tearing and cutting elements for the collage embodies Krasner's expression since these acts are aggressive. She explored contrasts of light and dark colors, hard and soft lines, organic and geometric shapes, and structure and improvisation through this work. These collage paintings represent Krasner's turn away from nonobjective abstraction. From this period onwards, she created metaphorical and content-laden art which alludes to organic figures or landscapes.\nFrom 1951 to 1953, most of her works were made from ripped drawings completed in black ink or wash in a figurative manner. By ripping the paper instead of cutting it, the edges of the figures are much more soft in comparison to the geometric and hard-edged shapes in her previous works. From 1953 to 1954, she created smaller-sized collage paintings that were composed of fragments of undesired works. Some of the discarded works she used were splatter paintings completed by Pollock. Many scholars have expressed different interpretations about why she used her partner's unwanted canvases. Some assert that she simultaneously demonstrated her admiration for his art while also recontextualizing his aggressive physicality through manipulating his images into a collage form. Others believe that she was creating a sense of intimacy between themselves, which was lacking in their actual relationship by this time period, by combining their works together. By 1955, she made collage paintings on a larger scale and varied the material she used for the support, using either masonite, wood, or canvas. These works were first exhibited by Eleanor Ward at the Stable Gallery in 1955 in New York City, but they received little public acclaim apart from a good review from Clement Greenberg.\n\"Earth Green Series:\" 1956\u20131959.\nDuring the summer of 1956, Krasner started her \"Earth Green Series.\" While she started making this work before Pollock's death, they are considered to reflect her feelings of anger, guilt, pain, and loss she experienced about their relationship before and after he died. The intense emotion she felt during this time caused her art to develop along more liberated lines of her self-expression and pushed the boundaries of conventional, developed concepts of art. Through these large-scale action paintings, Krasner depicts hybridized figures that are made up of organic plant-like forms and anatomical parts, which often allude to both male and female body parts. These forms dominate the canvas, causing it to be crowded and densely-packed with bursting and bulging shapes. The pain she experienced during this period is illustrated through the principal usage of flesh tones with blood-red accents in the figures which suggest wounds. The paint drips on her canvas show her speed and willingness to relinquish absolute control, both necessary for portraying her emotions.\nBy 1957, Krasner continued to create figurative abstract forms in her work, but they suggest more floral elements rather than anatomical. She used brighter colors which were more vibrant and commonly contrasted other colors in the composition. She also would dilute paint or use a dry brush to make the colors more transparent.\nIn 1958, Krasner was commissioned to create two abstract murals for an office building on Broadway. She created two collage maquettes which depicted floral motifs for two entryways of the building. These murals were later destroyed in a fire.\n\"Umber Series:\" 1959\u20131961.\nKrasner's \"Umber Series\" paintings were created during a time when the artist was suffering from insomnia. Since she was working during the night, she had to paint with artificial light rather than daylight, causing her palette to shift from bright, vibrant hues to dull, monochrome colors. She also was still dealing with the death of Pollock and the recent death of her mother, which led her to use an aggressive style when creating these images. These mural-sized action paintings contrast dark and light severely since white, grays, black, and brown are the predominant colors used. Evidence of her animated brushwork can be seen through the drips and splatters of paint on the canvas. There is no central spot for the viewer to focus on in these works, making the composition highly dynamic and rhythmic. To paint on such a large scale, Krasner would tack the canvas to a wall. These images no longer implied organic forms but instead are often interpreted as violent and turbulent landscapes.\n\"Primary Series:\" 1960s.\nBy 1962, she begins using bright colors and allude to floral and plant-like shapes. These works are compositionally similar to her monochrome images due to their large size and rhythmic nature with no central focal point. Their palettes often contrast with one another and allude to tropical landscapes or plants. She continued working in this style until she suffered an aneurysm, fell, and broke her right wrist in 1963. Since she still wanted to work, she began painting with her left hand. To overcome working with her non-dominant hand, she often would directly apply paint from a tube to the canvas rather than using a brush, causing there to be large patches of white canvas on the surfaces of the images. The gesture and the physicality of these works is more restrained.\nAfter recovering from her broken arm, Krasner began working on bright and decorative allover painting which are less aggressive than her \"Earth Green\" and Umber Series paintings. Often, these images recall calligraphy or floral ornamentation not blatantly related to Krasner's known emotional state. Floral or calligraphic shapes dominate the canvas, connecting variable brushwork into a single pattern.\nBy the second half of the 1960s, critics began reassessing Krasner's role in the New York School as a painter and critic who greatly influenced Pollock and Greenberg. Prior to this, her status as an artist was typically overlooked by critics and scholars due to her relationship with Pollock. Since he served as such a large figure in the abstract expressionist movement, it is still often difficult for scholars to discuss her work without mentioning Pollock in some capacity. This reevaluation is reflected in her first retrospective exhibition of her paintings which was held in London at the Whitechapel Gallery in 1965. This exhibition was more well-received by critics in comparison to her previous shows in New York.\nIn 1969, Krasner mostly concentrated on creating works on paper with gouache. These works were named either \"Earth, Water, Seed,\" or \"Hieroglyphics\" and often looked similar to a Rorschach test. Some scholars claim that these images were a critique of Greenberg's theory about the importance of the two-dimensional nature of the canvas.\nLate career.\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s, the painter's work was significantly influenced by postmodern art and emphasized the inherent problems of art as a form of communication.\nStarting in 1970, Krasner began making large horizontal paintings made up of hard-edge lines and a palette of a few bright colors that contrasted one another. She painted in this style until about 1973. Three years later, she started working on her second series of collage images. She began working on these after cleaning out her studio and discovered some charcoal drawings mostly of figure studies that she completed from 1937 to 1940. After saving a few, Krasner decided to use the rest in a new series of collages. In this work, the black and gray shapes of the figure studies are juxtaposed against the blank canvas or the addition of brightly colored paint. The hard-edged shapes of the cut drawings are reconstructed into curvilinear shapes that recall floral patterns. Texture is induced through the contrast of the smooth paper and rough canvas. Since the figure studies are cut up and rearranged without consideration of their original intention or message, the differences between the old drawings and new structures are highly exaggerated. All of the collages' titles from this series are different verb tenses interpreted as a critique of Greenberg's and Michael Fried's insistence on the presentness of modern art. This series was very well received by a large audience when they were exhibited in 1977 at the Pace Gallery. It is also considered a statement about how artists need to reexamine and rework their style in order to stay relevant as they grow older.\nKrasner and Pollock's mutual influence on one another.\nAlthough many people believe that Krasner stopped working in the 1940s in order to nurture Pollock's home life and career, she never in fact stopped creating art. While their relationship developed, she shifted her focus from her own to Pollock's art in order to help him gain more recognition due to the fact that she believed that he had \"much more to give with his art than she had with hers\".\nThroughout her career, Krasner went through periods of struggle where she would experiment with new styles that would satisfy her means for expression and harshly critique, revise, or destroy the work she would produce. Because of this self-criticism, there are periods of time where little to none of her work exists, specifically the late 1940s and early 1950s.\nKrasner and Pollock both had an immense effect on each other's artistic styles and careers. Since Krasner had learned from Hans Hofmann while Pollock received training from Thomas Hart Benton, each took different approaches to their work. Krasner learned from Hofmann the importance of the abstracting from nature and emphasizing the flat nature of the canvas while Pollock's training highlighted the importance of complex design from automatic drawing. Krasner's extensive knowledge of modern art helped Pollock since she brought him up to date with what contemporary art should be. He was therefore able to make works that were more organized and cosmopolitan. Additionally, Krasner was responsible for introducing Pollock to many artists, collectors, and critics who appreciated abstract art such as Willem de Kooning, Peggy Guggenheim, and Clement Greenberg. Pollock helped Krasner become less restrained when making her work. He inspired her to stop painting from human and still life models in order to free her interior emotions and become more spontaneous and gestural through her work.\nKrasner struggled with the public's reception of her identity, both as a woman and as Pollock's wife. When they both exhibited in a show called \"Artists: Man and Wife\" in 1949, an \"ARTnews\" reviewer stated: \"There is a tendency among some of these wives to 'tidy up' their husband's styles. Lee Krasner (Mrs. Jackson Pollock) takes her husband's paint and enamels and changes his unrestrained, sweeping lines into neat little squares and triangles.\" Even after the rise of feminism in the 1960s and 1970s, Krasner's artistic career was always put into relation to Pollock since remarks made about her work often commented on how she had become a successful artist by moving out of Pollock's shadow. In articles about her work, Pollock is continually referred to. Krasner is still sometimes referred to as \"Action Widow\", a term coined in 1972 by art critic B. H. Friedman who accused the female surviving partners of Abstract Expressionist artists of artistic dependence on their male partners. Typically in the 1940s and 1950s, Krasner also would not sign works at all, sign with the genderless initials \"L.K.\", or blend her signature into the painting in order to not emphasize her status as a woman and as a wife to another painter.\nLegacy.\nMary Beth Edelson's \"Some Living American Women Artists / Last Supper\" (1972) appropriated Leonardo da Vinci\u2019s \"The Last Supper\", with the heads of notable women artists, including Krasner's, collaged over the heads of Christ and his apostles. The image, addressing the role of religious and art historical iconography in the subordination of women, became \"one of the most iconic images of the feminist art movement.\"\nKrasner died in 1984, age 75, from natural causes. She had been suffering from arthritis.\nSix months after her death, the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City held a retrospective exhibition of her work. A review in the \"New York Times\" noted that it \"clearly defines Krasner's place in the New York School\" and that she \"is a major, independent artist of the pioneer Abstract Expressionist generation, whose stirring work ranks high among that produced here in the last half-century.\" As of 2008, Krasner is one of only four women artists to have had a retrospective show at this institution. The other three women are Louise Bourgeois (1982), Helen Frankenthaler (1989) and Elizabeth Murray (2004).\nHer papers were donated to the Archives of American Art in 1985; they were digitized and posted on the web for researchers.\nAfter her death, her East Hampton property became the Pollock-Krasner House and Studio, and is open to the public for tours. A separate organization, the Pollock-Krasner Foundation, was established in 1985. The Foundation functions as the official estate for both Krasner and Pollock, and also, under the terms of her will, serves \"to assist individual working artists of merit with financial need.\" The U.S. copyright representative for the Pollock-Krasner Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.\nOn November 11, 2003, \"Celebration,\" a large painting from 1960 sold to the Cleveland Museum of Art for $1.9 million and in May 2008, \"Polar Stampede\" sold for $3.2 million. \"No one today could persist in calling her a peripheral talent,\" said critic Robert Hughes.\nIn popular culture.\nKrasner was portrayed by Marcia Gay Harden in the film \"Pollock\" (2000), which is about the life of her husband Jackson Pollock. Harden won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in the film.\nIn John Updike's novel \"Seek My Face\" (2002), a significant portion of the main character's life is based on Krasner's.\nPersonal life.\nRelationship with Jackson Pollock.\nKrasner and Jackson Pollock established a relationship in 1942 after they both exhibited at the McMillen Gallery. She was intrigued by his work and the fact she did not know who he was even though she knew many abstract painters in New York. She went to his apartment to meet him. By 1945, they moved to The Springs on the outskirts of East Hampton. In the summer of that year, they got married in a church with two witnesses.\nWhile the two lived in the farmhouse in The Springs, they continued creating art. They worked in separate studio spaces with Krasner in an upstairs bedroom in the house while Pollock worked in the barn in their backyard. When not working, the two spent their time cooking, baking, gardening, keeping the house organized, and entertaining friends.\nBy 1956, their relationship became strained as they faced certain issues. Pollock had begun struggling with his alcoholism and was having an extramarital affair with Ruth Kligman. Krasner left in the summertime to visit friends in Europe but had to quickly return when Pollock died in a car crash while she was away.\nReligion.\nKrasner was brought up in an orthodox Jewish home throughout her childhood and adolescence. Her family lived in Brownsville, Brooklyn which had a large population of poor Jewish immigrants. Her father spent most of his time practicing Judaism while her mother kept up the household and the family business. Krasner appreciated aspects of Judaism like Hebrew script, prayers, and religious stories.\nAs a teenager, she grew critical of what she perceived as misogyny in orthodox Judaism. In an interview later in her life, Krasner recalls reading a prayer translation and thinking it was \"indeed a beautiful prayer in every sense except for the closing of it... if you are a male you say, 'Thank You, O Lord, for creating me in Your image'; and if you are a woman you say, 'Thank You, O Lord, for creating me as You saw fit.'\" She also began reading existentialist philosophies during this time period, causing her to turn away from Judaism even further.\nWhile she married Pollock in a church, Krasner continued to identify herself as Jewish but decided to not practice the religion. Her identity as a Jewish woman has affected how scholars interpret the meaning of her art.\nSome institutional holdings.\nThe Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City\nThe Museum of Modern Art, New York City\nOther institutions:\nArt market.\nAt a 2003 Christie's auction in New York, Lee Krasner's horizontal composition in oil on canvas, \"Celebration\" (1960), multiplied its presale estimate more than fourfold as it ended its upward course at $1.9 million. In 2019, Sotheby's set a new auction record for Krasner when \"The Eye is the First Circle\" (1960) sold for $10 million to Robert Mnuchin."}
{"title": "Mahonri_Young", "label": "Artist", "text": "Mahonri Mackintosh Young (August 9, 1877 \u2013 November 2, 1957) was an American social-realist sculptor and artist. During his lengthy career, he created more than 320 sculptures, 590 oil paintings, 5,500 watercolors, 2,600 prints, and thousands of drawings. However, he is primarily recognized for his sculpture. His work includes landscapes, portraits, busts, life-size sculptures, monuments, and engravings. Regardless of his medium of choice, his work is characterized by spontaneity; he often preferred to prepare his work with quick sketches on the scene. He felt this made his work more natural as compared to using a model in the studio. He was fairly commercially successful during his life, though he did not find success until his mid-30s. Large commissions for sculptures from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) were particularly lucrative for him.\nBorn into a family of rich Mormon pioneer heritage, Young was the grandson of the second President of the LDS Church and first Governor of Utah, Brigham Young. Young was introduced to art by his father at an early age. He quit school at seventeen years old and worked engraving and portrait making jobs at various newspapers in Salt Lake City to make money for art lessons and for art school in New York and later, Paris. He lived most of his life in New York City where he became associated with \"The Eight\" and the Ashcan School. He ignited his commercial success in New York; however, arguably two of his most famous works, the This Is The Place Monument and the Seagull Monument are featured prominently in Salt Lake City, Utah. One of his other well-known works is a statue of Brigham Young which resides at the Statuary Hall at the United States Capitol Building in Washington, D.C. At various times during his career, Young taught at the Art Students League. Most of Young's work resides at Brigham Young University.\nEarly years.\nMahonri Mackintosh Young was born on August 9, 1877 in Salt Lake City, Utah Territory. He was the oldest child of Mahonri Moriancumer Young, owner of Deseret Woolen Mill which he had inherited from his father Brigham Young, and Agnes Mackintosh. Young enjoyed the time he spent living in rural Utah at the factory; he considered this his \"golden age\" in Utah. Young was given the name of his father, named after the character Mahonri Moriancumer from the Book of Mormon, widely known as the \"Brother of Jared\". Moriancumer was omitted due to its peculiarity and was, instead, replaced by Mackintosh, his mother's maiden name. His grandfather, Brigham Young, was the second president of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), governor of Utah territory in 1851, and director of the Mormon pioneers to Utah. Mahonri Mackintosh was likely the last grandchild born before the death of Brigham Young on August 29 and the last to receive a blessing from him.\nYoung's mother came from a polygamist marriage in the Midwestern United States. Though she did not meet her father, Daniel Mackintosh until she was older than one, he died when she was three years old and her mother raised her alone. Young's parents had attended the University of Deseret (now University of Utah) together. They married in October 1876 in the Endowment House in Salt Lake City. After their marriage, Agnes's mother Ellen moved into their home. Young's twin brothers, Winfield Scott (Winnie) and Waldemar (Wally) were born on July 1, 1880; they grew to be successful, a newspaperman and a screenwriter respectively. While ill with appendicitis, his father introduced Young to sculpture by carving objects for him out of wood. For his safety, his father gave him clay to model animals, sparking his interest in art at a young age. Young's father died when he was about seven years old. His father's death provided Young with the motivation to become a successful sculptor. His mother never remarried but was forced to sell the factory for less than half its worth due to financial concerns. Despite this, Agnes was able to provide for the living expenses of her family.\nHis family moved into a small house in Salt Lake City where Young began school. At eleven years old, his mother bought him a woodcarving kit from which he carved a four-inch bas relief of Julius Caesar from a fence post. After seeing the piece, a book salesman called him a \"genius\", leading his family to call him \"the genius\". Due to mediocre grades and always feeling behind his classmates, Young quit school after eighth grade. He spent time reading and studying about art, making friends with other young, aspiring artists. His childhood friends included John Held Jr. and Lee Greene Richards. He created his first sculpture when he was thirteen. At a young age, Young found formal education to be a waste of time. Young said that the only thing he learned that was of any value to him was that he should look at the point where a line would end rather than the point of the pencil. However, despite his disinterest in formal education, he read avidly with favorite authors being Ralph Waldo Emerson and Montaigne. Early influences from the Mormon families around him led him to be disinterested in maintaining LDS Church activity. Examples of these influences included abuse of the law of plural marriage and excessive piety among church members.\nYoung was athletic and participated in baseball and football teams. However, after an injury during a football game, he broke his left arm and after it was incorrectly reset and then rebroken to be properly set, his left arm remained slightly smaller than his right for the entirety of his life. His early interest in athletics influenced the subject of his art, as he often sculpted and depicted athletes competing in various sports, the most prominent sport being boxing. He also developed his interest in nature and bird watching which further influenced themes and subjects of his art. His uncle introduced Young to ranch life, in which he became extremely interested. His mother was adamant that he pursue a different career. Although Young did not become a rancher, themes of ranching and the American West were frequent in his art. Young learned about the art style of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet from reading magazines, which taught him about form, space, light, and movement in art. An article about Millet convinced Young to quit school, get a job, and take art lessons. Determined to become a sculptor, Young realized that he had not sculpted since he was five years old, so he decided he may have better luck being an illustrator.\nSalt Lake City and New York education.\nRather than attend ninth grade, Young chose to pursue an artistic education under local artist James Taylor Harwood, John Hafen, and Edwin Evans. He had initially applied to the University of Utah, but his application was denied because he had not graduated high school. Instead, Young worked in a curio shop and a stationary shop to make money for lessons with Harwood. However, he was delayed in attending lessons due to a necessary appendectomy. Harwood was unimpressed by Young, believing that he was a lazy artist and did not work hard. Young's philosophy, however, was that there is no virtue in working hard, but rather thinking hard. Furthermore, Young liked to quickly sketch an observation which he would later turn into a drawing, but being a traditionalist, Harwood viewed this technique as cheating and an \"artistic crime\". Although Young had not yet sculpted in class, one day, Young and a classmate sculpted the mask of \"Laoco\u00f6n\" with details from the \"David\" and \"Laughing Faun\". Young was not trained in sculpture and had not sculpted since he was five years old. Despite his lack of experience, his instructors praised his sculptures and his natural talent. However, he would not sculpt again until he studied in Paris. Young saved money earned as a \"Salt Lake Tribune\" portrait artist, but took his subsequent demotion to an engraver as a blow to his ego.\nUsing the money he saved, he attended the Art Students League of New York between 1899 and 1901. In New York, Young was fascinated by the Industrial Revolution and decided that he would make art to reflect the themes of the Industrial Revolution. At the Art Students League, Young took classes with George Bridgeman and Kenyon Cox. He began using realist techniques; he would look at artistic models quickly and then attempt to draw his or her memorized features. Although Young disliked Bridgeman as an instructor, Young maintained a spot as second in the class. In contrast, Young greatly admired Cox as an instructor. During his time in New York, he suffered from insomnia, which he attempting to remedy by reading Shakespeare and magazines. Young lived on a tight budget and spent most of his time studying or attending art exhibits. After running out of money, Young had to return to Salt Lake City after eight months instead of his intended nine.\nParis education.\nIn Salt Lake City, Young worked for the \"Salt Lake Herald\" as an engraver and did some drawings for \"Deseret News\". Even though he contracted the Spanish flu, Young became manager of the photoengraving shop for the \"Herald\" and saved enough money to travel to Paris, France in 1901 to study at the Acad\u00e9mie Julian. Young received extra money to study from his mother who had arranged for a settlement of a part of Brigham Young's estate as well as donations from family and members of the LDS Church.\nHe studied until 1905, where he studied with Jean-Paul Laurens and Jean-Antoine Injalbert. Unimpressed by the traditional styles taught in Paris, Young did not believe he learned anything at the Acad\u00e9mie in France until 1903, when he was able to work more independently and develop his realistic style. He started studying painting and after achieving personal goals painting and after more artistic education from a trip to Italy, he returned to studying sculpture and etching in 1903. Young indicated that one must learn to be thick skinned in class to be able to withstand the criticism of both professors and other students. Most of his instruction in anatomy came from independent study of books. He found that he could not stomach anatomy classes at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, not because of cadavers, because he had not yet made it to that point in the lectures, but because of the overwhelming stench of un-showered students and sweat which gave him unbearable headaches.\nYoung's most important etching in Paris was \"The Forge Rue St. Jacque\". It was exhibited in 1903, bringing public attention to Young's etchings. His first original sculptures, \"The Shoveler\" and \"The Man Tired\" were completed in 1903. Young did not agree with the use of models in his sculpting, because he believed it took away from the naturalness of the piece. For his sculptures, he found that sketches and observation over time made for more natural results and a better depiction of motion. He nervously sent \"Man Tired\" and \"The Shoveler\" to the American Art Association show in 1903 and achieved great success. His sculptures were featured in the \"Paris Herald\" in an article about the American Art Association show. His sculptures were sent to the New Salon in Paris for liberal art, were placed in the main gallery, and received critical acclaim. He spent all of his time looking at art in exhibitions or sketching on the street which garnered him criticism from his classmates for being lazy. Young, however, felt that he could learn more by observing rather than by working and studying in the studio.\nDuring the summer of 1903, Young returned to Salt Lake City, having run out of money. In Salt Lake City, Young continued to sketch. Fortunately for Young, his mother borrowed enough money for him to spend another two years studying in Paris. In New York, on his way to Paris, Young participated in an amateur boxing match and broke his thumb which prevented him from sculpting for a few months, so he attempted water coloring instead. He had some modeled drawings hung in the Paris Old Salon, which led him to experiment drawing with more models. His model \"Bovet-Arthur\" was displayed in the New Salon. Young frequently used this man Bovet-Arthur as a model for his work while he was in Paris. Young did a parody piece called \"The Toilet\", but it was never exhibited, and Young destroyed it in 1905. He destroyed some other work that was not accepted to salons. He later admitted regretting destroying his work and never destroyed another piece. Heber J. Grant, president of the LDS European Church mission at the time, gave Young money to cast some of Young's statues in bronze. During his last two years studying in France, he visited galleries and studios of well-known artists. Continuing to develop his style of realism, Mahonri Young was one of the first young American sculptural realists.\nCareer.\nMahonri Young returned to Utah in 1905, needing to find a way to make a living. Due to his lack of success and financial troubles, Young considered years 1905 to 1910 his \"five years of exile\". His first commission was a butter sculpture for Frost Creamery for the Utah State Fair called \"The Dairy Maid\". Later, Young established a mildly successful art class at the YMCA, but the class was canceled after one of his students started an art club that took away his students in 1906. He managed to maintain some private lessons. Young hoped to make a commission by making and selling a bust of B.H. Roberts, but he did not have money to bronze it until 1908. However, Robert's first wife refused to buy the bust because it did not adequately portray her husband's personality. Young finally received more commission when he and Lee Greene Richards completed a mural for the Isis Movie Theatre, using themselves as models for the characters. This was the first outside mural done in Utah and the only one done by Young. However, news stories about the murals kept being killed, leading Young to believe there was a conspiracy against realist artists. However, there were few career prospects in the United States, as the art scene was dominated by conservative juries who were unwilling to take a chance on unknown artists and were uninterested in unique or groundbreaking styles. Museums and exhibitionists wanted to showcase academic art and did not want to showcase American art. Consequently, Young found it difficult to sell or exhibit his work in the United States. He found little success during his first five years back in the United States. However, a group of realists called \"The Eight\" hosted an independent exhibition in 1908 in Philadelphia, igniting the success realist artists could find in the United States.\nYoung improved his reputation by making a bust of Alfred Lambourne. In early 1907, the LDS Church granted Mahonri Young permission to create a life-size sculpture of Joseph Smith, the first president of the LDS Church, using his death mask. After the LDS Church rejected his work, Young offered to redo the piece and make an additional statue of Hyrum Smith, Joseph Smith's brother. These statues were accepted and currently reside on Temple Square. Despite financial troubles, Young married Cecelia Sharp on February 19, 1907. Young had initially seen Sharp while both in Paris where Sharp had been studying piano; they had not yet met and Sharp had to travel back to Utah due to her father's health began to fail. In Utah, they attended the same LDS Church where Sharp's father was a bishop, but they had not yet met because Sharp was five years older than Young. Young and Sharp met in 1906 while Sharp was giving private piano lessons in Salt Lake City and fell in love. Young made a bust of Sharp in 1906. Polished and beautiful, the bust was different than anything he created during his career.\nYoung and Sharp's first child, Cecelia Agnes Young, known as \"Agnes\" or \"Aggie\", was born on April 25, 1908. Continually aware of the revolt of \"The Eight\", Young traveled to New York in 1908 and 1909 to determine whether he could be successful in New York. After he presented an idea to construct a \"Seagull Monument\" to the LDS Church, they were excited about the project, but were unable to fund it. He instead sculpted a frieze to go above the LDS Gymnasium. This was the last project he completed in Utah before he moved to New York. Young felt that he could relate to the styles and the goals of \"The Eight\", so he and his family moved to New York in 1910. In New York, Young was a founding member of the Society of American Etchers. He did not find success until 1912, which was a turning point in his career. In 1911, Young won the Helen Foster Barnett prize for \"Bovet-Arthur a Laborer\", displayed at the National Academy. His first New York exhibition was held in 1912. \"Stevedore\" was shown at the Metropolitan Museum in New York. In the same year, Young was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Associate. Moreover, in 1912, Young proposed the \"Seagull Monument\" to the LDS Church a second time, stressing the personal importance of the monument to Presiding Bishop of the LDS Church Charles W. Nibley. The LDS Church offered Young a contract for the completion of the \"Seagull Monument\", offering him a $200 per month advance for his living expenses. Mahonri \"Bill\" Sharp Young was born on July 23, 1911, in New York.\nFollowing the Seagull contract, Young was offered a contract to create art for a Hopi Indian exhibition for the American Museum of Natural History. He visited Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah to get inspiration and then returned to New York to complete the project with his colleague Howard MacCormick. Young was offered some commission to create dioramas for Navajo and Apache tribes as well. The \"Seagull Monument\" was unveiled and dedicated on Temple Square on October 1, 1913. A member of the Association of American Painters and Sculptors and because of the similar artistic goals and interests, Young became friends with some members of the Ashcan School and joined them in arranging the 1913 Armory show, which sought to introduce patrons to new styles and movements in art. The Armory show included realism and introduced more abstract styles such as Cubism. Young disliked abstract art styles. In fact, Young believed the emerging styles of surrealism and abstract expressionism that began to appear later in his life were \"a greater threat than Communism\". In 1915 Young became a member of The Brooklyn Society of Etchers (Today known as the Society of American Graphic Artists or SAGA). The Society's objective was, as it is today, to advance the fine works of American etchers. Young's six etchings, \"Noon\", \"Ensign Peak\", \"The Main Digger\" (which was listed for $18), \"Kite Fliers\", \"Pavers\" and \"The Sand Pit\" were all exhibited at The Brooklyn Society of Etcher's first exhibition at the Brooklyn Museum, NY in 1916. Also in 1915, he featured nine pieces at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition where he was awarded the silver medal. Young's Apache sculptures were unveiled at the American Museum of Natural History in 1916. Cecelia Sharp died of cancer in 1917 after which Young returned to Paris to continue studying art. He resided in Paris from 1925 to 1927. In Paris, he taught students, one of whom was Mary Tarleton. Tarleton and Young maintained a romantic relationship for a few years. Tarleton, 27 years his junior, confessed her love to Young but refused his many marriage proposals. Their relationship and consistent correspondence came to an end in 1930. In 1923, Young was elected to the National Academy of Design as an Academician. In 1924, Young unveiled his Navajo statues at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.\nIn 1926, E. W. Marland commissioned a statue of a pioneer woman; he invited twelve artists to submit sculptures to be considered for the monument. Young submitted a sculpture but lost to Bryant Baker. Young considered this the greatest disappointment of his career. Young's statues of Prize Ring boxer bronzes were shown at the Rehn Galleries in New York in 1928, their first exhibition. In 1929, Young crafted a bronze of Joe Gans for Winfield Sheehan, a Fox Film executive at the time. Young married Dorothy Weir, daughter of painter J. Alden Weir on February 17, 1931 and promptly moved to the Weir family farm in Connecticut. Young maintained a studio at the Weir estate which has become Weir Farm National Historic Site. Young first met Weir at 1921 at a dinner to discuss plans for the Phillips Memorial Gallery, one of the books for the gallery was intended to be dedicated to Weir's father. When Young returned to Paris to teach and work on his art from 1925 to 1927, they were reacquainted and became friends. After returning to New York, Young proposed marriage to Weir a few times, but she hesitated having never been married and feeling responsibility to care for her aging stepmother.\nIn 1932, Young competed in the Art competitions at the 1932 Summer Olympics with eight boxing statues. \"The Knockdown\", which he had sculpted in the 1920s in Paris, won the gold medal for sculpture. In 1934, he began teaching at the Art Students League. The same year, his etching \"Pont Neuf\" was featured in \"Fine Prints of the Year\", 1933. In 1941 Life magazine called him \"the George Bellows of American sculpture.\" \"Industry\" and \"Agriculture\", a statue of factory worker with tools and a statue of a farmer sharpening his blade, were displayed at the 1939 New York World's Fair. These large sculptures stood at the fair's entrance.\n\"This is the Place Monument\".\nMahonri Young had a unique relationship with the LDS Church. Since his teenage years, he did not attend church, follow the Word of Wisdom, or pay tithing to the LDS Church. However, he did admire several LDS Church leaders and was proud of his pioneer heritage. Despite his lack of activity in the LDS Church, he lobbied heavily to work on several projects for the church. Largely considered to be his most important artistic work, Young was especially proud of \"This Is The Place\" Monument located at This Is the Place Heritage Park in the foothills of Salt Lake City. The most artistically significant relief on the monument depicts the Donner Party. The monument was intended to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Brigham Young and the Mormons' arrival in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. As early as 1935, a committee had been chosen to consider artists' proposals of the monument. Young did extensive research and sketching for the project, confident he would be awarded the chance to create the monument. After lobbying the committee for almost five months, he returned to New York, frustrated that he had not yet secured the project. He decided to lobby U.S. senators from Utah to gained federal funding for the project which offended committee member John D. Giles. Giles told Young that he could not give him a contract because they were waiting on funding from the LDS Church; however, Giles was actually stalling time to find a different artist to complete the project. The committee decided to make the monument proposal a competition, which worried Young because of his experience with the Pioneer Woman Competition. John Fairbanks, a younger artist, had already completed prominent statues and memorials for the LDS Church; he was Young's fiercest competition. LDS President Heber J. Grant chose Young's design in 1939, because it highlighted prominent figures Brigham Young, Heber C. Kimball, and Wilford Woodruff rather than a covered wagon, as in the Fairbanks design.\nYoung was awarded $50,000 to build the monument in 1939 when he was 62 years old. After he was granted the contract, many of the artistic qualities sought by Young were vetoed by representatives from Utah state government, the LDS Church, and descendants of pioneers. For example, Young wanted pioneer leaders in realistic clothing like they would have worn when entering the Salt Lake Valley on July 24, 1847. However, Young's vision of leaders like Brigham Young and Heber C. Kimball in suspenders and bloomers was deemed undignified. Instead, pioneer leaders were portrayed in heavy formal overcoats. Young worked on the statues at Weir farm, assisted by Spero Anargyros. The monument was dedicated on July 24, 1947, on the one-hundredth anniversary of Brigham Young's party reaching the Great Salt Lake Valley. It is the largest sculpted monument in Utah. Even though Young was paid $50,000 for the monument, he believed that he was owed $11,000 extra according to the terms of the contract. He was angry when he was denied the money and eventually became frustrated enough to write to the president of the LDS Church George A. Smith directly. George Q. Morris of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles severely reprimanded Young for contacting Smith and Young was never paid the extra $11,000. Young resented this alleged contract breach for the rest of his life.\nIn 1947, Young was elected a member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters. Dorothy Weir died on May 28, 1947. Young continued to live there after her death. His last major work was for the State of Utah. He created a six-foot monument of Brigham Young seated for the Statuary Hall in the United States Capitol Building. The work was unveiled in Washington D.C. in 1950. He carved this work at the American Academy in Rome, Italy. During a visit to Utah in the same year, he was made an honorary member of the Sons of Utah Pioneers Club. In 1955, Young participated in the Armory Show Commemorative Exhibition in New York City. In January 1957, Young had a serious stroke and in October 1957, he had an ulcer attack. Young died in Norwalk, Connecticut on November 2, 1957, from the result of bleeding ulcers complicated by pneumonia; he was eighty years old. He was buried in the Salt Lake City Cemetery at the Young family plot, next to Cecelia Young.\nStyle and works.\nAlthough Mahonri Young was taught the classical style which prevailed in the French art institutes of the time, and was surrounded by colleagues who sought to reject the classical style with impressionistic and post-impressionistic styles, Young was disinterested in depicting idyllic or naturalistic images and was more concerned with depicting the realities of life that surrounded him. Consequently, Young's work is often associated with social realism, as his work depicted laborers, immigrants, minorities, the West, and man's interaction with nature. At the time, Young felt isolated by his traditionalist instructors and colleagues who penned Young's work as \"dishonest\". The size of his work ranged from larger monuments to small sculptures which he typically did in the social realist style. His most recurring subject matter included animals, Native Americans, the boxing ring, ranch life, and laborers. Young greatly admired the work of Cyrus Dallin and Young's work often had parallels to that of Dallin's.\nMahonri Young was versatile in his subject matter and methods, yet his works were united in \"powerful elegance\". He was proficient in various mediums and techniques such as etching, drawing, watercolor, oil, gouache, and sculpture, which included his lesser known work on medals and reliefs. Even though he is known for his sculpture, he always kept a sketchbook with him and would use pen and ink, oil, and watercolor to depict scenes he saw on the farm. However while art critic, Frank Jewett Mather praised Young's drawings, etchings, and sculpture, he qualified Young's painting as average, suggesting that Young may have commenced painting at too old of an age or perhaps did not approach it with the same effort and care with which he approached his other mediums. Additionally, compared Young's work to that of Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Millet, Honor\u00e9 Daumier, and Constantin Meunier. Though Young vehemently denied it, some critics accused Young of imitating Millet's work. Young's work, particularly his earlier pieces, was also heavily influenced by Auguste Rodin. Young's sculpture of fighting boxers, \"Right to the Jaw\" is characteristic of Rodin's style with its curves and opposing diagonal movements. Young's experience as a sketch artist for the \"Salt Lake Tribune\" gave him a spontaneous style that he believed benefited his art. Young excelled in \"depicting figures in motion\" and \"the psychological nuances of gesture\". Rather than emphasize light, appearance, and technical skill as had prevailed in traditionalist art, Young preferred to emphasize rhythm, balance, movement, form, and design.\nLegacy.\nMahonri Young's career lasted more than fifty years with his works displayed in over fifty museums and galleries in the United States and Europe. Upon his death, his estate constituted 320 pieces of sculpture, 590 oil paintings, 5,500 watercolors, 2,600 prints, and thousands of drawings. Young was the first Utah artist to have his work displayed in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Moreover, Young received nearly every award offered to artists in Utah. The Springville Museum of Art called Young \"Utah's most famous New York-based artist\". According to the \"Encyclopedia of Mormonism\", Young gained a national reputation for his sculpture and graphic art. Guy P\u00e8ne du Bois said, \"Mahonri Young belongs among...those who of the strain of Michelangelo, Titian, Rubens, Goya, Renoir, and Millet...he is a rare sculptor in America\". Young was a member of the American Watercolor Society. In 1940, the Addison Gallery of American Art hosted a retrospective exhibit of Young's various works. In 1999, the Brigham Young University Museum of Art in Provo, Utah opened a year-long exhibition of Mahonri Young's work called \"Mahonri: A Song of Joys\". The Young family donated over 7,000 various works of Young to Brigham Young University. Additionally, the BYU Museum of Art held an exhibition of Young's work during summer 2019."}
{"title": "David_Hockney", "label": "Artist", "text": "David Hockney (born 9 July 1937) is an English painter, draftsman, printmaker, stage designer, and photographer. As an important contributor to the pop art movement of the 1960s, he is considered one of the most influential British artists of the 20th century.\nHockney has owned residences and studios in Bridlington, London and Normandy, as well as two residences in California, where he has lived intermittently since 1964: one in the Hollywood Hills, one in Malibu, and an office and archives on Santa Monica Boulevard in West Hollywood, California.\nOn 15 November 2018, Hockney's 1972 work \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" sold at Christie's auction house in New York City for $90 million (\u00a370 million), becoming the most expensive artwork by a living artist sold at auction. This broke the previous record, set by the 2013 sale of Jeff Koons' \"Balloon Dog (Orange)\" for $58.4 million. Hockney held this record until 15 May 2019 when Koons reclaimed the honour selling his \"Rabbit\" for more than $91 million at Christie's in New York.\nBiography.\nDavid Hockney was born in Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, England, to Laura and Kenneth Hockney (a conscientious objector in the Second World War), the fourth of five children. He was educated at Wellington Primary School, Bradford Grammar School, Bradford College of Art (where his teachers included Frank Lisle and his fellow students included Derek Boshier, Pauline Boty, Norman Stevens, David Oxtoby and John Loker) and the Royal College of Art in London, where he met R. B. Kitaj. While there, Hockney said he felt at home and took pride in his work.\nAt the Royal College of Art, Hockney featured in the exhibition \"Young Contemporaries\" \u2013 alongside Peter Blake \u2013 that announced the arrival of British Pop art. He was associated with the movement, but his early works display expressionist elements, similar to some works by Francis Bacon. When the RCA said it would not let him graduate if he did not complete an assignment of a life drawing of a female model in 1962, Hockney painted \"Life Painting for a Diploma\" in protest. He had refused to write an essay required for the final examination, saying he should be assessed solely on his artworks. Recognising his talent and growing reputation, the RCA changed its regulations and awarded the diploma. After leaving the RCA, he taught at Maidstone College of Art for a short time. He taught at the University of Iowa in 1964.\nHockney moved to Los Angeles in 1964, where he was inspired to make a series of paintings of swimming pools in the comparatively new acrylic medium using vibrant colours. The artist lived back and forth among Los Angeles, London, and Paris in the late 1960s to 1970s. In 1974 he began a decade-long personal relationship with Gregory Evans who moved with him to the US in 1976 and as of 2019 remains a business partner. In 1978 he rented a house in the Hollywood Hills, and later bought and expanded it to include his studio. He also owned a 1,643-square-foot beach house at 21039 Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, which he sold in 1999 for around $1.5\u00a0million.\nIn Spring 2019 Hockney settled at La Grande Cour, a farmhouse and studio in Normandy, where he was resident during the global COVID-19 pandemic.\nWork.\nHockney has experimented with painting, drawing, printmaking, watercolours, photography, and many other media including a fax machine, paper pulp, computer applications and iPad drawing programs. The subject matter of interest ranges from still lifes to landscapes, portraits of friends, his dogs, and stage designs for the Royal Court Theatre, Glyndebourne, and the Metropolitan Opera in New York City.\nPortraits.\nHockney has always returned to painting portraits throughout his career. From 1968, and for the next few years, he painted portraits and double portraits of friends, lovers, and relatives just under life-size in a realistic style that adroitly captured the likenesses of his subjects. Hockney has repeatedly been drawn to the same subjects \u2013 his family, employees, artists Mo McDermott and Maurice Payne, various writers he has known, fashion designers Celia Birtwell and Ossie Clark (\"Mr. and Mrs. Clark and Percy\", 1970\u201371), curator Henry Geldzahler, art dealer Nicholas Wilder, George Lawson and his ballet dancer lover, Wayne Sleep, and also his romantic interests throughout the years including Peter Schlesinger and Gregory Evans. Perhaps more than all of these, Hockney has turned to his own figure year after year, creating over 300 self-portraits.\nFrom 1999 to 2001 Hockney used a camera lucida for his research into art history as well as his own work in the studio. He created over 200 drawings of friends, family, and himself using this antique lens-based device.\nIn 2016, the Royal Academy exhibited Hockney's series entitled \"82 Portraits and 1 Still-life\" which traveled to Ca' Pesaro in Venice, Italy, and the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao, in 2017 and to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 2018. Hockney calls the paintings started in 2013 \"twenty-hour exposures\" because each sitting took six to seven hours on three consecutive days.\nPrintmaking.\nHockney experimented with printmaking as early as a lithograph \"Self-Portrait\" in 1954 and worked in etchings during his time at RCA. In 1965, the print workshop Gemini G.E.L. approached him to create a series of lithographs with a Los Angeles theme. Hockney responded by creating \"The Hollywood Collection\", a series of lithographs recreating the art collection of a Hollywood star, each piece depicting an imagined work of art within a frame. Hockney went on to produce many other portfolios with Gemini G.E.L. including \"Friends, The Weather Series,\" and \"Some New Prints\". During the 1960s he produced several series of prints he thought of as 'graphic tales', including \"A Rake\u2019s Progress\" (1961\u201363) after Hogarth, \"Illustrations for Fourteen Poems from C.P. Cavafy\" (1966) and \"Illustrations for Six Fairy Tales from the Brothers Grimm\" (1969).\nIn 1973 Hockney began a fruitful collaboration with Aldo Crommelynck, Picasso's preferred printer. In his atelier, he adopted Crommelynck's trademark sugar lift, as well as a system of the master's own devising of imposing a wooden frame onto the plate to ensure color separation. Their early work together included \"Artist and Model\" (1973\u201374) and \"Contrejour in the French Style\" (1974). In 1976 Hockney created a portfolio of 20 etchings at Crommelynck's atelier, \"The Blue Guitar: Etchings By David Hockney Who Was Inspired By Wallace Stevens Who Was Inspired By Pablo Picasso\". The etchings refer to themes in a poem by Wallace Stevens, \"The Man with the Blue Guitar\". It was published by Petersburg Press in October 1977. That year, Petersburg also published a book, in which the images were accompanied by the poem's text.\nIn the summer of 1978, David Hockney stayed 6 weeks with his friend the printer Ken Tyler. Tyler invited Hockney to try a new technique with liquid paper. The process is painting with the paper itself, so the artist had to do it himself by hand. Each image becomes a unique work between printmaking and painting. In 6 weeks, Hockney created a total of 29 artworks with a series of 17 sunflowers and swimming pools.\nSome of Hockney's other print portfolios include \"Home Made Prints\" (1986), \"Recent Etchings\" (1998) and \"Moving Focus\" (1984\u20131986), which contains lithographs related to \"A Walk Around the Hotel Courtyard, Acatlan.\" A retrospective of his prints, including 'computer drawings' printed on fax machines and inkjet printers, was exhibited at Dulwich Picture Gallery in London 5 February \u2013 11 May 2014 and Bowes Museum, County Durham 7 June \u2013 28 September 2014, with an accompanying publication \"Hockney, Printmaker\" by Richard Lloyd.\nPhotocollages.\nIn the early 1980s, Hockney began to produce photo collages\u2014which in his early explorations within his personal photo albums he referred to as \"joiners\"\u2014first using Polaroid prints and subsequently 35mm, commercially processed colour prints. Using Polaroid snaps or photolab-prints of a single subject, Hockney arranged a patchwork to make a composite image. Because the photographs are taken from different perspectives and at slightly different times, the result is work that has an affinity with Cubism, one of Hockney's major aims\u2014discussing the way human vision works. Some pieces are landscapes, such as \"Pearblossom Highway #2\", others portraits, such as \"Kasmin 1982,\" and \"My Mother, Bolton Abbey, 1982.\"\nCreation of the \"joiners\" occurred accidentally. He noticed in the late sixties that photographers were using cameras with wide-angle lenses. He did not like these photographs because they looked somewhat distorted. While working on a painting of a living room and terrace in Los Angeles, he took Polaroid shots of the living room and glued them together, not intending for them to be a composition on their own. On looking at the final composition, he realised it created a narrative, as if the viewer moved through the room. He began to work more with photography after this discovery and stopped painting for a while to exclusively pursue this new technique.\nOver time, however, he discovered what he could \"not\" capture with a lens, saying: \"Photography seems to be rather good at portraiture, or can be. But, it can't tell you about space, which is the essence of landscape. For me anyway. Even Ansel Adams can't quite prepare you for what Yosemite looks like when you go through that tunnel and you come out the other side.\" Frustrated with the limitations of photography and its 'one-eyed' approach, he returned to painting.\nOther technology.\nIn December 1985 Hockney used the Quantel Paintbox, a computer program that allowed the artist to sketch directly onto the screen. The resulting work was featured in a BBC series that profiled several artists. In 1999\u20132001, David's sister, Margaret, began experimenting with digital photography, scanning and computer printing, particularly making images of flowers scanning a small Japanese vase and fresh flowers. In 2003, she was experimenting with Photoshop, scanning summer flowers and building up images in layers which Margaret printed out on an A3 printer. In 2004, David went to stay with Margaret and she helped him scan his sketchbook of Yorkshire landscape and David soon began using a Wacom pad and pen directly into Photoshop.\nSince 2009, Hockney has painted hundreds of portraits, still lifes and landscapes using the Brushes iPhone and iPad application, often sending them to his friends. In 2010 and 2011, Hockney visited Yosemite National Park to draw its landscape on his iPad. He used an iPad in designing a stained glass window at Westminster Abbey which celebrated the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. Unveiled in September 2018, the Queen's Window is located in the north transept of the Abbey and features a hawthorn blossom scene which is set in Yorkshire.\nFrom 2010 to 2014, Hockney created multi-camera movies using three to eighteen cameras to record a single scene. He filmed the landscape of Yorkshire in various seasons, jugglers and dancers, and his own exhibitions within the de Young Museum and the Royal Academy of Arts.\nHockney's earlier photocollages influenced his shift to another medium, digital photography. He combined hundreds of photographs to create multi-viewpoint \"photographic drawings\" of groups of his friends in 2014. Hockney picked the process back up in 2017, this time using the more advanced Agisoft PhotoScan photogrammetric software which allowed him to stitch together and rearrange thousands of photos. The resulting images were printed out as massive photomurals and were exhibited at Pace Gallery and LACMA in 2018.\nPlein air landscapes.\nHockney returned more frequently to Yorkshire in the 1990s, usually every three months, to visit his mother who died in 1999. He rarely stayed for more than two weeks until 1997, when his friend Jonathan Silver who was terminally ill encouraged him to capture the local surroundings. He did this at first with paintings based on memory, some from his boyhood. In 1998, he completed the painting of the Yorkshire landmark, Garrowby Hill. Hockney returned to Yorkshire for longer and longer stays, and by 2003 was painting the countryside en plein air in both oils and watercolor. He set up residence and studio in a converted bed and breakfast, in the seaside town of Bridlington, about from where he was born. The oil paintings he produced after 2005 were influenced by his intensive studies in watercolour, a series titled \"Midsummer: East Yorkshire\" (2003\u20132004). He created paintings made of multiple smaller canvases\u2014two to fifty\u2014placed together. To help him visualize work at that scale, he used digital photographic reproductions to study the day's work.\nIn June 2007, Hockney's largest painting, \"Bigger Trees Near Warter or/ou Peinture sur le Motif pour le Nouvel Age Post-Photographique\", which measures , was hung in the Royal Academy's largest gallery in its annual Summer Exhibition. This work \"is a monumental-scale view of a coppice in Hockney's native Yorkshire, between Bridlington and York. It was painted on 50 individual canvases, mostly working in situ, over five weeks last winter.\" In 2008, he donated it to Tate in London, saying: \"I thought if I'm going to give something to the Tate I want to give them something really good. It's going to be here for a while. I don't want to give things I'm not too proud of... I thought this was a good painting because it's of England... it seems like a good thing to do.\" The painting was the subject of a BBC1 Imagine film documentary by Bruno Wollheim called \"David Hockney: A Bigger Picture\" (2009) which followed Hockney as he worked outdoors over the preceding two years.\nHis residence in Normandy from 2019 was intended for him to paint the local landscape, which he has done prolifically using both paint and iPad.\nTheatre works.\nHockney's first stage designs were for \"Ubu Roi\" at London's Royal Court Theatre in 1966, Stravinsky's \"The Rake's Progress\" at the Glyndebourne Festival Opera in England in 1975, and \"The Magic Flute\" for Glyndebourne in 1978. In 1980, he agreed to design sets and costumes for a 20th-century French triple bill at the Metropolitan Opera House with the title \"Parade.\" The works were \"Parade\", a ballet with music by Erik Satie; \"Les mamelles de Tir\u00e9sias\", an opera with libretto by Guillaume Apollinaire and music by Francis Poulenc, and \"L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges\", an opera with libretto by Colette and music by Maurice Ravel. The reimagined set of \"L'enfant et les sortil\u00e8ges\" from the 1983 exhibition \"Hockney Paints the Stage\" is a permanent installation at the Spalding House branch of the Honolulu Museum of Art. He designed sets for another triple bill of Stravinsky's \"Le sacre du printemps, Le rossignol,\" and \"Oedipus Rex\" for the Metropolitan Opera in 1981 as well as Richard Wagner's \"Tristan und Isolde\" for the Los Angeles Music Center Opera in 1987, Puccini's \"Turandot\" in 1991 at the Chicago Lyric Opera, and Richard Strauss's \"Die Frau ohne Schatten\" in 1992 at the Royal Opera House in London. In 1994, he designed costumes and scenery for twelve opera arias for the TV broadcast of Pl\u00e1cido Domingo's \"Operalia\" in Mexico City. Technical advances allowed him to become increasingly complex in model-making. At his studio he had a proscenium opening by in which he built sets in 1:8 scale. He also used a computerised setup that let him punch in and program lighting cues at will and synchronise them to a soundtrack of the music.\nIn 2017, Hockney was awarded the San Francisco Opera Medal on the occasion of the revival and restoration of his production for \"Turandot\".\nThe majority of Hockney's theater works and stage design studies are found in the collection of The David Hockney Foundation.\nExhibitions.\nDavid Hockney has been featured in over 400 solo exhibitions and over 500 group exhibitions. He had his first one-man show at Kasmin Limited when he was 26 in 1963, and by 1970 the Whitechapel Gallery in London had organised the first of several major retrospectives, which subsequently travelled to three European institutions. LACMA also hosted a retrospective exhibition in 1988 which travelled to The Met, New York, and Tate, London. In 2004, he was included in the cross-generational Whitney Biennial, where his portraits appeared in a gallery with those of a younger artist he had inspired, Elizabeth Peyton.\nIn October 2006, the National Portrait Gallery in London organised one of the largest ever displays of Hockney's portraiture work, including 150 paintings, drawings, prints, sketchbooks, and photocollages from over five decades. The collection ranged from his earliest self-portraits to work he completed in 2005. Hockney assisted in displaying the works and the exhibition, which ran until January 2007, was one of the gallery's most successful. In 2009, \"David Hockney: Just Nature\" attracted some 100,000 visitors at the Kunsthalle W\u00fcrth in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall, Germany.\nFrom 21 January 2012 to 9 April 2012, the Royal Academy presented , which included more than 150 works, many of which take entire walls in the gallery's brightly lit rooms. The exhibition is dedicated to landscapes, especially trees and tree tunnels of his native Yorkshire. Works included oil paintings, watercolours, and drawings created on an iPad and printed on paper. Hockney said, in a 2012 interview, \"It's about big things. You can make paintings bigger. We're also making photographs bigger, videos bigger, all to do with drawing.\" The exhibition drew more than 600,000 visitors in under 3 months. The exhibition moved to the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain from 15 May to 30 September, and from there to the Ludwig Museum in Cologne, Germany, between 27 October 2012 and 3 February 2013.\nFrom 26 October 2013 to 30 January 2014 \"David Hockney: A Bigger Exhibition\" was presented at the de Young Museum, one of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco. The largest solo exhibition Hockney has had, with 397 works of art in more than 18,000 square feet, was curated by Gregory Evans and included the only public showing of \"The Great Wall\", developed during research for \"Secret Knowledge\", and works from 1999 to 2013 in a variety of media from camera lucida drawings to watercolors, oil paintings, and digital works.\nFrom 9 February to 29 May 2017 \"David Hockney\" was presented at the Tate Britain, becoming the gallery's most visited exhibition ever. The exhibition marked Hockney's 80th year and gathered together \"an extensive selection of David Hockney\u2019s most famous works celebrating his achievements in painting, drawing, print, photography and video across six decades\". The show then traveled to Centre Georges Pompidou in Paris and The Metropolitan Museum of Art. The wildly popular retrospective landed among the top ten ticketed exhibitions in London and Paris for 2017 with over 4,000 visitors per day at the Tate and over 5,000 visitors per day in Paris.\nAfter the blockbuster exhibitions in 2017 of the works of decades past, Hockney moved right along to show his newest paintings on hexagonal canvases and mural-size 3D photographic drawings at Pace Gallery in 2018. He revisited paintings of Garrowby Hill, the Grand Canyon, and Nichols Canyon Road, this time painting them on hexagonal canvases to enhance aspects of reverse perspective. In 2019, his early work featured in his native Yorkshire at The Hepworth Wakefield.\nPersonal life.\nHockney is gay and has explored the nature of gay love in his portraiture. Sometimes, as in \"We Two Boys Together Clinging\" (1961), named after a poem by Walt Whitman, the works refer to his love for men. In 1963, he painted two men together in the painting \"Domestic Scene, Los Angeles\", one showering while the other washes his back. In summer 1966, while teaching at UCLA he met Peter Schlesinger, an art student who posed for paintings and drawings, and with whom he became romantically involved.\nOn the morning of 18 March 2013, Hockney's 23-year-old assistant, Dominic Elliott, died as a result of drinking drain cleaner at Hockney's Bridlington studio; he had also earlier drunk alcohol and taken cocaine, ecstasy and temazepam. Elliott was a first- and second-team player for Bridlington Rugby Club. It was reported that Hockney's partner drove Elliott to Scarborough General Hospital where he later died. The inquest returned a verdict of death by misadventure and Hockney was never implicated. In November 2015 Hockney sold his house in Bridlington, a five-bedroomed former guest house, for \u00a3625,000, cutting all his remaining ties with the town.\nHe holds a California Medical Marijuana Verification Card, which enables him to buy cannabis for medical purposes. He has used hearing aids since 1979, but realised he was going deaf long before that. He keeps fit by spending half an hour in the swimming pool each morning, and can stand for six hours at the easel.\nHockney has synaesthetic associations between sound, colour and shape.\nCollections.\nMany of Hockney's works are housed in the 1853 Gallery at Salts Mill in Saltaire, near his hometown of Bradford. Another large group of works are held by The David Hockney Foundation. His work is in numerous public and private collections worldwide, including:\nRecognition.\nIn 1967, Hockney's painting, \"Peter Getting Out of Nick's Pool\", won the John Moores Painting Prize at the Walker Art Gallery in Liverpool. Hockney was offered a knighthood in 1990 but declined, before accepting an Order of Merit in January 2012. He was awarded The Royal Photographic Society's Progress medal in 1988 and the Special 150th Anniversary Medal and Honorary Fellowship in recognition of a sustained, significant contribution to the art of photography in 2003. He was made a Companion of Honour in 1997 and awarded The Cultural Award from the German Society for Photography (DGPh). He is a Royal Academician. In 2012, he was appointed to the Order of Merit, an honour restricted to 24 members at any one time for their contributions to the arts and sciences.\nHe was a Distinguished Honoree of the National Arts Association, Los Angeles, in 1991 and received the First Annual Award of Achievement from the Archives of American Art, Los Angeles, in 1993. He was appointed to the Board of Trustees of the American Associates of the Royal Academy Trust, New York in 1992 and was given a Foreign Honorary Membership to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1997. In 2003, Hockney was awarded the Lorenzo de' Medici Lifetime Career Award of the Florence Biennale, Italy.\nCommissioned by The Other Art Fair, a November 2011 poll of 1,000 British painters and sculptors declared him Britain's most influential artist of all time. In 2012, Hockney was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork \u2013 the Beatles' \"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\" album cover \u2013 to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life that he most admires.\nHe is an Honorary Member of the Printmakers Council.\nArt market.\nOn 21 June 2006, Hockney's painting \"The Splash\" sold for \u00a32.6\u00a0million. It was offered for auction again on 11 February 2020, with an estimate of \u00a320\u201330\u00a0million and sold, to an unknown buyer, for \u00a323.1\u00a0million.\nHis \"A Bigger Grand Canyon\", a series of 60 canvases that combined to produce one enormous picture, was bought by the National Gallery of Australia for $4.6\u00a0million.\n\"Beverly Hills Housewife\" (1966\u201367), a 12-foot-long acrylic that depicts the collector Betty Freeman standing by her pool in a long hot-pink dress, sold for $7.9\u00a0million at Christie's in New York in 2008, the top lot of the sale and a record price for a Hockney. This was topped in 2016 when his \"Woldgate Woods\" landscape made \u00a39.4\u00a0million at auction.\nThe record was broken again in 2018 with the sale of \"Piscine de Medianoche\" (\"Paper Pool 30)\" for $11.74 million and then doubled in the same Sotheby's auction when \"Pacific Coast Highway and Santa Monica\" sold for $28.5 million.\nOn 15 November 2018, David Hockney's 1972 painting \"Portrait of an Artist (Pool with Two Figures)\" sold at Christie's for $90.3 million with fees, surpassing the previous auction record for a living artist of $58.4 million, held by Jeff Koons for one of his \"Balloon Dog\" sculptures. He had originally sold this painting for $20,000 in 1972.\nThe Hockney\u2013Falco thesis.\nIn the 2001 television programme and book \"Secret Knowledge\", Hockney posited that the Old Masters used \"camera obscura\" as well as \"camera lucida\" and lens techniques that projected the image of the subject onto the surface of the painting. Hockney argues that this technique migrated gradually from Northern Europe to Italy, and is the reason for the photographic style of painting we see in the Renaissance and later periods of art. He published his conclusions in the 2001 book \"Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters\", which was revised in 2006.\nPublic life.\nLike his father, Hockney was a conscientious objector, and worked as a medical orderly in hospitals during his National Service, 1957\u20131959.\nHockney was a founder of the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles, in 1979. He serves on the advisory board of the political magazine \"Standpoint\", and contributed original sketches for its launch edition, in June 2008, as well as agreeing to allow \"Standpoint\" to publish his previous views and pictures over the years.\nHe is a staunch pro-tobacco campaigner and was invited to guest-edit BBC Radio's \"Today\" programme on 29 December 2009 in which he aired his views on the subject.\nIn October 2010, he and a hundred other artists signed an open letter to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt, protesting against cutbacks in the arts.\nIn popular culture.\nIn 1966, while working on a series of etchings based on love poems by the Greek poet Constantine P. Cavafy, Hockney starred in a documentary by filmmaker James Scott, entitled \"Love's Presentation\". He was the subject of Jack Hazan's 1974 biopic, \"A Bigger Splash\", named after Hockney's 1967 pool painting of the same name. Hockney was also the inspiration of artist Billy Pappas in the documentary film \"Waiting for Hockney\" (2008), which debuted at the Tribeca Film Festival in 2008.\nHockney was inducted into \"Vanity Fair\"s International Best-Dressed Hall of Fame in 1986. In 2005 Burberry creative director Christopher Bailey centred his entire spring/summer menswear collection around the artist and in 2012 fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, a close friend, named a checked jacket after Hockney. In 2011 British \"GQ\" named him one of the 50 Most Stylish Men in Britain and in March 2013 he was listed as one of the Fifty Best-dressed Over-50s by \"The Guardian\".\nHockney was commissioned to design the cover and pages for the December 1985 issue of the French edition of \"Vogue\". Consistent with his interest in cubism and admiration for Pablo Picasso, Hockney chose to paint Celia Birtwell (who appears in several of his works) from different views for the cover, as if the eye had scanned her face diagonally.\n\"David Hockney: A Rake's Progress\" (2012) is a biography of Hockney covering the years 1937\u20131975, by writer/photographer Christopher Simon Sykes.\nIn 2012, Hockney featured in BBC Radio 4's list of \"The New Elizabethans\" to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II.

{"title": "Domenico_di_Bartolo", "label": "Artist", "text": "Domenico di Bartolo (birth name Domenico Ghezzi), born in Asciano, Siena, was a Sienese painter who became active during the early Renaissance period. As documented on text by famous painter, writer and historian Giorgio Vasari, Domenico di Bartolo was the nephew of well reputed Italian artist Taddeo di Bartolo, who is featured in Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects. By the early 1400, Domenico di Bartolo was one of the most influenced Sienese artist by the new Florentine style of painting. During the time that he was active and working, Domenico was the only Sienese painter to have received commissions by clients in Florence. Domenico was also employed by Lorenzo Vecchietta, otherwise referred to as Lorenzo di Pietro, to work alongside him for the fresco \"The Care of the Sick\", which is today considered a masterpiece of the Pilgrim's Hall in the hospital Santa Maria della Scala (Siena).\nDomenico first surfaced into the world of early Renaissance art in 1420. He, along with several other unknown Sienese artists, was documented to be part of a restoration project to paint the Siena Cathedral. He is first recorded as a master in 1428, in a list of the painters' guild (\"ruolo dei pittori\"). His first surviving signed and dated work comes from 1433: 'The Madonna of Humility and Four Music-Making Angels'. In 1433 he also painted the \"Virgin and Child Surrounded by Saints\". A year later, in 1434, Domenico provided a design for a pavement plaque in the Cathedral of Siena based on a drawing of the Emperor Sigismund, who sojourned at Siena from 1432 to 1433. From 1435 to 1440 Domenico was engaged in a fresco commission for the Cathedral's sacristy. This work, however, was interrupted in 1438 which gave Domenico time to go to Perugia to paint an altarpiece for the monastery church of Santa Giuliana, which is now displayed in the Galleria Nazionale dell'Umbria. In 1437 he also took on a contract to execute an altarpiece for the monks of Saint'Agostino at Asciano. By 1439, Domenico had been paid to work in the hospital of Santa Maria della Scala (Siena).\nThe frescoes executed in the Pellegrinaio of the hospital between 1439 and 1440 represent scenes of the institution's history and good works; they are the artist's last finished works and are considered to be his masterpieces. For the most part, Domenico's works were based in Perugia, and his only known activity outside of Siena may have been at Florence as his first biographer, Giorgio Vasari, records works carried out by him in the Carmine and Santa Trinita. In January 1440 Domenico di Bartolo was married to Antonia Pannilini, and on 18 February 1446, Antonia Pannilini was officially mentioned as a widow.\nEarly life.\nDomenico di Bartolo was born in Asciano, which was a province in Siena in the Italian region Tuscany. Domenico carried the family name Ghezzi. He was a nephew of Taddeo di Bartolo, who a reputable painter featured in Giorgio Vasari's Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects There is only one document that could have been associated with Domenico before 1428. As observed by Johns Hopkins art history professor Carl Strehlke, in the Opera del Duomo payments for 1420, a certain Domenico di Bartolo -otherwise unidentified- is compensated two soldi ( a medieval Italian silver coin) for his work as a \"gharzone di bottega\". The term \"gharzone\" may define someone's position ranging from a full-fledged apprentice to a mere helper or worker. If the document indeed were to refer to Domenico, he was most likely at the beginning stages of his artistic training, and only eight years later in 1428 he finally made a standing for himself by being acknowledged in the painter's guild. On the basis of this payment document in 1420, it is most probable that Domenico was born sometime between 1400 and 1405. However, more accurate sources that record his exact date of birth have yet to be discovered today.\nCarl Brendon Strehlke further elaborates that the payment documents for the Opera del Duomo show that, at the time, the Opera was overseeing several important sculptural commissions: a new pulpit for the Council of Siena, the decoration of the Cathedral pavement, and most importantly the construction of a new Baptismal Font. It is recorded that some of the most progressive artists in all of Tuscany were involved in these projects, names which include Ghiberti, Donatello, Francesco di Valdambrino, Domenico di Niccolo' de Cori, and Jacopo della Quercia. It is therefore not a surprise that Domenico's first extant painting, the \"Madonna of Humility\" of 1433, possessed strong sculptural qualities. Art historians such as Strehlke and Bruce Cole claim that it is highly likely that during the time that Domenico worked as a Gharzone for the Opera's projects, he received many influences from many of the mentioned sculptors. Other contemporary artists that existed during Domenico di Bartolo's time were Stefano di Giovanni and Giovanni di Paolo, who were already active master painters by their early twenties. Both di Giovanni and Giovanni di Paolo placed emphasis on more of the linear and emotive qualities of drawing, whereas di Bartolo conceived of forms in rounded masses.\nMadonna of Humility (1433).\nDomenico di Bartolo's \"Madonna of Humility\" of 1433 is recorded to be the artist's first ever commissioned piece of artwork. Renaissance Scholar Bruce Cole refers to Domenico's Madonna of Humility with Angels as \"one of the loveliest works of the early Sienese Quattrocento\". When observed comparatively, the painting traces back to hints of Masaccio as well as sculptor Jacopo della Quercia. Jacopo was likely to have influenced Domenico's painting more directly, for the practical reason that the two artists were in closer proximity to each other, and in addition they had the experience of working together for the Opera of Duomo. It is hence also entirely possible that Jacopo della Quercia could have even provided some guidance in the creation of Domenico di Bartolo's work. This type of mentorship is comparable to that of Lorenzo Ghiberti in Florence, who, as stated in the Commentary, provided the same kind of assistance to the painters in that city during his time. Another situation that can attest to Jacopo and Domenico's professional relationship comes from the written record that after Jacopo was elected to be the overseeing operator of the Cathedral of Siena's works, Domenico di Bartolo secured himself works to paint in the sacristy. Scholars such as Bruce Cole commend Domenico's \"Madonna of Humility\", because it is unlike any Sienese painting of its time. This is for several technical and stylistic reasons, all of which give insight into Domenico di Bartolo's keen eye for adaptation and observation from fellow artists. In particular, much of the art critiques give recognition to Domenico's painting because of its strong sculptural references, many of which align with Jacopo della Quercia's style.\nThe composition of the painting is centered with a very volumetrically and triangularly depicted Madonna. Behind her are five angels, who form a semicircle that gives further movement and depth into the painted space. Referring back to several of the Madonna panels by Masaccio that have survived until today, a similarity between them and Domenico's Madonna is that the large figures created dominating geometrical forms that give the overall image a strong sense of sculptural stability and gravity. Art historians also mention that the color palette of the painting is of particular skill and thoughtfulness. The green, pink and blue of the Madonna's robes in contrast with the paleness of the angels' garments and the pale green of the cloth on the infant all come together to display a trait that was peculiar to the Sienese paintings that were produced around the 1400s. Such peculiarity comes from the fact that the mixing of these colors were more definitive to Florentine styled art. Hence, color, geometric orientation, costumes, and faces all come together to suggest that Domenico would have received his early apprentice training from someone in Siena with strong Florentine influences. Two possible candidates that Bruce Cole introduces are Paolo di Giovanni Fei or Taddeo di Bartolo. Logistically, Taddeo would especially be a likely possibility because of his apparent Florentine styles in his art. Having this kind of mentorship would have most definitely have encouraged Domenico to observe and attempt to adapt the latest Florentine artistic styles, techniques, trends and developments. More so than any other Sienese painter of his time, Domenico well understood Masaccio's well recognized realistic and straightforward style of painting. In particular, he was able to incorporate Masaccio's styles into his own paintings without distorting or misrepresenting them. Domenico di Bartolo must have visited Pisa and Florence sometime in the late 1420s, where he would have witnessed paintings executed by Masaccio, who was considered by Giorgio Vasari to be one of the best painters of his time, as well as the first great Italian painter of the Quattrocento Renaissance period. Masaccio was commended for his refined skills in imitating nature, recreating lifelike movements in his subjects, as well as his consistent success in creating a convincing three dimensionality to his paintings. Domenico's observations of Masaccio's painting would have proved to be an educational experience as he later is seen to utilize a type of artistic technique called circular-arc composition within the Madonna of Humility. The five angels are arranged in a semi circle, creating significantly more tangible space for the presentation of the Virgin, without, however, affecting the flat picture plane caused by the isocephalic distribution of the angels' heads. This kind of semi-circular composition was used by Masaccio in works such as the Adoration of the Magi for the Pisa altarpiece. This technique was considered to be an effective way of organizing a large number of figures that exist in a complicated narrative scene, into a single simple geometric configuration.\nIn regards to sculptor Jacopo della Quercia, Domenico's \"Madonna of Humility\" shows hints of adaptation by displaying similarities to Jacopo's \"Madonna in the Fonte Gaia\". Both portray a new kind of gothic flexibility in the draper, which creates soft pockets of shadows that add to a new kind of weightiness to the figure and to the overall image. Domenico's \"Madonna of Humility\"eventually ended up contributing significantly more to Florentine than to Sienese art. During the time that the painting was released to the public, appreciation and recognition from Sienese art critics were minimal. To serve as evidence that there had been some kind of a partnership to exist between Jacopo and Domenico, John Pope-Hennessy's research confirms that the major works of Domenico for the Cathedral of Siena were commissioned at the time when Jacopo was the overseeing operational director of the Opera del Duomo. When Jacopo Quercia left Siena in 1435, he had selected two counsellors to proceed his job. Domenico was one of the two witnesses to approve of Jacopo's nomination decisions.\nIn the painting, the Virgin is also depicted in a way that had been popularized in Siena by Gentile da Fabriano: an Italian painter who was best known for his international gothic painting style. Other artists who depicted the Virgin in a similar manner during this time were Giovanni di Paolo for his \"Branchini Madonna of 1427\" and Andrea di Bartolo for his \"Madonna of Humility\". Yet, there are several artistic elements within Domenico's \"Madonna of Humility\" that derive from techniques frequently observed in Florentine works. The frontal view of The Virgin, who is presented in an asymmetric composition, is said to have been inspired by Masaccio's Madonna of Humility. Foreshortened halos and Virgin's crown were rare during the time that Domenico di Bartolo's painting was executed, and can only be found in the Pisa altarpiece executed by Masaccio. There, too, is an illustration of the baby with fingers in his mouth, which strongly recalls back to Masaccio's Pisa altarpiece, which illustrates the Christ child eating grapes. Domenico's Madonna of Humility successfully models lights and darks within the flesh tones, and this too is done in the style of Masaccio. However, renowned British art historian John Pope-Hennessy states in his articles that Domenico di Bartolo cannot be a fully Masacciesque painter. Whilst painters like Filippo Lippi or Andrea di Giusto depict their figures to stand up in a stiff manner, those of Domenico di Bartolo possess a certain \"Gothic flexibility\". Hennessy observes a certain fluid quality in Bartolo's paintings. For example, the Madonna's knee is bent and the angels to the left of the Madonna have curved bodies. As a result, it is infinitely more likely that Domenico drew stronger influences for the painting's details from Jacopo della Quercia.\nDomenico di Bartolo was praised for capitalizing on Florentine elements, and was considered an incredibly talented Sienese painter because of how early on in his career he had managed to adopt the Florentine Renaissance style. Giorgio Vasari notes that sometime in his career, Domenico di Bartolo painted altarpieces for Florentine churches, which confirms such appraisals and evaluations that Domenico was competent enough to analyze and infer from the Florence aspects of Renaissance art. Yet, many Sienese and general Renaissance art critics consider Domenico to still be a Sienese painter, with acquired Florentine tastes, and not a progressive Florentine painter. His work of the Madonna of Humility is ultimately considered Sienese, and many art historians conclude that at this time Domenico himself was a young artist who was attracted and eagerly open to new ideas, but perhaps had not yet assimilated such ideas to a profound meaning.\nThe Theology that seems to have influenced the Madonna of Humility aligns with preacher and proclaimed saint Bernardino Albizzeschi, otherwise referred to as Bernardino da Siena (1380-1444, canonized 1450 ). Albizzeschi is considered to be one of the major religious and political figures to have shaped the outcomes of Domenico di Bartolo's artworks and to have influenced the overall success of Domenico as an artist. During his time, Bernardino Albizzeschi was considered to be one of the most followed, loved and vilified men in Italy. He himself was not unfamiliar with the art world during his time, and was known to favor canonized artistic images from the Sienese Trecento, and therefore influenced the subsequent production of many Sienese artworks. In Domenico's \"Madonna of Humility\", the common salutation on the painting - \"Ave Maria\"- is replaced by the term \"Ave Stella Maris\", which means \"Hail Star of the Sea\". Although this ancient attribute originated early on in Christian etymology for the name Mary, there is no existing record of an author before Bernardino who had written so intricately about the term's meaning.\nIn regards to who actually commissioned Domenico di Bartolo's first work, the answer remains entirely ambiguous. However, researcher Carl Strehlke observes and concludes that two likely candidates to consider in this aspect are Casini and Bartoli, both of whom were Bishops of Siena from 1408 and 1427 respectively. Both Casini and Bartoli were close to Bernardino da Siena, and back then Bartoli was the rector of the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala from 1410 to 1427. Bernardino promotes Bartoli's position to a Bishop as a means to draw closer the relationship between the city's church and the hospital Santa Maria della Scala (Siena).\nThe Sigismund Plaque (1434).\nIn 1434, Domenico also conceived and designed a fresco panel with the representation of Emperor Sigismund Enthroned (Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor) for the Siena Cathedral, however the specific date of completion remains unknown. Art critic and historian Cesare Brandi has praised Domenico's fresco panel in his writings because of its Florentine qualities. Similar to Domenico's \"Madonna of Humility\", which was completed less than a year before the commission of the panel had begun to take form. The plaque of Emperor Sigismund is drawn with a simple semi-circle composition. Brandi comments of the architecture of the fresco panel, for although it is not entirely correct in perspective, it can be successfully viewed from below. Carl Strehlke comments on the image of the Emperor as a hierarchal presentation of Emperor Sigismund's court because he, like a Saint or Madonna, is depicted with significantly greater height in comparison to the other figures in the art piece. Domenico also utilizes symmetry principles for the fresco's composition- as observed, the man with the hat on the left is mirrored by another on the right. There are aspects of this fresco panel that can be seen again in Domenico's later on works, such as the fresco of the \"Papal Grant of Privileges to the Hospital\" in the Santa Maria della Scala (Siena).\nAdult career.\nFrom the works completed by Domenico in the later part of his thirties, only three paintings from these years have managed to survive. First, a Perugia altarpiece for Santa Giuliana. Second, a signed and dated Madonna and Child in the Johnson Collection, and finally, a small \"Madonna del Refugio\" in Siena. Domenico also frescoed the walls of the sacristy in the Siena Cathedral, however a very tiny fragment of them have managed to survive until today. Researcher Carl Strehlke mentions in his dissertations that such frescoes in the cathedral were in such poor state of maintenance that its subjects and story could not be identified. It is said that Domenico produced an average of one fresco per year, in which he seems to have produced little other work during this time. For these frescoes, however, Domenico seemed to turn away from his Florentine influences and interests, as he began to reflect more traditional Gothic styles. This is especially apparently for an altarpiece painted in 1438 for St. Giuliana, Perugia. From 1440 to 1444, Domenico produced one of his most significant works, another masterpiece, which were a series of frescoes for the pilgrims' hotel in the Ospedale di Santa Maria della Scala (Siena). The frescoes were said to have been commissioned by Giovanni Buzzichelli, who was the hotel's rector. The frescoes illustrate daily life as well as the history of the Sienese hospital. Domenico was assigned five scenes: three with everyday life episode and the other two with events that have occurred from the history of the hospital.\nSiena Cathedral Sacristy Frescoes.\nWhilst Domenico is best known for his frescoes for the Santa Maria della Scala Hospital in Siena, the Sacristy frescoes he had completed for the Siena Cathedral played an integral part of establishing Domenico's name as a rising fresco painter in Siena. Domenico began to work on the sacristy frescoes one month after his mentor sculptor Jacopo della Quercia was named the operational director of the Cathedral's artistic restoration project. As mentioned previously, it is clear that some form of a partnership had existed prior to Jacopo della Quercia's election, because of the efficient timing in which Domenico had been summoned to complete artworks for the cathedral. However, Domenico was only able to produce to the Cathedral one fresco a year, for Strehlke and other researchers observe that Domenico must have been occupied with other commissioned works. Almost none of these frescoes in the cathedral have been able to survive until today.\nMadonna and Child Enthroned (1437).\nIn 1437, four years after the Madonna of Humility, Domenico di Bartolo painted a Madonna and Child. Giorgio Vasari identifies the panel painting \"Madonna and Child Enthroned\" as a fragment of an altarpiece for the high altar of the Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence e. As observed by art historian Carl Strehlke, the pointed shortening of the upper edges and the low viewpoint of the Virgin's abdomen are all indications that the paintings composition had originally possessed different dimensions. The sides of the panel seem to have been planed and the lower edge cut. It remains unknown exactly where Domenico was residing during the time that he was painting this piece. Three possible locations are Siena, Florence or Perugia, for there are no documents that record commissions Domenico had received outside of these three mentioned locations.\nScholar Bruce Cole observes that the two largely depicted figures, the \"Madonna and the child\", seem to have the same \"awkward but compelling force\" that one can spot in Masaccio's paintings. Straying away from the more popular and predominant characteristics in Sienese paintings, Domenico's painting of the \"Madonna and Child\" carefully avoids any elegant expressions of beauty; instead, the two individuals are depicted to be unsophisticated and modest. There is a stark emotional contrast in facial expressions between the child and his apprehensive mother. Some possible sources of inspiration for this painting could have been the works of Ambrogio Lorenzetti, for similarities in the tender and fearful body gesture of the mother, along with the protecting and intertwining with the baby is evident. In addition, the Madonna's spread out right hand in Domenico's painting can be traced present to several of the hands featured in Ambrogio's paintings.\nSanta Maria della Scala (1439-1444).\nBetween 1439 and 1444, Domenico di Bartolo participated in the decoration of the Pilgrim's hall in the Hospital of Santa Maria della Scala, where he followed the artistic styles of artist Lorenzo Vecchietta and consequently produced six frescoes, all of which were signed by Domenico himself. As a result, this five year commission from the hospital became a huge proportion of Domenico's mid-thirties artistic career. Whilst six frescoes can be identified as executed by Domenico, little decorative works of the hospital has managed to survive until today. Much of these frescoes (including ones done by other Sienese artists) are in extremely poor condition, in which the subjects and contents of the frescoes are sometimes impossible to identify. Vecchietta introduced to the art world of Siena a kind of naturalistic style that Domenico soon followed, however Domenico's paintings in the hospital still demonstrated a slightly more Gothic style and approach. His interdisciplinary style, which quotes major Florentine artists, an on-the-rise Sienese painter, and his own Gothic elements, show a deep awareness for a kind of new artistic language of the Renaissance period.\nSanta Maria della Scala, Siena was one of Europe's first hospitals, and whilst it is now a museum on display, it is still one of the oldest hospital buildings surviving today. The hospital is conveniently located across both the Siena Cathedral and the Opera del Duomo, where Domenico also completed commissioned works around the same time. The hospital was also, at one point in time, one of the wealthiest and most powerful institutions in Siena. The hospital's significance extended beyond serving as the central ward for the city and its surrounding territories. It also functioned as a charitable institution. The hospital was facilitated by a wide and diverse range of committees that were considered prominent citizens. In particular, the committee included main artists who employed their own group of painters and sculptors to help decorate the wards and the church within the building. Some of the earlier contributors to the hospital from the Trecento period include Ambrogio Lorenzetti and Pietro Lorenzetti. The hospital became the ultimate destination to host meaningful Sienese art. During the time that Domenico di Bartolo was employed to paint sections of the hospital, the primary artist in charge of decorating the interior frescoes was Bartolomeo Bulgarini. Each fresco that was to be produced would display some kind of attribution to the hospital's philanthropic work. Domenico was but a minor artist to contribute to the artistic works within the building. The six frescoes he did produce however, were acknowledged by many art historians to be unique and incorporative of Gothic styles. Consequently, one could never mistaken Domenico's frescoes to be executed by a Florentine. During this time, Domenico began to display greater interest in his own native art, and many of the paintings were carried out with strong Sienese elements.\nThe frescoes that Domenico produced were located on the walls of the Pellegrinaio di Santa Maria della Scala, which served as a ward for sick patients at the time. Pellegrinaio is alternatively referred to as the Pilgrim's Hall, and the art that decorates the hall's interiors serves to represent as a strong proof of artistic development over the progressive years since the hospital had first been built in 1268. The project to decorate the Pilgrim's hall was first proposed by Giovanni di Francesco Buzzichelli (1434-1444). Giovanni is the one who summoned both Vecchietta and Domenico di Bartolo to carry out the project. Both of them successfully renovated the hall in a way that depicts realities of lively daily existence. As mentioned by Strehlke, no documentation of a commission for this hospital wall is known to exist. He also observes that although the frescoes done by Domenico di Bartolo (as well as Vecchietta) that have managed to survive until today present a unified pictorial scene, details such as changes in the framing and challenges with the architecture of the hospital show that adaptations were made during the execution of the artworks. It is unclear what position Domenico occupied in the hospital's decoration, and there are no records that he served at the planner or director of the project.\nCare of The Sick.\nDomenico's first of his six frescoes is named the \"Care of The Sick\", which is signed by Domenico with Latin inscription and dated to 1440. The fresco shows, with impressive detail, the interior layout of the hospital ward. Doctors and nurses are depicted assisting the patients, as well as carrying out other generous deeds. The fresco also depicts in the center foreground the washing of the patient's feet, directly inferring to the well-known image of Christ washing the feet of his disciples. Throughout the whole painting, Domenico vividly brings out the color of the costume and its well crafted d\u00e9cor. Because of such imitation to a real location, Domenico is said to have followed the works of Vecchietta, where both artists pave way into a whole new area of descriptive realism to the world of Sienese art. Other painters at the time such as Gentile da Fabriano and Pisanello might have depicted landscapes to be realistic or naturalistic, but they were consistently known to create images that came out of fantasy and creativity. It was therefore new to the art world for both Domenico and Vecchietta to produce images that seem to imitate a specific location. The frescoes by Domenico are also one of the first works done in Sienese art that includes visual clues for its viewers.\nEducation and Betrothal of the Foundlings.\nThe second most recognized fresco produced by Domenico was named Education and Betrothal of the Foundlings. The entire basis of which the painting is orientated upon depends almost entirely on the architectural formation. The painting depicts foundlings being betrothed under a detailed, elaborate building with grand arches. Because of the dominating architectural layout, the figures within the fresco are all formed and placed to be in a mathematically accurate spatial construction, in which all of the orthogonals join together at the single \"vanishing\" point on the painting's horizon. What makes this fresco peculiar for its time is its measurable, mathematically expressed space, which is a quality that was rarely produced in Sienese painting during the first half of the Quattrocento. Without a doubt, Domenico's decision to depict one of his frescos with such measured accuracy must have been influenced by realists of Florentine painting such as Masaccio, Masolino da Panicale and Filippo Lippi. Still, Bruce Cole writes about this fresco as one that stays eccentric and stylistically distant to Domenico's Sienese ancestors and Florentine contemporaries. Cole writes that the fresco is a \"peculiar blend of realism and fantasy, of immediacy and distance\". Because of this, the overall effect of the picture counteracts its realistic layout. Some of the most minute details in the Education and Betrothal of the Foundlings can be found in the floor tiles, rugs, decorated robes and floor to ceiling moldings.\nThe last fresco.\nDomenico was unable to finish all six frescoes in time. Domenico began to have complications in his relationship with the hospital after he was unable to deliver a completed sixth fresco. In addition to this, the hospital had also commissioned Domenico to produce a Madonna della Misericordia, of which he was also unable to finish. Strehlke presents documents that prove that Domenico was put on probation and his payroll was reduced. Strehlke suggests that a strong reason for Domenico being unable to finish his work was due to illness, of which he shortly died upon falling sick.\nFinal years.\nDi Bartolo's last ever (dated) commission was the fresco of the Coronation of the Virgin in the Cancelleria di Biccherna, for the Palazzo Pubblico of Siena. He began to paint four angel heads but his work was interrupted by his death in 1445. Soon after, the fresco was completed by another Sienese artist Sano di Pietro."}
{"title": "Julian_Ritter", "label": "Artist", "text": "Julian Ritter (September 19, 1909 \u2013 March 4, 2000) was an American painter of Polish-German descent who painted primarily nudes, clowns and portraits.\nRitter's paintings were typically rich in color. His nudes celebrated the glamor and beauty of the female form. All of his figurative paintings expressed the humanness in his subjects. He also painted landscapes at different points during his career and complex compositions dealing with mystical and spiritual subjects during his later years.\nEarly life.\nRitter was born Julian Stawski on September 19, 1909, in Hamburg, Germany, the only child of an aspiring Polish actress.\nRitter settled in Los Angeles as a young adult. He held many menial jobs during this time - dishwasher, errand boy, order clerk. He also painted lamp shades and did freelance art.\nRitter moved to Chicago and began to take a serious interest in art. He audited the night classes of Dr. Schroeder at the Chicago Art Institute. Ritter returned to Los Angeles where he later won a scholarship to the Art Center School (now, Art Center College of Design). He was introduced to figure painting under the tutelage of Stanley Reckless who had studied at the Philadelphia Academy of Art and taught in the tradition of Frank Duveneck and the Munich School. This tradition involved the classical study of anatomy and used live models for subjects. The Munich School is characterized by a naturalistic style and dark chiaroscuro.\nWhile still a student at Art Center School, Ritter received the following positive review for a showing of his work at the Brice-Lowe Galleries:\nStill another young artist holding his first local showing is Julian Ritter, whose water colors are at the Brice-Lowe Galleries. Of German birth he depicts various types and stages of man. Character is what interests him. His people are driven, by life or will. In one picture we see a procession of mendicants woefully singing or posing for sympathy, each a carefully studied type. In another a woman pushes the man who, in turn, pushes the wheelbarrow (his load) out on to the slender plank over the abyss. He has individual types of great interest: the old philosopher talking forever to a blank wall, the peasant woman going to church against the wind of life. Ritter's color is very delicate and helpful to his purpose, which is, however, mainly expressed through sensitive drawing.\nRitter graduated Art Center School in 1932 and found work at Los Angeles's film studios painting portraits for movie sets and doing other set design for Warner Brothers, MGM, Paramount and Universal. Ritter met the tall actress Francesca Chesley (1913\u20132004) in 1933. They were married on December 16, 1934. She frequently modeled for his nude paintings. They divorced in 1943.\nRitter headed to San Francisco looking for work at the Golden Gate International Exhibition of 1939. He was hired by architect Mark Daniels to paint murals for the Mines, Minerals and Machinery Building. These 90-foot murals were a great success. With money from the fair, Ritter returned to Los Angeles where he rented a small studio and began painting.\nRitter exhibited at both the Gallery of Modern Art and the Newhouse Galleries in New York City during 1941. Both exhibitions were critically acclaimed. The Art News (March 15, 1941) wrote: \"His style shows fluency and ease\" and Arts Digest (November 15, 1941) wrote: \"Ritter is more than versatile, he is complex, exceptionally talented.\" Edward Alden Jewell of the New York Times noted that Ritter's work was shown in the small entrance room of the Gallery of Modern Art, devoted to small oils, watercolors and gouaches in addition to the main exhibit. New York Times art critic, H.D., wrote of the Newhouse Galleries exhibition:\nPaintings and drawings by Julian Ritter, who has done portraits of movie stars, studied anatomy and been under contract to act in the films, may be seen at the Newhouse Galleries. This is rather flashy work with more than a little cleverness, and includes three paintings accompanied by poems\u2014rather dire comments on life today.\nThe one-man show at the Newhouse Galleries was a particular success and led to portrait commissions. While attending a party thrown by a patron who commissioned a portrait of his daughter, Ritter got drunk and stripped off his clothes, calling the other attendees \"phony baloneys\". He returned to Los Angeles.\nRitter met Hildegarde \"Hilde\" Sabena Meyer-Radon in 1942 when he saw her walking past his studio to take violin lessons from an instructor next door. Hilde had been born in Hamburg, Germany, on October 5, 1919; she immigrated to the US with her family in 1923. Hilde's appreciation for the arts led to a very warm friendship between the two and they saw each other often.\nWorld War II.\nAt the US entrance into the war, Ritter wanted to enlist in the US Navy due to his love of the sea, his sense of adventure and his loyalty to his adopted country. However, since he was not a US citizen, the Navy would not let him enlist. However, he was drafted into the US Army in November 1942. He was assigned to the 40th Engineer Regiment which was organized in Camp Pickett, Virginia, attached to the 45th Infantry Division which was part of General George Patton's 7th Army. Ritter was initially a member of the 3rd Battalion which trained at Fort Lewis, Washington.\nWhile at Camp Pickett, Ritter was selected to paint a portrait of Lt. General Ben \"Yoo-Hoo\" Lear who was the commanding officer of the 2nd Army based in Tennessee. Ritter asked Hilde to come join him at Memphis, and he asked her to marry him. Because there was no waiting period for a marriage license in Mississippi, Hilde and Ritter traveled the next morning to Hernando, Mississippi, where they got a license and were married in a small chapel on April 9, 1943. The two had a six-week honeymoon in a Memphis hotel room while he completed the painting of General Lear. After the portrait was complete, Ritter returned to Camp Pickett but was reassigned to the 1st Battalion which was later re-designated as the 2829th Battalion.\nThe 40th Engineers received additional training at Fort Pierce, Florida, and then deployed to the Gulf of Oran, Algeria, for further training. He took part in the invasion of Sicily.\nBased on his military service, Ritter became a US citizen on October 30, 1943. He attained the rank of Technician Fourth Grade (T4) and served at both Regimental headquarters and the headquarters of the 1st/2829th Battalion.\nIn October 1945 Ritter returned to Los Angeles to paint and to raise a family.\nPost-war Southern California.\n1945 to 1966.\nWhen Ritter first returned from the war, he found himself unable to paint anything but morbid, gruesome paintings of death, darkness and despair for about a year. After this he began his most prolific period. He would regularly work long hours and he became known for his fine nude studies and clowns.\nRitter and Hilde had two children while living in Hollywood: Christine was born in 1947 and Michael in 1948.\nArt critic Arthur Miller of the \"Los Angeles Times\" wrote in a 1947 review of Ritter's one-man show at the James Vigeveno Galleries in Westwood, California:\nJulian Ritter, still-young painter and etcher who has not shown here in many years, has a large exhibit at the James Vigeveno Galleries to June 12. It shows him remarkably gifted and various.\nSome will like his many paintings of girls or nudes, done in charming colors, or his characterful portraits of older folk or children. Others may prefer his slightly sardonic, action-packed grotesques of circus clowns or of merely comical people. He also can turn deeply serious with \"Refugees\" or \"Slums.\"\nIn a 1948 \"Brush Strokes\" column in the \"Los Angeles Time\"s commented:\nJulian Ritter's paintings of clowns, on view in the gallery at 401 S Lake Ave., Pasadena, are notable for liveliness of expression and color. Ritter has chosen to paint clowns, he explains, because 'In the clown one sees all the emotions a man can express; to record him is to depict humanity itself.'\nRitter moved the family to Don Pio Drive in Woodland Hills, California, in the early 1950s. The home included a studio building on a hilltop which, like all his studios, featured a pot-belly stove. In addition to his painting, Ritter was a talented landscaper and he terraced the front and rear hills with steps, paths and pools all made from slabs of broken concrete.\nAt the urging of his brother-in-law, Stewart Potter, Ritter began selling his paintings in Las Vegas in February, 1950. The two made the trip from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in Ritter's 1949 Dodge Wayfarer, a yellow convertible with no rear seat and an extended trunk which would be packed with paintings. The two went from casino to casino without any success until they met Bill Moore, the owner of the Hotel Last Frontier. Ritter sold Moore 13 framed nudes for $1000 which would become the basis of the Silver Slipper Collection of paintings. Ritter and Potter would make additional trips to Las Vegas and sold additional paintings to the Hotel Last Frontier and its adjoining Silver Slipper Casino. They also sold paintings to other hotels, casinos and their employees.\nShortly after this, Otto Eitel, owner of the Bismarck Hotel which was at the center of Chicago's Loop entertainment district, invited Ritter to do a one-man show at the Swiss Chalet Galleries and to paint a mural for the Bismarck Inn. This show was successful and led to numerous commissions including the \"Mr Whimsey\" clowns for the U.O. Colson Company. Ritter's wife and children stayed in Chicago with him for several months while he completed his commissions.\nRitter was enjoying success with his clown and nude paintings but, at the same time, he felt trapped by this success. He was not painting the great works he imagined. For inspiration, in 1956 he moved his family to Mexico, primarily living in San Blas, Nayarit, a small town on the Pacific Coast of Mexico located between Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta. Ritter wrote in a note published in the \"Los Angeles Times\" \"the place is a paradise for landscape painters and living is cheap.\" Ritter said later, \"My time in San Blas was important to me. I developed a new conception of color and a self-assurance which made me a better painter.\"\nAfter nearly a year in San Blas, Ritter returned to California in 1957 and purchased the house at 2321 Edgewater Way in the Santa Barbara Mesa neighborhood. Ritter again turned the yard into a remarkable garden.\nHilde worked at the noted Brooks Institute of Photography while Ritter continued to paint steadily as his paintings commanded higher values. Most importantly, Ritter was, at last, free to paint the works he wanted to. Ritter's work was represented in continuing exhibitions at the Poulsen Galleries in Pasadena and at frequent showings at the James Vigeveno Gallery in Westwood. He was also represented in San Francisco by the Maxwell Galleries and the Kotzbeck Gallery, and by galleries in Palm Springs and Scottsdale. Ritter was at the height of his commercial success but he disliked that the galleries were making money that he felt should be going to him. He had always had a somewhat stormy relationship with his dealers and preferred to deal directly with collectors. About this time, Ritter successfully set out to build a group of patrons who could provide financial security and independence, however, many of these collectors were demanding the familiar nudes and clowns that Ritter had tired of.\nIn 1958, the Circus company in Los Angeles published and distributed five reproductions of mounted 8x10 inch paintings. The paintings included the clowns Dilly, Flim, Flam, Helter and Skelter.\nIn 1963, Ritter had a show at the Poulsen Galleries in Pasadena, California. It was generally well-received with Scott McClean, the gallery director, stating \"This is probably the first exhibit to show the whole range and variety of the work of a man who has been known for two specialties \u2013 nudes and clowns. I think this broader view of Julian Ritter's work is long overdue.\"\nBut not all reviews of Ritter's work were glowing. A 1964 \"Los Angeles Times\" review of the same exhibit by Constance Perkins stated:\n...[Ritter's] fame rests largely on his sensual paintings of the nude figure. Second in popularity are Ritter's clowns. From any aesthetic viewpoint, both the pink nudes and the clowns become ingratiatingly sickly, redundant and commercially dull although technically capable enough. Almost unknown are the artist's portrait pieces and a series of both large canvases and small abstract drawings in which the surreal element is dominant. The portraits are traditional and the most genuine. The drawings become very 'slick.' The large canvases, on the other hand, tend to be too personal and too involved in allegory to hold as significant statements.\nIn 1964, Hilde had been sick for a year but refused to see a doctor. When she collapsed, Ritter insisted and doctors discovered she had cancer. She had a mastectomy and\nstruggled for two years before succumbing to the disease. Hilde died January 22, 1966.\nRitter began drinking heavily. He later said, \"I became a lousy cowardly drunk after my wife died. I had no respect for myself - morally, physically or spiritually. My mind and my body and my inner-self were too tired to conceive anything. I was burnt out.\"\n1966 to 1985.\nDuring 1965\u201366, Ritter painted a portrait of 17-year-old Lauren \"Laurie\" Kokx. He felt that he needed to get away from the Edgewater Way house that held so many memories of his wife, so he sold the house and its contents for $37,000. He bought a custom-built yawl still under construction in Morro Bay, California. Ritter named the boat \"Galilee\", and with the assistance of a two-man crew, on February 2, 1968, he sailed it to various ports including Acapulco, Mexico, where he was joined by Kokx. They sailed to Puntarenas, Costa Rica, where he painted for six months. He then sailed to the Galapagos Islands, Tahiti, Moorea and Bora Bora, sketching tropical scenes for later development as paintings. In December, 1968, a show was mounted at the Bernard Gallery in Los Angeles of works painted in Puntarenas that Ritter had sent home.\nWith Kokx and another crew member, Ritter left Bora Bora for Hawaii on June 17, 1970, expecting a 30-day voyage. Serious problems arose with the boat's equipment, and it began to take on sea water. Continually bailing, Ritter and his crew drifted for 87 days, running out of food and water, fearing death. On September 14, 1970, the \"Galilee\" was rescued by the U.S. Navy combat stores ship, USS \"Niagara Falls\". Ship's doctor Philip A. Becker described the emaciated crew members as \"living skeletons only four days away from death.\"\nRitter and Kokx recuperated in Hawaii for a month, then returned to California. Although he was still recovering and underweight, Ritter gave a three-hour talk at a Los Angeles gallery about being lost at sea. In attendance were family members, patrons and his first wife.\nRitter appeared on the TV game show \"To Tell the Truth\" along with two \"impostor\" contestants and the celebrity panelists in an episode that aired December 22, 1970. All three of the panelists picked Ritter since he was the only one of the three contestants who looked like he had been lost at sea without food.\nRitter donated six of his clown paintings for an auction to raise money for a group working for the release of American prisoners of war held in North Vietnam. The auction was held mid-December 1970. Among the guests of honor was Francis Gary Powers whose U-2 spy plane was shot down over the Soviet Union. One painting, a 24x36 oil, was reportedly sold for $3600. Ritter made the contribution out of sympathy for the prisoners and their families and personal gratitude to the Navy for his rescue. Ritter said \"I know what deprivation is after that ordeal. I can relate to the terrible suffering of those POWs.\"\nRitter and Kokx settled into a house in rural Summerland outside Santa Barbara for 15 years. Ritter's near-death experience catalyzed two years of intense painting. During this period, Ritter was arguably at the peak of his artistic expression. He was already a fulfilled artist who saw himself as a maestro and people treated him accordingly. His subject matter included paintings which were more mystical as he worked out the demons from the voyage, his loss of Hilde and his own alcoholism. To meet the demands of his collectors and his need for money, Ritter continued painting nudes, portraits and occasional clown compositions.\nRitter had a show in late 1975 at the Howard E. Morseburg Galleries on Wilshire in Los Angeles which included some of this new work. The show was called \"Julian's World\" and consisted of 101 paintings and 16 drawings. This was Ritter's last major public exhibit. One painting which did stand out was a crucifixion: Ritter had posed and was photographed and then painted himself onto the cross in a self-portrait.\nRitter preferred to sell directly to collectors so he could make more money. Ritter had a sufficient number of patrons at this point in his life so that he no longer needed to rely on gallery showings. However, many of these patrons were most interested in his commercial nudes and clowns rather than the more artistic paintings.\nHawaii.\nIn the summer of 1984, Ritter and Kokx separated. In 1985, Ritter and his son Michael moved into a house in Kula, Hawaii, on the island of Maui. He suffered a debilitating stroke in December 1985. After a period of convalescence, Ritter began painting again. Although the stroke limited his painting ability, he wrote and he taught painting.\nIn 1989, Michael commissioned a 30-minute video about the life and art of his father, titled \"Julian Ritter\u2014Palette of passion\". It was written and produced by Keith Gilchrist and was filmed and directed by Christopher Gentsch.\nRitter died at home on March 4, 2000, at the age of 90.\nReligion and politics.\nRitter was raised a Roman Catholic although he was not religious in his adult life \u2014 Ritter led the life of a hedonistic artist. Some family members recount that he did frequent Catholic churches to reflect. Although his paintings were not overtly religious, many of his works did have a mystical quality. One example is \"The Clown Funeral\". In it, clowns are bearing one of their own, eyes closed but wearing a beautiful clown smile. Ritter appears in self-portrait in the painting. Some compare this painting to El Greco's \"El Entierro Del Conde De Orgaz\" (\"The Burial of the Count of Orgaz\").\nFriends and patrons.\nRitter had a number of interesting friends. George Morgan, the son of Frank Morgan (\"The Wizard of Oz\"), who was wealthy from the family business distributing Angostura Bitters, was a drinking buddy. John Coleman, who taught at Art Center, and his family were also close friends who visited the Edgewater Way house frequently.\nRitter befriended Chick Rosenthal who lived in the same Hollywood bungalows in the 1930s and maintained that friendship until Rosenthal's death. Rosenthal accompanied Ritter to New York in a van in 1941 when Ritter was offered the one-man show at the Newhouse Galleries.\nRitter began a long-term friendship with Rudolph Axford from Venice, California, in the mid-1950s. Axford shared Ritter's conservative politics and love of boats, and was a Ritter patron who accumulated many pieces of his work.\nGreg Autry was another friend and patron. Autry met Ritter in 1983 after he purchased a fake Ritter in a Laguna Beach gallery. Autry both commissioned paintings and purchased other examples of Ritter's work. Autry purchased the Silver Slipper collection of Ritter's paintings from the Summa Corporation in a closed-bid auction in the late 1980s.\nArt.\nAlthough Ritter was best known for his oil paintings of nudes, clowns and portraits, he also worked in other media including pen-and-ink with watercolor, charcoal and Cont\u00e9 crayons and painted other subjects including portraits, landscapes, and complex compositions. He also liked doing caricature, often drawing cartoons rather than sending letters to friends. Ritter's style changed over the course of his life.\nArt historian and award-winning author Phyllis Settacase Barton wrote of Ritter:\nLabeling the work of Julian Ritter is not easy because his genius is not readily defined. This is because for most of his life he has painted women as though he were exploring a garden \u2013 with eyes, lips and nipples painted like blue, red and pink blossoms. His earlier work also includes lots of clowns, many of which he painted with introspection and compassion \u2013 generally to the exclusion of their surroundings \u2013 telling us that his mind, heart and eye were in league with the human being beneath the costume, behind the make-up. As an adventurer into human nature, he painted portraits, each flavored with the spirit of the sitter, each embodying the effervescence of the cycle of life. In viewing all of these paintings \u2013 nudes, clowns, portraits \u2013 we begin to become aware that Julian Ritter has been on a journey \u2013 not just a physical journey \u2013 but a speculative one in which he has really been exploring himself. But the quintessential Julian Ritter comes to us through a series of sumptuously painted, monumental pictures which I choose to call lifescapes. His promethean story about how he has travelled from spiritual darkness into the shimmering world of rapture. Julian's magnificent vertical work which he calls 'The Black Hole' tells us the story of Julian's transgression and his penance.\nOne example of a mixed-media watercolor and chalk is \"Bachelor's Housekeeping\" painted in 1939. The painting was at the DeYoung Museum in San Francisco in 1963.\nRitter had a steady presence in the Los Angeles art scene with exhibitions and showings from 1947 through 1975 when he had his last major gallery showing at the Howard E. Morseburg Galleries in Los Angeles. His work was typically on display in any given week at some gallery in Southern California as evidenced through display ads in the \"Sunday Los Angeles Times\". He was also frequently listed in the Calendar section of the Los Angeles Times. After this, Ritter had a sufficient number of patrons to support his lifestyle without the need for gallery showings.\nPortraits.\nRitter painted a number of prominent Californians. He also painted many actors, especially while employed at Warner Brothers where he would paint an actor in his current role. For instance, he painted Paul Muni in his role as Zola in \"The Life of Emile Zola\". He also painted Ruby Keeler, Clara Bow, Claudette Colbert, Olivia de Havilland and Veronica Lake.\nNudes and showgirls.\nRitter painted several variations of the horizontal nude pose. Other nudes include paintings of Janet Boyd, a successful Las Vegas showgirl, who he also painted as a showgirl in his painting \"The Gibson Girl.\" Boyd later wrote to Ritter: \"...I only got to be with you a few years but wonderful memories I have and will cherish. Not every girl gets to be a Ritter model. I loved every moment posing for you. The early mornings working in the studio in Santa Barbara are happy memories for me. And because your works of me will keep me young and beautiful forever.\" There were many other nudes using various models.\nRitter painted a number of nudes of his first wife, the actress Francesca Chesley. Ritter also painted a couple of nudes of his second wife, Hilde. The latter remain in the family collection.\nHe also painted many showgirl paintings, the most famous of which is \"Ruby,\" a painting of an African-American girl. He made several showgirl paintings using a model named LeeAnn which were also commercially successful.\nClowns.\nAlthough he had painted clowns before, Ritter started painting a series of unusual or tender clowns in the summer of 1948. His first visit to a circus was in 1949. Ritter said of his clown paintings \"I don't need to see clowns. My clown portraits are more like human portraits in clown make-up. They are a combination of my imagination and my memory of faces, or even my own face.\"\nRitter was commissioned in the early 1950s by an art gallery on Ventura Blvd in the San Fernando Valley to paint a set of small 8\"x10\" clowns called the Helter Skelter Clowns. The clowns included Dilly, Dally, Flim, Flam, Pitter, Patter and Helter and Skelter. These were reproduced for the mass market in 1958.\nRitter also painted a series of clowns based on \"Mr. Whimsey,\" a clown with his dog. The U.O. Colson Company of Illinois commissioned Ritter to paint a set of these paintings for a calendar. He painted several more \"Mr. Whimsey\" paintings, some of which were part of the Silver Slipper collection.\nRitter also painted a number of clown compositions featuring groups of clowns (e.g.,\"Clown Band and \"Clown Funeral\") and clown with nude or showgirl montages. Some of these feature a single clown with his arm around a showgirl, others portrayed a single nude surrounded by a variety of clowns and others were groups of clowns.\nRitter tired of painting his commercially successful clowns and made the painting \"Clown Funeral\" to announce the end of his clown paintings. After that, he painted only the occasional clown composition or a clown painting commissioned by a patron.\nLandscapes.\nAlthough he was known primarily as a figurative painter, Ritter painted a number of landscapes, particularly when he was in San Blas, Mexico, and when he made his Pacific voyage. Ritter said of the San Blas paintings that they informed him with a new sense of color. The South Pacific seemed to further transform Ritter's paintings in much the same manner as it had on Paul Gauguin decades earlier. Though these never achieved the commercial success of his nudes and clowns, they were arguably amongst his best paintings.\nLifescapes.\nRitter was a man who lived in his emotions. His paintings have been described as a \"visual record of his emotional life.\" Nowhere is this more true than in the paintings art historian Phyllis Settacase Barton called \"lifescapes.\"\nIt could be argued that the first of these lifescapes were the clown compositions. The painting, \"Clown Band\" is no less a joyful presentation of life than Ritter's later work, \"God's Children.\" \"Clown Funeral\" was a deeply introspective look with Ritter, in self-portrait, carrying the body of a fallen clown - his announcement that he was no longer interested in painting the clowns that had brought him so much commercial success. The montages of clown with either nudes or showgirls shows the duality in all of us - the sensuality and eroticism of the female form with the detached folly of the accompanying clown(s).\nBut the true lifescapes were those works that Ritter painted when he had the patronage that allowed him to eschew dealing with galleries - Ritter finally started painting the great compositions which he saw in his visions. These works were described as \"mystical looks into the core of existence and the meaning of life.\" Many of these were painted during and after the voyage that almost took his life but which also opened his mind and heart to see deeper and more introspective subjects and expressions. Paintings of the voyage revealed the absolute terror in the hollowed-out eyes of the subjects. The mystical paintings revealed a faith that higher powers were at work.\nOne critic wrote \"Julian is a man who has seen life, absorbed it and now presents it.\" Sweeping and majestic paintings presented the very essence of Ritter's emotions. \"The Carousel\" was a complicated composition exploring man's spiritual nature. Ritter dealt with man's hypocrisy in \"The Sunday Preacher\". Ritter's \"Man on the Cross\" was a deeply personal view into Ritter's emotions as he painted his self-portrait onto the cross. One critic wrote of the piece: \"Undoubtedly, it is a daring and modern interpretation of life. It is a work which will cause considerable controversy. But what great artist hasn't caused that? What artist of any note has not or will not speak his own mind through his pictures?\"\nWhen Ritter and Kokx separated in the summer of 1984, Ritter's work became more dark expressing the aloneness he felt in his partner's absence.\nRitter's work changed again when he went to Maui, building again on the spiritual. Art historian Phyllis Settacase Barton wrote of these paintings: \"In the glowing panoramic scenes, powerfully and prayerfully, Julian Ritter lets us in on some of his most intimate secrets, eases us into his precious discoveries and shares with us deepest concerns.\"\nSilver Slipper Casino collection.\nThe Silver Slipper Casino collection started in February, 1950 when Ritter sold 13 framed nude paintings for $1000 to Bill Moore, the owner of the Last Frontier Hotel. By 1962, 33 paintings of nudes, showgirls, clowns and clown/nude montages adorned the walls of the upstairs theater.\nOn April 4, 1955, the Last Frontier Hotel became the New Frontier Hotel under the management Jacob Kozloff. In 1967, Howard Hughes bought both the New Frontier Hotel and the Silver Slipper Casino.\nAfter Hughes' death, Howard Hughes' Summa Corporation sold both the Silver Slipper Casino and the Frontier Hotel to the Elardi family in 1988 and divested itself of its contents including the paintings which were auctioned off in a closed-bid auction. Greg Autry won the auction and continues to hold the collection which has not been seen for many years."}
{"title": "Romaine_Brooks", "label": "Artist", "text": "Romaine Brooks (born Beatrice Romaine Goddard; May 1, 1874 \u2013 December 7, 1970) was an American painter who worked mostly in Paris and Capri. She specialized in portraiture and used a subdued tonal palette keyed to the color gray. Brooks ignored contemporary artistic trends such as Cubism and Fauvism, drawing on her own original aesthetic inspired by the works of Charles Conder, Walter Sickert, and James McNeill Whistler. Her subjects ranged from anonymous models to titled aristocrats. She is best known for her images of women in androgynous or masculine dress, including her self-portrait of 1923, which is her most widely reproduced work.\nBrooks had an unhappy childhood after her alcoholic father abandoned the family; her mother was emotionally abusive and her brother mentally ill. By her own account, her childhood cast a shadow over her whole life. She spent several years in Italy and France as a poor art student, then inherited a fortune upon her mother's death in 1902. Wealth gave her the freedom to choose her own subjects. She often painted people close to her, such as the Italian writer and politician Gabriele D'Annunzio, the Russian dancer Ida Rubinstein, and her partner of more than 50 years, the writer Natalie Barney.\nAlthough she lived until 1970, it is erroneously believed that she painted very little after 1925 despite evidence to the contrary. She made a series of drawings during the 1930s, using an \"unpremeditated\" techniques predating automatic drawing. She spent time in New York City in the mid 1930s, completing portraits of Carl Van Vechten and Muriel Draper. Many of her works are unaccounted for, but photographic reproductions attest to her ongoing artwork. It is thought to have culminated in her 1961 portrait of Duke Uberto Strozzi.\nLife and career.\nEarly life and education.\nBeatrice Romaine Goddard was born in Rome, the youngest of three children of the wealthy American Ella (Waterman) Goddard and her husband Major Henry Goddard who was also American. Her maternal grandfather was the coal mining multi-millionaire Isaac S. Waterman Jr. Her parents divorced when she was small, and her father abandoned the family. Beatrice was raised in New York by her unstable mother, who abused her emotionally while doting on her mentally ill brother, St. Mar. According to one source, Goddard had to tend to St. Mar, because he attacked anyone else who came near him. According to her memoir, when she was seven, her mother fostered her to a poor family living in a New York City tenement, then disappeared and stopped making the agreed-upon payments. The family continued to care for Beatrice, although they sank further into poverty. She did not tell them where her grandfather lived for fear of being returned to her mother. Other sources record that she attended a girls' school in New Jersey, an Italian convent and a Swiss finishing school.\nAfter the foster family located her grandfather, he arranged to send Beatrice to study for several years at St. Mary's Hall (now Doane Academy) an Episcopal girls boarding school in Burlington, New Jersey. Later, she attended a convent school, in between times spent with her mother, who moved around Europe constantly, although the stress of travel made St. Mar harder to control. In adulthood, Goddard Brooks referred to herself as having been a \"child-martyr\".\nIn 1893 at the age of 19, Goddard left her family and went to Paris. She extracted a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1897. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what now would be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she picked it up and hit him in the face with it, but he and his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.\nIn the summer of 1899, Goddard rented a studio in the poorest part of the island of Capri. Despite her best efforts, her funds were still insufficient. After several months of near starvation, she suffered a physical breakdown. In 1901, she returned to New York when her brother St. Mar died; with her grief-stricken mother dying less than a year later from diabetes complications. Goddard was 28 when she and her sister inherited the large estate their Waterman grandfather had left, which made them independently wealthy.\nPersonal life.\nDespite being a lesbian, on June 13, 1903, Goddard married her friend John Ellingham Brooks and acquired British nationality. Brooks was an unsuccessful pianist and translator who was in deep financial difficulty. He was homosexual as well, and Goddard never revealed exactly why she married him. Her first biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that she was motivated by concern for him and a desire for companionship, rather than the need for a marriage of convenience. They quarreled almost immediately when she cut her hair and ordered men's clothes for a planned walking tour of England; he refused to be seen in public with her dressed that way. Chafing at his desire for outward propriety, she left him after only a year and moved to London. His repeated references to \"our\" money frightened her, as the money was her inheritance and none of it his. After they split, she continued to give Brooks an allowance of 300 pounds per year. He lived comfortably on Capri, with E.F. Benson, until he died of liver cancer in 1929.\nCareer.\nIn 1904, Romaine Brooks, the name she preferred, became dissatisfied with her work, and in particular with the bright color schemes that she had used in her early paintings. She travelled to St. Ives on the Cornish coast, rented a small studio, and began learning to create finer gradations of gray. When a group of local artists asked her to give an informal show of her work, she displayed only some pieces of cardboard on which she had dabbed her experiments with gray paint. From then on, nearly all of her paintings are keyed to a gray, white and black color scheme with touches and tints of ochre, umber, alizarin and teal. By 1905, she had found her tonal palette, and would continue to develop these harmonics her whole career.\nFirst exhibition.\nBrooks left St. Ives and moved to Paris. Poor young painters such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse were creating new art in the Bohemian districts of Montparnasse and Montmartre. In contrast, Brooks took an apartment in the fashionable 16th arrondissement, mingled in elite social circles, and painted portraits of wealthy and titled women. These included her current lover, the Princess de Polignac.\nIn 1910, Brooks had her first solo show at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, displaying thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls. Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against tonal backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions. The paintings were generally naturalistic, showing an attentive eye for the details of \"Belle \u00c9poque\" fashion, with parasols, veils, and elaborate bonnets on display.\nBrooks included two nude studies in this first exhibition\u2014a provocative choice for a woman artist in 1910. In \"The Red Jacket\", a young woman stands in front of a large folding screen, wearing only a small open jacket, with her hands behind her back. Her emaciated stature and forlorn expression led one contemporary reviewer to refer to her as a consumptive; Brooks described her simply as \"a poor girl who was cold\". The other, \"White Azaleas\", is a more sexually charged nude study of a woman reclining on a couch. Contemporary reviews compared it to Francisco de Goya's \"La maja desnuda\" and \u00c9douard Manet's \"Olympia\". Unlike the women in those paintings, the subject of \"White Azaleas\" looks away from the viewer; in the background above her is a series of Japanese prints which Brooks loved.\nThe exhibition established Brooks' reputation as an artist. Reviews were effusive, and the poet Robert de Montesquiou wrote an appreciation calling her \"the thief of souls.\" The restrained, almost monochromatic decor of her home also attracted attention; she was often asked to give advice on interior design, and sometimes did, though she did not relish the role of decorator. Brooks became increasingly disillusioned with Parisian high society, finding the conversation dull, and feeling that people were whispering about her. Despite her artistic success, she described herself as a \"lapid\u00e9e\"\u2014literally, a victim of stoning.\nGabriele D'Annunzio and Ida Rubinstein.\nIn 1909, Brooks met Gabriele D'Annunzio, an Italian writer and politician who had come to France to escape his debts. She saw him as a martyred artist, another \"lapid\u00e9\"; he wrote poems based on her works and called her \"the most profound and wise orchestrator of grays in modern painting\".\nIn 1911, Brooks became romantically involved with the Ukrainian-Jewish actress and dancer Ida Rubinstein. Rubenstein was a tremendous celebrity of her day and caused quite a stir by appearing with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. D'Annunzio had an obsessive but unrequited attraction to Rubinstein as well. Rubinstein was deeply in love with Brooks; she wanted to buy a farm in the country where they could live together\u2014a mode of life in which Brooks had no interest.\nAlthough they broke up in 1914, Brooks painted Rubinstein more often than any other subject; for Brooks, Rubinstein's \"fragile and androgynous beauty\" represented an aesthetic ideal. The earliest of these paintings are a series of allegorical nudes. In \"The Crossing\" (also exhibited as \"The Dead Woman\"), Rubinstein appears to be in a coma, stretched out on a white bed or bier against a black void variously interpreted as death or floating in spent sexual satisfaction on Brooks' symbolic wing; in \"Spring\", she is depicted as a pagan Madonna strewing flowers on the ground in a grassy meadow. When Rubinstein starred in D'Annunzio's play \"The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian\", Brooks painted her as a blonde Saint Sebastian\u2014tied to a post, being shot with an arrow by a masked dwarf standing on a table. The dwarf is a satiric representation of D'Annunzio.\nAt the beginning of World War I, Brooks painted \"The Cross of France\", a symbolic image of France at war, showing a Red Cross nurse looking off to the side with a resolute expression while Ypres burns in the distance behind her. Although it is not a portrait of Rubinstein, it does resemble her, and she may have modelled for it. It was exhibited along with a poem by D'Annunzio calling for courage and resolution in wartime, and later reproduced in a booklet sold to raise funds for the Red Cross. After the war, Brooks received the cross of the Legion of Honor for her fundraising efforts.\nThe political imagery of \"The Cross of France\" has been compared to Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix's painting \"Liberty Leading the People\", in which a woman personifying Liberty holds up a flag against the background of a burning city. Delacroix's \"Liberty\" leads a group of Parisians who have taken up arms, while the subject of \"The Cross of France\" stands alone. Brooks used this romantic image of a figure in heroic isolation in both the 1912 portrait of D'Annunzio and her 1914 self-portrait; the subjects are wrapped in dark cloaks and isolated against seascapes.\nDuring the war, D'Annunzio became a national hero as leader of a fighter squadron. During the Paris Peace Conference, he led a group of nationalist irregulars who seized and held the city of Fiume to prevent Italy from ceding it to Croatia. He briefly set up a government, the Italian Regency of Carnaro, with himself as Duce. He was never part of Benito Mussolini's government. Although he is regarded as a precursor of Fascism, D'Annunzio disavowed any connection with Mussolini or Fascism toward the end of his life.\nThe details of Brooks's own conservative politics have been clouded by her friendship with D'Annunzio, and admiration of him as an artist and fellow sufferer. There is no evidence that she was a card-carrying Fascist or that she was sympathetic to Italian Fascism. The classicizing individualism of her paintings may have been influenced by D'Annunzio's aesthetics\u2014an idea that has troubled some viewers otherwise attracted to the imagery of Brooks's portraits.\nOn June 16, 2016, under the direction of Dr. Langer and Legion Group Arts, young Italian researcher Giovanni Rapazzini de Buzzaccarini discovered a long-lost early work by Brooks at the Vittoriale in Gardone. Brooks had copied (Pietro di Cristoforo Vannucci 1450\u20131523) Perugino's \"Portrait of a Young Man\" at the Uffizi when she was a penniless art student in Rome. She painted the man because she thought he resembled herself as a girl. She later gave the painting to D'Annunzio as a joke when she refused to become his lover. D'Annunzio was in the tasteless habit\u2014Romaine thought\u2014of hanging pictures of his mistresses in a rogue's gallery. Buzzaccarini found this painting in the music room.\nD'Annunzio and Brooks had spent the summer of 1910 in a villa on the coast of France until D'Annunzio was disrupted by one of his jealous ex-mistresses. She came to the gates of Brooks' villa with pistol in hand, demanding entry. After a brief falling out, Romaine resumed a friendship with D'Annunzio that lasted until his death in Gardone Riviera, Italy.\nBrooks painted Rubinstein one last time in \"The Weeping Venus\" (1916\u20131917), a nude based on a photographs that Brooks took during their relationship; she needed them because Rubinstein was such a restless and unreliable model. According to Brooks' unpublished memoir, the painting represents \"the passing away of familiar gods\" as a result of World War I. She said she tried to repaint Venus's features many times, but Rubinstein's face somehow kept returning: \"It fixes itself in the mind.\"\nNatalie Barney and Left Bank portraits.\nThe longest and most important relationship of Brooks' life was her three-way partnership with Natalie Clifford Barney, an American-born writer, and Lily de Gramont, a French aristocrat. She formed a trio with them that lasted the rest of their lives.\nBarney was notoriously non-monogamous, a fact that the other two women had to accept. Brooks met Barney in 1916, at a time when the writer had already been involved for about seven years with Duchess Elisabeth de Gramont, also known as Lily or Elisabeth de Clermont-Tonnerre. She was married and the mother of two daughters. After a brief dust-up that resulted in Barney's offering Gramont a marriage contract while at the same time refusing to give up Brooks, the three women formed a stable lifelong triangle in which none was a third wheel. Gramont, one of the most glamorous taste-makers and aristocrats of the period, summed up their values when she said, \"Civilized beings are those who know how to take more from life than others.\" Gender fluidity and sexual freedom were paramount among women of Brooks' circle. Barney hosted a literary salon on Paris's Left Bank.\nBrooks tolerated Barney's casual affairs well enough to tease her about them, and had a few of her own over the years. She could become jealous when a new love became serious. Usually she simply left town, but at one point she gave Barney an ultimatum to choose between her and Dolly Wilde\u2014relenting once Barney had given in. At the same time, while Brooks was devoted to Barney, she did not want to live with her full-time. She disliked Paris, disdained Barney's friends, and hated the constant socializing on which Barney thrived. She felt most fully herself when alone. To accommodate Brooks's need for solitude, the women built a summer home consisting of two separate wings joined by a dining-room, which they called \"Villa Trait d'Union,\" the \"hyphenated villa\". Brooks spent part of each year in Italy or traveling elsewhere in Europe, away from Barney. The relationship lasted for more than 50 years.\nBrooks's portrait of Barney has a softer look than her other paintings of the 1920s. Barney sits, swathed in a fur coat, in the house at 20 Rue Jacob where she lived and held her salon. In the window behind her, the courtyard is seen dusted with snow. Brooks often included animals or models of animals in her compositions to represent the personalities of her sitters; she painted Barney with a small sculpture of a horse, alluding to the love of riding that had led Remy de Gourmont to nickname her \"the Amazon\". The paper on which the horse stands may be one of Barney's manuscripts.\nFrom 1920 to 1924, most of Brooks's subjects were women who were in Barney's social circle or who visited her salon. Truman Capote, who toured Brooks's studio in the late 1940s, may have been exaggerating when he called it \"the all-time ultimate gallery of all the famous dykes from 1880 to 1935 or thereabouts\", but Brooks painted many of them. Barney's lover of the moment was Eyre de Lanux; her own lover Renata Borgatti; Una, Lady Troubridge, the partner of Radclyffe Hall; and the artist Gluck (Hannah Gluckstein). Another of Brooks' lovers was the wildly eccentric Marchesa Luisa Casati, whose portrait she painted in 1920 while on Capri.\nSeveral of these paintings depict women who had adopted some elements of male dress. While in 1903, Brooks had shocked her husband by cutting her hair short and ordering a suit of men's clothes from a tailor, by the mid-1920s bobbed and cropped hairstyles were \"in\" for women and wearing tailored jackets\u2014usually with a skirt\u2014was a recognized fashion, discussed in magazines as the \"severely masculine\" look. Women such as Gluck, Troubridge, and Brooks used variations of the masculine mode, not to pass as men, but as a signal\u2014a way of making their sexuality visible to others. At the time these paintings were made, however, it was a code that only a select few knew how to read. To a mainstream audience, the women in these paintings probably just looked fashionable.\nGluck, an English artist whom Brooks painted around 1923, was noted in the contemporary press as much for her style of dress as for her art. She pushed the masculine style further than most by wearing trousers on all occasions, which was not considered acceptable in the 1920s. Articles about her presented her cross-dressing as an artistic eccentricity or as a sign that she was ultra-modern. Brooks' portrait shows Gluck in a starched white shirt, a silk tie, and a long black belted coat that she designed and had made by a \"mad dressmaker\"; her right hand, at her waist, holds a man's hat. Brooks painted these masculine accoutrements with the same attention she had once given to the parasols and ostrich plumes of La Belle \u00c9poque. However, while many of Brooks' early paintings show sad and withdrawn figures \"consumed by petticoats, veiled hats and other period trappings of femininity\", Gluck is self-possessed and quietly intense\u2014an artist who insists on being taken seriously. Her appearance is so androgynous that it would be difficult to identify her as a woman without help from the title, and the title itself\u2014\"Peter, a Young English Girl\"\u2014underscores the gender ambiguity of the image.\nBrooks's 1923 self-portrait has a somber tone. Brooks\u2014who also designed her own clothes\u2014painted herself in a tailored riding coat, gloves, and top hat. Behind her is a ruined building rendered in gray and black, underneath a slate-colored sky. The only spots of strong color are her lipstick and the red ribbon of the Legion of Honor that she wears on her lapel, recalling the Red Cross insignia in \"The Cross of France\". Her eyes are shaded by the brim of her hat, so that, according to one critic, \"she's watching you before you get close enough to look at her. She's not passively inviting your approach; she's deciding whether you're worth bothering with.\"\nLiterary portraits of Brooks.\nIn 1925, Brooks had solo exhibitions in Paris, London, and New York. There is no evidence to substantiate the claim that Brooks ceased painting after 1925. While in New York during the '30s, she produced portraits of Carl Van Vechten in 1936 Muriel Draper in 1938 that we know of. We know that she purchased paints in WWII when she and Natalie were trapped in Florence. As researchers, we know from photographs that there are lost works by Brooks still to be rediscovered. After that year, she produced only four more paintings, including portraits of Carl Van Vechten in 1936 and Muriel Draper in 1938. Moreover, Brooks did complete what previous scholars thought to be her last portrait at the age of 87 in 1961. The artist stated that she had drawn all her life so there is no reason to assume she was not doing so by the time MacAvoy painted her portrait. In fact, she herself says in her audio interview from 1968 that she was miffed by the fact that McAvoy portrait of her showed a bunch of dried up brushes rather than the glass table she used as a palette \"As if I didn't paint.\" Her comments seem to indicate she was anything but dried up as a painter. In fact, she had intended to paint a portrait of MacAvoy but he never had time to sit for her. During the '30s, she became the subject of literary portraits by three writers. Each portrayed her as part of lesbian social circles in Paris and Capri.\nBrooks was the model for the painter Venetia Ford in Radclyffe Hall's first novel \"The Forge\" (1924). The protagonist Susan Brent first encounters Ford among a group of women at a masquerade ball in Paris; the descriptions of these women correspond closely to Brooks's portraits, particularly those of Elisabeth de Gramont and Una Troubridge. Brent decides to leave her husband and pursue art after seeing the painting \"The Weeping Venus\". Brooks also appeared in Compton Mackenzie's \"Extraordinary Women\" (1928), a novel about a group of lesbians on Capri during World War I, as the composer Olympia Leigh. Although the novel is satirical, Mackenzie treats Brooks with more dignity than the rest of the characters, portraying her as a detached observer of the others' jealous intrigues\u2014even those of which she is the focus. In Djuna Barnes's \"Ladies Almanack\" (1928), a \"roman \u00e0 clef\" of Natalie Barney's circle in Paris, she makes a brief appearance as Cynic Sal, who \"dresse[s] like a coachman of the period of Pecksniff\"\u2014a reference to the style of dress seen in her 1923 self-portrait.\nDrawings and later life.\nIn 1930, while laid up with a sprained leg, Brooks began a series of more than 100 drawings of humans, angels, demons, animals, and monsters, all formed out of continuous curved lines. She said that when she started a line she did not know where it would go, and that the drawings \"evolve\u00a0[d] from the subconscious...[w]ithout premeditation.\" Brooks was writing her unpublished memoir \"No Pleasant Memories\" at the same time she began this series of drawings. Critics have interpreted them as exploring the continuing effect of her childhood on her\u2014a theme expressed even in the symbol she used to sign them, a wing on a spring. Decades later, at 85, she said, \"My dead mother gets between me and life.\"\nBrooks is thought to have stopped painting by several writers, but she herself tells us that she drew all her life. She moved from Paris to Villa Sant'Agnese, a villa outside Florence, Italy in 1937, and in 1940\u2014fleeing the invasion of France by Germany\u2014Barney joined her there. After World War II ended, Brooks declined to move back to Paris with Barney, saying she wanted to \"get back to [her] painting and painter's life\", but in fact she virtually abandoned art after the war. She and Barney were involved in promoting her work and arranging gallery and museum placements for her paintings. She became increasingly reclusive, and while Barney continued to visit her frequently, by the mid-1950s she had to stay in a hotel, meeting Brooks only for lunch. Brooks spent weeks at a time in a darkened room, believing she was losing her eyesight. According to Secrest, she became paranoid, fearing that someone was stealing her drawings and that her chauffeur planned to poison her. However, subsequent research (Langer) leads researchers to believe her fears were not unfounded. In a 1965 letter, she cautioned Barney not to lie down on the benches in her garden, lest the plants feed on her life force: \"Trees especially are our enemies and would suck us dry.\" In the last year of her life, she stopped communicating with Barney entirely, leaving letters unanswered and refusing to open the door when Barney came to visit. Her reasons for doing so are referenced in Langer's biography. She died in Nice, France in 1970 at the age of 96. Brooks is buried in the old English Cemetery in Nice, in a family plot with her mother and her brother St. Mar.\nInfluences.\nBrooks kept aloof from the artistic trends and movements of her time, \"act[ing] as if the Fauvists, the Cubists, and the Abstract Expressionists did not exist.\" However, some critics have mistakenly said Brooks was influenced by Aubrey Beardsley's illustrations, a claim Brooks herself refutes in her 1968 audio interview. The imagery of the 1930s drawings continues Brooks's experiments in the Surreal that she began as a teenager in the late 1880s. Her use of \"premeditated\" drawings as a route to the subconscious has been compared to automatic drawings by the Surrealists of the 1920s, but Brooks's work predates Surrealists such as Andr\u00e9 Masson by decades. MacAvoy called her the first Surrealist.\nThe most widely observed influence on Brooks's painting is that of James McNeill Whistler, whose subdued palette probably inspired her to adopt a monotone color scheme with accents of tinted pigments because through this technique she could suggest a classical restraint and create tensions that were modulated by shape, texture, and variations of shading throughout her canvases. She may have been introduced to Whistler's work by the art collector Charles Lang Freer, whom she met on Capri around 1899, and who bought one of her early works. Brooks said she \"wondered at the magic subtlety of [Whistler's] tones\" but thought his 'symphonies' lacked the corresponding subtlety of expression. One 1920 portrait may take its composition from a painting by Whistler. While the poses are almost identical, Brooks removes the little girl and all the details of Whistler's domestic scene, leaving only Borgatti and her piano\u2014an image of an artist completely focused on her art.\nLegacy and modern criticism.\nBrooks's realistic style may have led many art critics to dismiss her, and by the 1960s her work was largely forgotten. The revival of figurative painting since the 1980s, and new interest in the exploration of gender and sexuality through art, have led to a reassessment of her work. She is now seen as a precursor of present-day artists whose works depict gender variance and transgender themes. Critics have described her portraits of the 1920s as a \"sly celebration of gender-bending as a kind of heroic act\" and as creating \"the first visible Sapphic stars in the history of modernism.\"\nBrooks's portraits starting with her 1914 self-portrait extending through \"The Cross of France\" have been interpreted as creating new images of strong women. The portraits of the 1920s in particular\u2014cross-dressed and otherwise\u2014portray their subjects as powerful, self-confident, and fearless. One critic compared them to the faces on Mount Rushmore. Brooks seems to have seen her portraits in this light. According to a memoir by Natalie Barney, one woman complained, upon seeing her portrait, \"You haven't beautified me\", to which Brooks replied \"I have ennobled you.\"\nBrooks did not always ennoble her subjects. Inherited wealth freed her from the need to sell her paintings; she did not care whether she pleased her sitters or not, and her wit, when unleashed, could be devastating. A striking example is her 1914\u20131915 portrait of Elsie de Wolfe, an interior designer who she felt had copied her monochromatic color schemes. Brooks painted de Wolfe porcelain-pale, in an off-white dress and a bonnet resembling a shower cap; a white ceramic goat placed on a table at her elbow seems to mimic her simpering expression.\nOne of Brooks's more analyzed paintings, a 1924 portrait of Una, Lady Troubridge, has been seen as everything from an image of female self-empowerment to a caricature. Art critic Michael Duncan sees the painting as making fun of Troubridge's \"dandified appearance\", while for Meryle Secrest it is \"a tour de force of ironic commentary\". Laura Doan, pointing out newspaper and magazine articles from 1924 in which high collars, tailored satin jackets, and watch fobs are described as the latest in women's wear, describes Troubridge as having a \"keen fashion sense and an eye for sartorial detail\". But, these British fashions may not have been favored in Paris; Natalie Barney and others in her circle considered Troubridge's outfits ridiculous. Brooks expressed her own view in a letter to Barney: \"Una is funny to paint. Her get-up is remarkable. She will live perhaps and cause future generations to smile.\"\nIn 2016, \"Smithsonian magazine\" featured an exhibition of the art of Romaine Brooks, declaring \"The world is finally ready to understand Romaine Brooks.\""}
{"title": "Staphylococcus_aureus", "label": "Disease", "text": "Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive round-shaped bacterium, a member of the Firmicutes, and is a usual member of the microbiota of the body, frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen. Although \"S. aureus\" usually acts as a commensal of the human microbiota it can also become an opportunistic pathogen, being a common cause of skin infections including abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. \"S. aureus\" is one of the leading pathogens for deaths associated with Antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant \"S. aureus\" (MRSA) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine. Despite much research and development, no vaccine for \"S. aureus\" has been approved.\nAn estimated 20% to 30% of the human population are long-term carriers of \"S. aureus\" which can be found as part of the normal skin flora, in the nostrils, and as a normal inhabitant of the lower reproductive tract of women. \"S. aureus\" can cause a range of illnesses, from minor skin infections, such as pimples, impetigo, boils, cellulitis, folliculitis, carbuncles, scalded skin syndrome, and abscesses, to life-threatening diseases such as pneumonia, meningitis, osteomyelitis, endocarditis, toxic shock syndrome, bacteremia, and sepsis. It is still one of the five most common causes of hospital-acquired infections and is often the cause of wound infections following surgery. Each year, around 500,000 patients in hospitals of the United States contract a staphylococcal infection, chiefly by \"S. aureus\". Up to 50,000 deaths each year in the United States are linked with \"S. aureus\" infections.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nIn 1880, Alexander Ogston, a Scottish surgeon, discovered that \"Staphylococcus\" can cause wound infections after noticing groups of bacteria in pus from a surgical abscess during a procedure he was performing. He named it \"Staphylococcus\" after its clustered appearance evident under a microscope. Then, in 1884, German scientist Friedrich Julius Rosenbach identified \"Staphylococcus aureus\", discriminating and separating it from \"Staphylococcus albus\", a related bacterium. In the early 1930s, doctors began to use a more streamlined test to detect the presence of an \"S. aureus\" infection by the means of coagulase testing, which enables detection of an enzyme produced by the bacterium. Prior to the 1940s, \"S. aureus\" infections were fatal in the majority of patients. However, doctors discovered that the use of penicillin could cure \"S. aureus\" infections. Unfortunately, by the end of the 1940s, penicillin resistance became widespread amongst this bacterium population and outbreaks of the resistant strain began to occur.\nEvolution.\n\"Staphylococcus aureus\" can be sorted into ten dominant human lineages. There are numerous minor lineages as well, but these are not seen in the population as often. Genomes of bacteria within the same lineage are mostly conserved, with the exception of mobile genetic elements. Mobile genetic elements that are common in \"S. aureus\" include bacteriophages, pathogenicity islands, plasmids, transposons, and staphylococcal cassette chromosomes. These elements have enabled \"S. aureus\" to continually evolve and gain new traits. There is a great deal of genetic variation within the \"S. aureus\" species\".\" A study by Fitzgerald et al. (2001) revealed that approximately 22% of the \"S. aureus\" genome is non-coding and thus can differ from bacterium to bacterium. An example of this difference is seen in the species' virulence. Only a few strains of \"S. aureus\" are associated with infections in humans. This demonstrates that there is a large range of infectious ability within the species.\nIt has been proposed that one possible reason for the great deal of heterogeneity within the species could be due to its reliance on heterogeneous infections. This occurs when multiple different types of \"S. aureus\" cause an infection within a host. The different strains can secrete different enzymes or bring different antibiotic resistances to the group, increasing its pathogenic ability. Thus, there is a need for a large number of mutations and acquisitions of mobile genetic elements.\nAnother notable evolutionary process within the \"S. aureus\" species is its co-evolution with its human hosts. Over time, this parasitic relationship has led to the bacterium's ability to be carried in the nasopharynx of humans without causing symptoms or infection. This allows it to be passed throughout the human population, increasing its fitness as a species. However, only approximately 50% of the human population are carriers of \"S. aureus\", with 20% as continuous carriers and 30% as intermittent. This leads scientists to believe that there are many factors that determine whether \"S. aureus\" is carried asymptomatically in humans, including factors that are specific to an individual person. According to a 1995 study by Hofman et al., these factors may include age, sex, diabetes, and smoking. They also determined some genetic variations in humans that lead to an increased ability for \"S. aureus\" to colonize, notably a polymorphism in the glucocorticoid receptor gene that results in larger corticosteroid production. In conclusion, there is evidence that any strain of this bacterium can become invasive, as this is highly dependent upon human factors.\nThough \"S. aureus\" has quick reproductive and micro-evolutionary rates, there are multiple barriers that prevent evolution with the species. One such barrier is AGR, which is a global accessory gene regulator within the bacteria. This such regulator has been linked to the virulence level of the bacteria. Loss of function mutations within this gene have been found to increase the fitness of the bacterium containing it. Thus, \"S. aureus\" must make a trade-off to increase their success as a species, exchanging reduced virulence for increased drug resistance. Another barrier to evolution is the Sau1 Type I restriction modification (RM) system. This system exists to protect the bacterium from foreign DNA by digesting it. Exchange of DNA between the same lineage is not blocked, since they have the same enzymes and the RM system does not recognize the new DNA as foreign, but transfer between different lineages is blocked.\nMicrobiology.\n\"S. aureus\" (, Greek \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03cc\u03ba\u03bf\u03ba\u03ba\u03bf\u03c2, \"grape-cluster berry\", Latin \"aureus\", \"golden\") is a facultative aerobic, Gram-positive coccal (round) bacterium also known as \"golden staph\" and \"oro staphira\". \"S. aureus\" is nonmotile and does not form spores. In medical literature, the bacterium is often referred to as \"S. aureus\", \"Staph aureus\" or \"Staph a.\". \"S. aureus\" appears as staphylococci (grape-like clusters) when viewed through a microscope, and has large, round, golden-yellow colonies, often with hemolysis, when grown on blood agar plates. \"S. aureus\" reproduces asexually by binary fission. Complete separation of the daughter cells is mediated by \"S. aureus\" autolysin, and in its absence or targeted inhibition, the daughter cells remain attached to one another and appear as clusters.\n\"S. aureus\" is catalase-positive (meaning it can produce the enzyme catalase). Catalase converts hydrogen peroxide () to water and oxygen. Catalase-activity tests are sometimes used to distinguish staphylococci from enterococci and streptococci. Previously, \"S. aureus\" was differentiated from other staphylococci by the coagulase test. However, not all \"S. aureus\" strains are coagulase-positive and incorrect species identification can impact effective treatment and control measures.\n\"Staphylococcus\" is different from the similarly named and medically relevant genus \"Streptococcus\".\nNatural genetic transformation is a reproductive process involving DNA transfer from one bacterium to another through the intervening medium, and the integration of the donor sequence into the recipient genome by homologous recombination. \"S. aureus\" was found to be capable of natural genetic transformation, but only at low frequency under the experimental conditions employed. Further studies suggested that the development of competence for natural genetic transformation may be substantially higher under appropriate conditions, yet to be discovered.\nRole in health.\nIn humans, \"S. aureus\" can be present in the upper respiratory tract, gut mucosa, and skin as a member of the normal microbiota. However, because \"S. aureus\" can cause disease under certain host and environmental conditions, it is characterized as a \"pathobiont\".\nRole in disease.\nWhile \"S. aureus\" usually acts as a commensal bacterium, asymptomatically colonizing about 30% of the human population, it can sometimes cause disease. In particular, \"S. aureus\" is one of the most common causes of bacteremia and infective endocarditis. Additionally, it can cause various skin and soft-tissue infections, particularly when skin or mucosal barriers have been breached.\n\"S. aureus\" infections can spread through contact with pus from an infected wound, skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, and contact with objects used by an infected person such as towels, sheets, clothing, or athletic equipment. Joint replacements put a person at particular risk of septic arthritis, staphylococcal endocarditis (infection of the heart valves), and pneumonia.\nPreventive measures include washing hands often with soap and making sure to bathe or shower daily.\n\"S. aureus\" is a significant cause of chronic biofilm infections on medical implants, and the repressor of toxins is part of the infection pathway.\n\"S. aureus\" can lay dormant in the body for years undetected. Once symptoms begin to show, the host is contagious for another two weeks, and the overall illness lasts a few weeks. If untreated, though, the disease can be deadly. Deeply penetrating \"S. aureus\" infections can be severe.\nSkin infections.\nSkin infections are the most common form of \"S. aureus\" infection. This can manifest in various ways, including small benign boils, folliculitis, impetigo, cellulitis, and more severe, invasive soft-tissue infections.\n\"S. aureus\" is extremely prevalent in persons with atopic dermatitis, more commonly known as eczema. It is mostly found in fertile, active places, including the armpits, hair, and scalp. Large pimples that appear in those areas may exacerbate the infection if lacerated. This can lead to staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, a severe form of which can be seen in newborns.\nThe presence of \"S. aureus\" in persons with atopic dermatitis is not an indication to treat with oral antibiotics, as evidence has not shown this to give benefit to the patient. However, topical antibiotics combined with corticosteroids have been found to improve the condition. Colonization of \"S. aureus\" drives inflammation of atopic dermatitis; \"S. aureus\" is believed to exploit defects in the skin barrier of persons with atopic dermatitis, triggering cytokine expression and therefore exacerbating symptoms.\nFood poisoning.\n\"S. aureus\" is also responsible for food poisoning and achieves this by generating toxins in the human body. Its incubation period lasts one to six hours, with the illness itself lasting from 30 minutes to 3 days.\nPreventive measures one can take to help prevent the spread of the disease include washing hands thoroughly with soap and water before preparing food. Stay away from any food if ill, and wear gloves if any open wounds occur on hands or wrists while preparing food. If storing food for longer than 2 hours, keep the food below 40 or above 140 \u00b0F (4.4 or 60\u00a0\u00b0C).\nBone and joint infections.\n\"S. aureus\" is the bacterium commonly responsible for all major bone and joint infections. This manifests in one of three forms: osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, and infection from a replacement joint surgery.\nBacteremia.\n\"S. aureus\" is a leading cause of bloodstream infections throughout much of the industrialized world. Infection is generally associated with breaks in the skin or mucosal membranes due to surgery, injury, or use of intravascular devices such as catheters, hemodialysis machines, or injected drugs. Once the bacteria have entered the bloodstream, they can infect various organs, causing infective endocarditis, septic arthritis, and osteomyelitis. This disease is particularly prevalent and severe in the very young and very old.\nWithout antibiotic treatment, \"S. aureus\" bacteremia has a case fatality rate around 80%. With antibiotic treatment, case fatality rates range from 15% to 50% depending on the age and health of the patient, as well as the antibiotic resistance of the \"S. aureus\" strain.\nMedical implant infections.\n\"S. aureus\" is often found in biofilms formed on medical devices implanted in the body or on human tissue. It is commonly found with another pathogen, \"Candida albicans\", forming multispecies biofilms. The latter is suspected to help \"S. aureus\" penetrate human tissue. A higher mortality is linked with multispecies biofilms.\n\"S. aureus\" biofilm is the predominant cause of orthopedic implant-related infections, but is also found on cardiac implants, vascular grafts, various catheters, and cosmetic surgical implants. After implantation, the surface of these devices becomes coated with host proteins, which provide a rich surface for bacterial attachment and biofilm formation. Once the device becomes infected, it must by completely removed, since \"S. aureus\" biofilm cannot be destroyed by antibiotic treatments.\nCurrent therapy for \"S. aureus\" biofilm-mediated infections involves surgical removal of the infected device followed by antibiotic treatment. Conventional antibiotic treatment alone is not effective in eradicating such infections. An alternative to postsurgical antibiotic treatment is using antibiotic-loaded, dissolvable calcium sulfate beads, which are implanted with the medical device. These beads can release high doses of antibiotics at the desired site to prevent the initial infection.\nNovel treatments for \"S. aureus\" biofilm involving nano silver particles, bacteriophages, and plant-derived antibiotic agents are being studied. These agents have shown inhibitory effects against \"S. aureus\" embedded in biofilms. A class of enzymes have been found to have biofilm matrix-degrading ability, thus may be used as biofilm dispersal agents in combination with antibiotics.\nAnimal infections.\n\"S. aureus\" can survive on dogs, cats, and horses, and can cause bumblefoot in chickens. Some believe health-care workers' dogs should be considered a significant source of antibiotic-resistant \"S. aureus\", especially in times of outbreak. In a 2008 study by Boost, O\u2019Donoghue, and James, it was found that just about 90% of \"S. aureus\" colonized within pet dogs presented as resistant to at least one antibiotic. The nasal region has been implicated as the most important site of transfer between dogs and humans.\n\"S. aureus\" is one of the causal agents of mastitis in dairy cows. Its large polysaccharide capsule protects the organism from recognition by the cow's immune defenses.\nVirulence factors.\nEnzymes.\n\"S. aureus\" produces various enzymes such as coagulase (bound and free coagulases) which clots plasma and coats the bacterial cell, probably to prevent phagocytosis.\nHyaluronidase (also known as spreading factor) breaks down hyaluronic acid and helps in spreading it. Deoxyribonuclease, which breaks down the DNA, protects \"S. aureus\" from neutrophil extracellular trap-mediated killing. \"S. aureus\" also produces lipase to digest lipids, staphylokinase to dissolve fibrin and aid in spread, and beta-lactamase for drug resistance.\nToxins.\nDepending on the strain, \"S. aureus\" is capable of secreting several exotoxins, which can be categorized into three groups. Many of these toxins are associated with specific diseases.\nAntigens known as superantigens can induce toxic shock syndrome (TSS). This group comprises 25 staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) which have been identified to date and named alphabetically (SEA - SEZ), including enterotoxin type B as well as the toxic shock syndrome toxin TSST-1 which causes TSS associated with tampon use. Toxic shock syndrome is characterized by fever, erythematous rash, low blood pressure, shock, multiple organ failure, and skin peeling. Lack of antibody to TSST-1 plays a part in the pathogenesis of TSS. Other strains of \"S. aureus\" can produce an enterotoxin that is the causative agent of a type of gastroenteritis. This form of gastroenteritis is self-limiting, characterized by vomiting and diarrhea 1\u20136 hours after ingestion of the toxin, with recovery in 8 to 24 hours. Symptoms include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and major abdominal pain.\n Exfoliative toxins are exotoxins implicated in the disease staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS), which occurs most commonly in infants and young children. It also may occur as epidemics in hospital nurseries. The protease activity of the exfoliative toxins causes peeling of the skin observed with SSSS.\n Staphylococcal toxins that act on cell membranes include alpha toxin, beta toxin, delta toxin, and several bicomponent toxins. Strains of \"S. aureus\" can host phages, such as the prophage \u03a6-PVL that produces Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), to increase virulence. The bicomponent toxin PVL is associated with severe necrotizing pneumonia in children. The genes encoding the components of PVL are encoded on a bacteriophage found in community-associated MRSA strains.\nSmall RNA.\nThe list of small RNAs involved in the control of bacterial virulence in \"S. aureus\" is growing. This can be facilitated by factors such as increased biofilm formation in the presence of increased levels of such small RNAs. For example, RNAIII, SprD, SprC, RsaE, SprA1, SSR42, ArtR, SprX, and Teg49.\nStrategies for post-transcriptional regulation by 3'untranslated region.\nMany mRNAs in \"S. aureus\" carry three prime untranslated regions (3'UTR) longer than 100 nucleotides, which may potentially have a regulatory function.\nFurther investigation of i\"caR\" mRNA (mRNA coding for the repressor of the main expolysaccharidic compound of the bacteria biofilm matrix) demonstrated that the 3'UTR binding to the 5' UTR can interfere with the translation initiation complex and generate a double stranded substrate for RNase III. The interaction is between the UCCCCUG motif in the 3'UTR and the Shine-Dalagarno region at the 5'UTR. Deletion of the motif resulted in IcaR repressor accumulation and inhibition of biofilm development. The biofilm formation is the main cause of \"Staphylococcus\" implant infections.\nBiofilm.\nBiofilms are groups of microorganisms, such as bacteria, that attach to each other and grow on wet surfaces. The \"S. aureus\" biofilm is embedded in a glycocalyx slime layer and can consist of teichoic acids, host proteins, extracellular DNA (eDNA) and polysaccharide intercellular antigen (PIA). Not all \"S. aureus\" biofilms contain PIA. S. aureus biofilms are important in disease pathogenesis, as they can contribute to antibiotic resistance and immune system evasion. \"S. aureus\" biofilm has high resistance to antibiotic treatments and host immune response. One hypothesis for explaining this is that the biofilm matrix protects the embedded cells by acting as a barrier to prevent antibiotic penetration. However, the biofilm matrix is composed with many water channels, so this hypothesis is becoming increasingly less likely, but a biofilm matrix possibly contains antibiotic\u2010degrading enzymes such as \u03b2-lactamases, which can prevent antibiotic penetration. Another hypothesis is that the conditions in the biofilm matrix favor the formation of persister cells, which are highly antibiotic-resistant, dormant bacterial cells. \"S. aureus\" biofilms also have high resistance to host immune response. Though the exact mechanism of resistance is unknown, \"S. aureus\" biofilms have increased growth under the presence of cytokines produced by the host immune response. Host antibodies are less effective for \"S. aureus\" biofilm due to the heterogeneous antigen distribution, where an antigen may be present in some areas of the biofilm, but completely absent from other areas.\nStudies in biofilm development have shown to be related to changes in gene expression. There are specific genes that were found to be crucial in the different biofilm growth stages. Two of these genes include rocD and gudB, which encode for the enzyme's ornithine-oxo-acid transaminase and glutamate dehydrogenase, which are important for amino acid metabolism. Studies have shown biofilm development rely on amino acids glutamine and glutamate for proper metabolic functions.\nOther immunoevasive strategies.\nProtein A is anchored to staphylococcal peptidoglycan pentaglycine bridges (chains of five glycine residues) by the transpeptidase sortase A. Protein A, an IgG-binding protein, binds to the Fc region of an antibody. In fact, studies involving mutation of genes coding for protein A resulted in a lowered virulence of \"S. aureus\" as measured by survival in blood, which has led to speculation that protein A-contributed virulence requires binding of antibody Fc regions.\nProtein A in various recombinant forms has been used for decades to bind and purify a wide range of antibodies by immunoaffinity chromatography. Transpeptidases, such as the sortases responsible for anchoring factors like protein A to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan, are being studied in hopes of developing new antibiotics to target MRSA infections.\nSome strains of \"S. aureus\" are capable of producing staphyloxanthin \u2014 a golden-coloured carotenoid pigment. This pigment acts as a virulence factor, primarily by being a bacterial antioxidant which helps the microbe evade the reactive oxygen species which the host immune system uses to kill pathogens.\nMutant strains of \"S. aureus\" modified to lack staphyloxanthin are less likely to survive incubation with an oxidizing chemical, such as hydrogen peroxide, than pigmented strains. Mutant colonies are quickly killed when exposed to human neutrophils, while many of the pigmented colonies survive. In mice, the pigmented strains cause lingering abscesses when inoculated into wounds, whereas wounds infected with the unpigmented strains quickly heal.\nThese tests suggest the \"Staphylococcus\" strains use staphyloxanthin as a defence against the normal human immune system. Drugs designed to inhibit the production of staphyloxanthin may weaken the bacterium and renew its susceptibility to antibiotics. In fact, because of similarities in the pathways for biosynthesis of staphyloxanthin and human cholesterol, a drug developed in the context of cholesterol-lowering therapy was shown to block \"S. aureus\" pigmentation and disease progression in a mouse infection model.\nClassical diagnosis.\nDepending upon the type of infection present, an appropriate specimen is obtained accordingly and sent to the laboratory for definitive identification by using biochemical or enzyme-based tests. A Gram stain is first performed to guide the way, which should show typical Gram-positive bacteria, cocci, in clusters. Second, the isolate is cultured on mannitol salt agar, which is a selective medium with 7.5% NaCl that allows \"S. aureus\" to grow, producing yellow-colored colonies as a result of mannitol fermentation and subsequent drop in the medium's pH.\nFurthermore, for differentiation on the species level, catalase (positive for all \"Staphylococcus\" species), coagulase (fibrin clot formation, positive for \"S. aureus\"), DNAse (zone of clearance on DNase agar), lipase (a yellow color and rancid odor smell), and phosphatase (a pink color) tests are all done. For staphylococcal food poisoning, phage typing can be performed to determine whether the staphylococci recovered from the food were the source of infection.\nRapid diagnosis and typing.\nRecent activities and food that a patient has recently eaten will be inquired about by a physician, and a physical examination is conducted to review any symptoms. With more severe symptoms, blood tests and stool culture may be in order.\nDiagnostic microbiology laboratories and reference laboratories are key for identifying outbreaks and new strains of \"S. aureus\". Recent genetic advances have enabled reliable and rapid techniques for the identification and characterization of clinical isolates of \"S. aureus\" in real time. These tools support infection control strategies to limit bacterial spread and ensure the appropriate use of antibiotics. Quantitative PCR is increasingly being used to identify outbreaks of infection.\nWhen observing the evolvement of \"S. aureus\" and its ability to adapt to each modified antibiotic, two basic methods known as \"band-based\" or \"sequence-based\" are employed. Keeping these two methods in mind, other methods such as multilocus sequence typing (MLST), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), bacteriophage typing, spa locus typing, and SCCmec typing are often conducted more than others. With these methods, it can be determined where strains of MRSA originated and also where they are currently. \nWith MLST, this technique of typing uses fragments of several housekeeping genes known as \"aroE, glpF, gmk, pta, tip,\" and \"yqiL\". These sequences are then assigned a number which give to a string of several numbers that serve as the allelic profile. Although this is a common method, a limitation about this method is the maintenance of the microarray which detects newly allelic profiles, making it a costly and time-consuming experiment.\nWith PFGE, a method which is still very much used dating back to its first success in 1980s, remains capable of helping differentiate MRSA isolates. To accomplish this, the technique uses multiple gel electrophoresis, along with a voltage gradient to display clear resolutions of molecules. The \"S. aureus\" fragments then transition down the gel, producing specific band patterns that are later compared with other isolates in hopes of identifying related strains. Limitations of the method include practical difficulties with uniform band patterns and PFGE sensitivity as a whole.\nSpa locus typing is also considered a popular technique that uses a single locus zone in a polymorphic region of \"S. aureus\" to distinguish any form of mutations. Although this technique is often inexpensive and less time-consuming, the chance of losing discriminatory power making it hard to differentiate between MLST clonal complexes exemplifies a crucial limitation.\nTreatment.\nFor susceptible strains, the treatment of choice for \"S. aureus\" infection is penicillin. An antibiotic derived from some \"Penicillium\" fungal species, penicillin inhibits the formation of peptidoglycan cross-linkages that provide the rigidity and strength in a bacterial cell wall. The four-membered \u03b2-lactam ring of penicillin is bound to enzyme DD-transpeptidase, an enzyme that when functional, cross-links chains of peptidoglycan that form bacterial cell walls. The binding of \u03b2-lactam to DD-transpeptidase inhibits the enzyme's functionality and it can no longer catalyze the formation of the cross-links. As a result, cell wall formation and degradation are imbalanced, thus resulting in cell death. In most countries, however, penicillin resistance is extremely common (&gt;90%), and first-line therapy is most commonly a penicillinase-resistant \u03b2-lactam antibiotic (for example, oxacillin or flucloxacillin, both of which have the same mechanism of action as penicillin) or vancomycin, depending on local resistance patterns. Combination therapy with gentamicin may be used to treat serious infections, such as endocarditis, but its use is controversial because of the high risk of damage to the kidneys. The duration of treatment depends on the site of infection and on severity. Adjunctive rifampicin has been historically used in the management of \"S aureus\" bacteraemia, but randomised controlled trial evidence has shown this to be of no overall benefit over standard antibiotic therapy.\nAntibiotic resistance in \"S. aureus\" was uncommon when penicillin was first introduced in 1943. Indeed, the original Petri dish on which Alexander Fleming of Imperial College London observed the antibacterial activity of the \"Penicillium\" fungus was growing a culture of \"S. aureus\". By 1950, 40% of hospital \"S. aureus\" isolates were penicillin-resistant; by 1960, this had risen to 80%.\nMethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, often pronounced or ), is one of a number of greatly feared strains of \"S. aureus\" which have become resistant to most \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. For this reason, vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is commonly used to combat MRSA. Vancomycin inhibits the synthesis of peptidoglycan, but unlike \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, glycopeptide antibiotics target and bind to amino acids in the cell wall, preventing peptidoglycan cross-linkages from forming. MRSA strains are most often found associated with institutions such as hospitals, but are becoming increasingly prevalent in community-acquired infections.\nMinor skin infections can be treated with triple antibiotic ointment. One topical agent that is prescribed is Mupirocin, a protein synthesis inhibitor that is produced naturally by Pseudomonas fluorescens and has seen success for treatment of S. aureus nasal carriage.\nAntibiotic resistance.\n\"S. aureus\" was found to be the second leading pathogen for deaths associated with Antimicrobial resistance in 2019.\nStaphylococcal resistance to penicillin is mediated by penicillinase (a form of beta-lactamase) production: an enzyme that cleaves the \u03b2-lactam ring of the penicillin molecule, rendering the antibiotic ineffective. Penicillinase-resistant \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, such as methicillin, nafcillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, dicloxacillin, and flucloxacillin are able to resist degradation by staphylococcal penicillinase.\nResistance to methicillin is mediated via the \"mec\" operon, part of the staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCC\"mec\"). SCCmec is a family of mobile genetic elements, which is a major driving force of \"S. aureus\" evolution. Resistance is conferred by the \"mecA\" gene, which codes for an altered penicillin-binding protein (PBP2a or PBP2') that has a lower affinity for binding \u03b2-lactams (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). This allows for resistance to all \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, and obviates their clinical use during MRSA infections. Studies have explained that this mobile genetic element has been acquired by different lineages in separate gene transfer events, indicating that there is not a common ancestor of differing MRSA strains. Interestingly, one study suggests that MRSA sacrifices virulence, for example, toxin production and invasiveness, for survival and creation of biofilms\nAminoglycoside antibiotics, such as kanamycin, gentamicin, streptomycin, were once effective against staphylococcal infections until strains evolved mechanisms to inhibit the aminoglycosides' action, which occurs via protonated amine and/or hydroxyl interactions with the ribosomal RNA of the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit. Three main mechanisms of aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms are currently and widely accepted: aminoglycoside modifying enzymes, ribosomal mutations, and active efflux of the drug out of the bacteria.\nAminoglycoside-modifying enzymes inactivate the aminoglycoside by covalently attaching either a phosphate, nucleotide, or acetyl moiety to either the amine or the alcohol key functional group (or both groups) of the antibiotic. This changes the charge or sterically hinders the antibiotic, decreasing its ribosomal binding affinity. In \"S. aureus\", the best-characterized aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme is aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase 4' IA (\"ANT(4')IA\"). This enzyme has been solved by X-ray crystallography. The enzyme is able to attach an adenyl moiety to the 4' hydroxyl group of many aminoglycosides, including kamamycin and gentamicin.\nGlycopeptide resistance is mediated by acquisition of the \"vanA\" gene, which originates from the Tn1546 transposon found in a plasmid in enterococci and codes for an enzyme that produces an alternative peptidoglycan to which vancomycin will not bind.\nToday, \"S. aureus\" has become resistant to many commonly used antibiotics. In the UK, only 2% of all \"S. aureus\" isolates are sensitive to penicillin, with a similar picture in the rest of the world. The \u03b2-lactamase-resistant penicillins (methicillin, oxacillin, cloxacillin, and flucloxacillin) were developed to treat penicillin-resistant \"S. aureus\", and are still used as first-line treatment. Methicillin was the first antibiotic in this class to be used (it was introduced in 1959), but, only two years later, the first case of methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\" (MRSA) was reported in England.\nDespite this, MRSA generally remained an uncommon finding, even in hospital settings, until the 1990s, when the MRSA prevalence in hospitals exploded, and it is now endemic. Now, methicillin-resistant \"Staphylococcus aureus\" (MRSA) is not only a human pathogen causing a variety of infections, such as skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI), pneumonia, and sepsis, but it also can cause disease in animals, known as livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA).\nMRSA infections in both the hospital and community setting are commonly treated with non-\u03b2-lactam antibiotics, such as clindamycin (a lincosamine) and co-trimoxazole (also commonly known as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole). Resistance to these antibiotics has also led to the use of new, broad-spectrum anti-Gram-positive antibiotics, such as linezolid, because of its availability as an oral drug. First-line treatment for serious invasive infections due to MRSA is currently glycopeptide antibiotics (vancomycin and teicoplanin). A number of problems with these antibiotics occur, such as the need for intravenous administration (no oral preparation is available), toxicity, and the need to monitor drug levels regularly by blood tests. Also, glycopeptide antibiotics do not penetrate very well into infected tissues (this is a particular concern with infections of the brain and meninges and in endocarditis). Glycopeptides must not be used to treat methicillin-sensitive \"S. aureus\" (MSSA), as outcomes are inferior.\nBecause of the high level of resistance to penicillins and because of the potential for MRSA to develop resistance to vancomycin, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published guidelines for the appropriate use of vancomycin. In situations where the incidence of MRSA infections is known to be high, the attending physician may choose to use a glycopeptide antibiotic until the identity of the infecting organism is known. After the infection is confirmed to be due to a methicillin-susceptible strain of \"S. aureus\", treatment can be changed to flucloxacillin or even penicillin, as appropriate.\nVancomycin-resistant \"S. aureus\" (VRSA) is a strain of \"S. aureus\" that has become resistant to the glycopeptides. The first case of vancomycin-intermediate \"S. aureus\" (VISA) was reported in Japan in 1996; but the first case of \"S. aureus\" truly resistant to glycopeptide antibiotics was only reported in 2002. Three cases of VRSA infection had been reported in the United States as of 2005. At least in part the antimicrobial resistance in \"S. aureus\" can be explained by its ability to adapt. Multiple two component signal transduction pathways helps \"S. aureus\" to express genes that are required to survive under antimicrobial stress.\nCarriage.\nAbout 33% of the U.S. population are carriers of \"S. aureus\" and about 2% carry MRSA. Even healthcare providers can be MRSA colonizers.\nThe carriage of \"S. aureus\" is an important source of hospital-acquired infection (also called nosocomial) and community-acquired MRSA. Although \"S. aureus\" can be present on the skin of the host, a large proportion of its carriage is through the anterior nares of the nasal passages and can further be present in the ears. The ability of the nasal passages to harbour \"S. aureus\" results from a combination of a weakened or defective host immunity and the bacterium's ability to evade host innate immunity. Nasal carriage is also implicated in the occurrence of staph infections.\nInfection control.\nSpread of \"S. aureus\" (including MRSA) generally is through human-to-human contact, although recently some veterinarians have discovered the infection can be spread through pets, with environmental contamination thought to play a relatively less important part. Emphasis on basic hand washing techniques are, therefore, effective in preventing its transmission. The use of disposable aprons and gloves by staff reduces skin-to-skin contact, so further reduces the risk of transmission.\nRecently, myriad cases of \"S. aureus\" have been reported in hospitals across America. Transmission of the pathogen is facilitated in medical settings where healthcare worker hygiene is insufficient. \"S. aureus\" is an incredibly hardy bacterium, as was shown in a study where it survived on polyester for just under three months; polyester is the main material used in hospital privacy curtains.\nThe bacteria are transported on the hands of healthcare workers, who may pick them up from a seemingly healthy patient carrying a benign or commensal strain of \"S. aureus\", and then pass it on to the next patient being treated. Introduction of the bacteria into the bloodstream can lead to various complications, including endocarditis, meningitis, and, if it is widespread, sepsis.\nEthanol has proven to be an effective topical sanitizer against MRSA. Quaternary ammonium can be used in conjunction with ethanol to increase the duration of the sanitizing action. The prevention of nosocomial infections involves routine and terminal cleaning. Nonflammable alcohol vapor in NAV-CO2 systems have an advantage, as they do not attack metals or plastics used in medical environments, and do not contribute to antibacterial resistance.\nAn important and previously unrecognized means of community-associated MRSA colonization and transmission is during sexual contact.\n\"S. aureus\" is killed in one minute at 78\u00a0\u00b0C and in ten minutes at 64\u00a0\u00b0C but is resistant to freezing.\nCertain strains of \"S. aureus\" have been described as being resistant to chlorine disinfection\nThe use of mupirocin ointment can reduce the rate of infections due to nasal carriage of \"S. aureus.\" There is limited evidence that nasal decontamination of \"S. aureus\" using antibiotics or antiseptics can reduce the rates of surgical site infections.\nResearch.\nAs of 2021, no approved vaccine exists against \"S. aureus\". Early clinical trials have been conducted for several vaccines candidates such as Nabi's StaphVax and PentaStaph, Intercell's / Merck's V710, VRi's SA75, and others.\nWhile some of these vaccines candidates have shown immune responses, others aggravated an infection by \"S. aureus\". To date, none of these candidates provides protection against a \"S. aureus\" infection. The development of Nabi's StaphVax was stopped in 2005 after phase III trials failed. Intercell's first V710 vaccine variant was terminated during phase II/III after higher mortality and morbidity were observed among patients who developed \"S. aureus\" infection.\nNabi's enhanced \"S. aureus\" vaccines candidate PentaStaph was sold in 2011 to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals S.A. The current status of PentaStaph is unclear. A WHO document indicates that PentaStaph failed in the phase III trial stage.\nIn 2010, GlaxoSmithKline started a phase 1 blind study to evaluate its GSK2392103A vaccine. As of 2016, this vaccine is no longer under active development.\nPfizer's \"S. aureus\" four-antigen vaccine SA4Ag was granted fast track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February 2014. In 2015, Pfizer has commenced a phase 2b trial regarding the SA4Ag vaccine. Phase 1 results published in February 2017 showed a very robust and secure immunogenicity of SA4Ag. The vaccine underwent clinical trial until June 2019, with results published in September 2020, that did not demonstrate a significant reduction in Postoperative Bloodstream Infection after Surgery.\nIn 2015, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics, a former division of Novartis and now part of GlaxoSmithKline, published promising pre-clinical results of their four-component \"Staphylococcus aureus\" vaccine, 4C-staph.\nIn 2020, essential oil, extracted by hydrodistillation from the leaves of Myrciaria pilosa was found to have potential as an antimicrobial drug to control infection by multi-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus.\nStandard strains.\nA number of standard strains of \"S. aureus\" (called \"type cultures\") are used in research and in laboratory testing."}
{"title": "Reactive_attachment_disorder", "label": "Disease", "text": "Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) is described in clinical literature as a severe and relatively uncommon disorder that can affect children, although these issues do occasionally persist into adulthood. RAD is characterized by markedly disturbed and developmentally inappropriate ways of relating socially in most contexts. It can take the form of a persistent failure to initiate or respond to most social interactions in a developmentally appropriate way\u2014known as the \"inhibited form\". In the DSM-5, the \"disinhibited form\" is considered a separate diagnosis named \"disinhibited attachment disorder\".\nRAD arises from a failure to form normal attachments to primary caregivers in early childhood. Such a failure could result from severe early experiences of neglect, abuse, abrupt separation from caregivers between the ages of six months and three years, frequent changes of caregivers, or a lack of caregiver responsiveness to a child's communicative efforts. Not all, or even a majority of such experiences, result in the disorder. It is differentiated from pervasive developmental disorder or developmental delay and from possibly comorbid conditions such as intellectual disability, all of which can affect attachment behavior. The criteria for a diagnosis of a reactive attachment \"disorder\" are very different from the criteria used in assessment or categorization of attachment \"styles\" such as insecure or disorganized attachment.\nChildren with RAD are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal working models of relationships that may lead to interpersonal and behavioral difficulties in later life. There are few studies of long-term effects, and there is a lack of clarity about the presentation of the disorder beyond the age of five years. However, the opening of orphanages in Eastern Europe following the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s provided opportunities for research on infants and toddlers brought up in very deprived conditions. Such research broadened the understanding of the prevalence, causes, mechanism and assessment of disorders of attachment and led to efforts from the late 1990s onwards to develop treatment and prevention programs and better methods of assessment. Mainstream theorists in the field have proposed that a broader range of conditions arising from problems with attachment should be defined beyond current classifications.\nMainstream treatment and prevention programs that target RAD and other problematic early attachment behaviors are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. Most such strategies are in the process of being evaluated. Mainstream practitioners and theorists have presented significant criticism of the diagnosis and treatment of alleged reactive attachment disorder or the theoretically baseless \"attachment disorder\" within the controversial form of psychotherapy commonly known as attachment therapy. Attachment therapy has a scientifically unsupported theoretical base and uses diagnostic criteria or symptom lists markedly different from criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. A range of treatment approaches are used in attachment \"therapy\", some of which are physically and psychologically coercive, and considered to be antithetical to attachment \"theory\".\nSigns and symptoms.\nPediatricians are often the first health professionals to assess and raise suspicions of RAD in children with the disorder. The initial presentation varies according to the child's developmental and chronological age, although it always involves a disturbance in social interaction. Infants up to about 18\u201324 months \"may\" present with non-organic failure to thrive and display abnormal responsiveness to stimuli. Laboratory investigations will be unremarkable barring possible findings consistent with malnutrition or dehydration, while serum growth hormone levels will be normal or elevated.\nThe core feature is severely inappropriate social relating by affected children. This can manifest itself in three ways:\nWhile RAD occurs in relation to neglectful and abusive treatment, automatic diagnoses on this basis alone cannot be made, as children can form stable attachments and social relationships despite marked abuse and neglect. However, the instances of that ability are rare.\nThe name of the disorder emphasizes problems with attachment but the criteria include symptoms such as failure to thrive, a lack of developmentally appropriate social responsiveness, apathy, and onset before 8 months.\nAssessment tools.\nThere is as yet no universally accepted diagnostic protocol for reactive attachment disorder. Often a range of measures is used in research and diagnosis. Recognized assessment methods of attachment styles, difficulties or disorders include the Strange Situation Procedure (devised by developmental psychologist Mary Ainsworth), the separation and reunion procedure and the Preschool Assessment of Attachment, the Observational Record of the Caregiving Environment, the Attachment Q-sort and a variety of narrative techniques using stem stories, puppets or pictures. For older children, actual interviews such as the Child Attachment Interview and the Autobiographical Emotional Events Dialogue can be used. Caregivers may also be assessed using procedures such as the Working Model of the Child Interview.\nMore recent research also uses the Disturbances of Attachment Interview (DAI) developed by Smyke and Zeanah (1999). The DAI is a semi-structured interview designed to be administered by clinicians to caregivers. It covers 12 items, namely \"having a discriminated, preferred adult\", \"seeking comfort when distressed\", \"responding to comfort when offered\", \"social and emotional reciprocity\", \"emotional regulation\", \"checking back after venturing away from the care giver\", \"reticence with unfamiliar adults\", \"willingness to go off with relative strangers\", \"self-endangering behavior\", \"excessive clinging\", \"vigilance/hypercompliance\" and \"role reversal\". This method is designed to pick up not only RAD but also the proposed new alternative categories of disorders of attachment.\nCauses.\nAlthough increasing numbers of childhood mental health problems are being attributed to genetic defects, reactive attachment disorder is by definition based on a problematic history of care and social relationships. Abuse can occur alongside the required factors, but on its own does not explain attachment disorder. It has been suggested that types of temperament, or constitutional response to the environment, may make some individuals susceptible to the stress of unpredictable or hostile relationships with caregivers in the early years. In the absence of available and responsive caregivers it appears that most children are particularly vulnerable to developing attachment disorders.\nWhile similar abnormal parenting may produce the two distinct forms of the disorder, inhibited and disinhibited, studies show that abuse and neglect were far more prominent and severe in the cases of RAD, disinhibited type. The issue of temperament and its influence on the development of attachment disorders has yet to be resolved. RAD has never been reported in the absence of serious environmental adversity yet outcomes for children raised in the same environment are the same.\nIn discussing the neurobiological basis for attachment and trauma symptoms in a seven-year twin study, it has been suggested that the roots of various forms of psychopathology, including RAD, borderline personality disorder (BPD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), can be found in disturbances in affect regulation. The subsequent development of higher-order self-regulation is jeopardized and the formation of internal models is affected. Consequently, the \"templates\" in the mind that drive organized behavior in relationships may be impacted. The potential for \"re-regulation\" (modulation of emotional responses to within the normal range) in the presence of \"corrective\" experiences (normative caregiving) seems possible.\nDiagnosis.\nRAD is one of the least researched and most poorly understood disorders in the DSM. There is little systematic epidemiologic information on RAD, its course is not well established and it appears difficult to diagnose accurately. There is a lack of clarity about the presentation of attachment disorders over the age of five years and difficulty in distinguishing between aspects of attachment disorders, disorganized attachment or the consequences of maltreatment.\nAccording to the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP), children who exhibit signs of reactive attachment disorder need a comprehensive psychiatric assessment and individualized treatment plan. The signs or symptoms of RAD may also be found in other psychiatric disorders and AACAP advises against giving a child this label or diagnosis without a comprehensive evaluation. Their practice parameter states that the assessment of reactive attachment disorder requires evidence directly obtained from serial observations of the child interacting with his or her primary caregivers and history (as available) of the child's patterns of attachment behavior with these caregivers. It also requires observations of the child's behavior with unfamiliar adults and a comprehensive history of the child's early caregiving environment including, for example, pediatricians, teachers, or caseworkers. In the US, initial evaluations may be conducted by psychologists, psychiatrists, Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists, Licensed Professional Counselors, specialist Licensed Clinical Social Workers or psychiatric nurses.\nIn the UK, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering (BAAF) advise that only a psychiatrist can diagnose an attachment disorder and that any assessment must include a comprehensive evaluation of the child's individual and family history.\nAccording to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the question of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines to such an extent that early attachment experiences are only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.\nCriteria.\nICD-10 describes reactive attachment disorder of childhood, known as RAD, and disinhibited attachment disorder, less well known as DAD. DSM-IV-TR also describes reactive attachment disorder of infancy or early childhood divided into two subtypes, inhibited type and disinhibited type, both known as RAD. The two classifications are similar and both include:\nICD-10 states in relation to the inhibited form only that the syndrome probably occurs as a direct result of severe parental neglect, abuse, or serious mishandling. DSM states in relation to both forms there must be a history of \"pathogenic care\" defined as persistent disregard of the child's basic emotional or physical needs or repeated changes in primary caregiver that prevents the formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment that is presumed to account for the disorder. For this reason, part of the diagnosis is the child's history of care rather than observation of symptoms.\nIn DSM-IV-TR the \"inhibited\" form is described as persistent failure to initiate or respond in a developmentally appropriate fashion to most social interactions, as manifest by excessively inhibited, hypervigilant, or highly ambivalent and contradictory responses (e.g., the child may respond to caregivers with a mixture of approach, avoidance, and resistance to comforting or may exhibit \"frozen watchfulness\", hypervigilance while keeping an impassive and still demeanour). Such infants do not seek or accept comfort at times of threat, alarm or distress, thus failing to maintain \"proximity\", an essential element of attachment behavior. The \"disinhibited\" form shows diffuse attachments as manifest by indiscriminate sociability with marked inability to exhibit appropriate selective attachments (e.g., excessive familiarity with relative strangers or lack of selectivity in choice of attachment figures). There is therefore a lack of \"specificity\" of attachment figure, the second basic element of attachment behavior.\nThe ICD-10 descriptions are comparable save that ICD-10 includes in its description several elements not included in DSM-IV-TR as follows:\nThe first of these is somewhat controversial, being a commission rather than omission and because abuse in and of itself does not lead to attachment disorder.\nThe inhibited form has a greater tendency to ameliorate with an appropriate caregiver, while the disinhibited form is more enduring. ICD-10 states the disinhibited form \"tends to persist despite marked changes in environmental circumstances\". Disinhibited and inhibited are not opposites in terms of attachment disorder and can coexist in the same child. The question of whether there are two subtypes has been raised. The World Health Organization acknowledges that there is uncertainty regarding the diagnostic criteria and the appropriate subdivision. One reviewer has commented on the difficulty of clarifying the core characteristics of and differences between atypical attachment styles and ways of categorizing more severe disorders of attachment.\n, the American Psychiatric Association has proposed to redefine RAD into two distinct disorders in the DSM-V. Corresponding with the inhibited type, one disorder will be reclassified as \"Reactive Attachment Disorder of Infancy and Early Childhood\".\nIn regards to pathogenic care, or the type of care in which these behaviors are present, a new criterion for Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder now includes chronically harsh punishment or other types of severely inept caregiving. Relating to pathogenic care for both proposed disorders, a new criterion is rearing in atypical environments such as institutions with high child/caregiver ratios that cut down on opportunities to form attachments with a caregiver.\nDifferential diagnosis.\nThe diagnostic complexities of RAD mean that careful diagnostic evaluation by a trained mental health expert with particular expertise in differential diagnosis is considered essential. Several other disorders, such as conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD, leading to over and under diagnosis. RAD can also be confused with neuropsychiatric disorders such as autism, pervasive developmental disorder, childhood schizophrenia and some genetic syndromes. Infants with this disorder can be distinguished from those with organic illness by their rapid physical improvement after hospitalization. Autistic children are likely to be of normal size and weight and often exhibit a degree of intellectual disability. They are unlikely to improve upon being removed from the home.\nAlternative diagnosis.\nIn the absence of a standardized diagnosis system, many popular, informal classification systems or checklists, outside the DSM and ICD, were created out of clinical and parental experience within the field known as attachment therapy. These lists are unvalidated and critics state they are inaccurate, too broadly defined or applied by unqualified persons. Many are found on the websites of attachment therapists. Common elements of these lists such as lying, lack of remorse or conscience and cruelty do not form part of the diagnostic criteria under either DSM-IV-TR or ICD-10. Many children are being diagnosed with RAD because of behavioral problems that are outside the criteria. There is an emphasis within attachment therapy on aggressive behavior as a symptom of what they describe as attachment disorder whereas mainstream theorists view these behaviors as comorbid, externalizing behaviors requiring appropriate assessment and treatment rather than attachment disorders. However, knowledge of attachment relationships can contribute to the cause, maintenance and treatment of externalizing disorders.\nThe Randolph Attachment Disorder Questionnaire or RADQ is one of the better known of these checklists and is used by attachment therapists and others. The checklist includes 93 discrete behaviours, many of which either overlap with other disorders, like conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, or are not related to attachment difficulties. Critics assert that it is unvalidated and lacks specificity.\nTreatment.\nAssessing the child's safety is an essential first step that determines whether future intervention can take place in the family unit or whether the child should be removed to a safe situation. Interventions may include psychosocial support services for the family unit (including financial or domestic aid, housing and social work support), psychotherapeutic interventions (including treating parents for mental illness, family therapy, individual therapy), education (including training in basic parenting skills and child development), and monitoring of the child's safety within the family environment\nIn 2005 the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry laid down guidelines (devised by N.W. Boris and C.H. Zeanah) based on its published parameters for the diagnosis and treatment of RAD. Recommendations in the guidelines include the following:\nMainstream prevention programs and treatment approaches for attachment difficulties or disorders for infants and younger children are based on attachment theory and concentrate on increasing the responsiveness and sensitivity of the caregiver, or if that is not possible, placing the child with a different caregiver. These approaches are mostly in the process of being evaluated. The programs invariably include a detailed assessment of the attachment status or caregiving responses of the adult caregiver as attachment is a two-way process involving attachment behavior and caregiver response. Some of these treatment or prevention programs are specifically aimed at foster carers rather than parents, as the attachment behaviors of infants or children with attachment difficulties often do not elicit appropriate caregiver responses. Approaches include \"Watch, wait and wonder,\" manipulation of sensitive responsiveness, modified \"Interaction Guidance\", \"Clinician-Assisted Videofeedback Exposure Sessions (CAVES)\", \"Preschool Parent Psychotherapy\", \"Circle of Security\", \"Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up\" (ABC), the New Orleans Intervention, and parent\u2013child psychotherapy. Other treatment methods include Developmental, Individual-difference, and Relationship-based therapy (DIR, also referred to as Floor Time) by Stanley Greenspan, although DIR is primarily directed to treatment of pervasive developmental disorders.\nThe relevance of these approaches to intervention with fostered and adopted children with RAD or older children with significant histories of maltreatment is unclear.\nAttachment therapy.\nThe terms attachment disorder, attachment problems, and attachment therapy, although increasingly used, have no clear, specific, or consensus definitions. However, the terms and therapies often are applied to children who are maltreated, particularly those in the foster care, kinship care, or adoption systems, and related populations such as children adopted internationally from orphanages.\nOutside the mainstream programs is a form of treatment generally known as attachment therapy, a subset of techniques (and accompanying novel diagnosis) for supposed attachment disorders including RAD. These \"attachment disorders\" use diagnostic criteria or symptom lists different from criteria under ICD-10 or DSM-IV-TR, or to attachment behaviors. Sufferers of \"attachment disorder\" are said to lack empathy and remorse.\nTreatments of this pseudoscientific disorder are called \"Attachment therapy\". In general, these therapies are aimed at adopted or fostered children with a view to creating attachment in these children to their new caregivers. The theoretical base is broadly a combination of regression and catharsis, accompanied by parenting methods which emphasize obedience and parental control. There is considerable criticism of this form of treatment and diagnosis as it is largely unvalidated and has developed outside the scientific mainstream. There is little or no evidence base and techniques vary from non-coercive therapeutic work to more extreme forms of physical, confrontational and coercive techniques, of which the best known are holding therapy, rebirthing, rage-reduction and the Evergreen model. These forms of the therapy may well involve physical restraint, the deliberate provocation of rage and anger in the child by physical and verbal means including deep tissue massage, aversive tickling, enforced eye contact and verbal confrontation, and being pushed to revisit earlier trauma. Critics maintain that these therapies are not within the attachment paradigm, are potentially abusive, and are antithetical to attachment theory. The APSAC Taskforce Report of 2006 notes that many of these therapies concentrate on changing the child rather than the caregiver. Children may be described as \"RADs\", \"Radkids\" or \"Radishes\" and dire predictions may be made as to their supposedly violent futures if they are not treated with attachment therapy. The Mayo Clinic, a well known U.S. non-profit medical practice and medical research group, cautions against consulting with mental health providers who promote these types of methods and offer evidence to support their techniques; to date, this evidence base is not published within reputable medical or mental health journals.\nPrognosis.\nThe AACAP guidelines state that children with reactive attachment disorder are presumed to have grossly disturbed internal models for relating to others. However, the course of RAD is not well studied and there have been few efforts to examine symptom patterns over time. The few existing longitudinal studies (dealing with developmental change with age over a period of time) involve only children from poorly run Eastern European institutions.\nFindings from the studies of children from Eastern European orphanages indicate that persistence of the inhibited pattern of RAD is rare in children adopted out of institutions into normative care-giving environments. However, there is a close association between duration of deprivation and severity of attachment disorder behaviors. The quality of attachments that these children form with subsequent care-givers may be compromised, but they probably no longer meet criteria for inhibited RAD. The same group of studies suggests that a minority of adopted, institutionalized children exhibit persistent indiscriminate sociability even after more normative caregiving environments are provided. Indiscriminate sociability may persist for years, even among children who subsequently exhibit preferred attachment to their new caregivers. Some exhibit hyperactivity and attention problems as well as difficulties in peer relationships. In the only longitudinal study that has followed children with indiscriminate behavior into adolescence, these children were significantly more likely to exhibit poor peer relationships.\nStudies of children who were reared in institutions have suggested that they are inattentive and overactive, no matter what quality of care they received. In one investigation, some institution-reared boys were reported to be inattentive, overactive, and markedly unselective in their social relationships, while girls, foster-reared children, and some institution-reared children were not. It is not yet clear whether these behaviors should be considered as part of disordered attachment.\nThere is one case study on maltreated twins published in 1999 with a follow-up in 2006. This study assessed the twins between the ages of 19 and 36 months, during which time they suffered multiple moves and placements. The paper explores the similarities, differences and comorbidity of RAD, disorganized attachment and post traumatic stress disorder. The girl showed signs of the inhibited form of RAD while the boy showed signs of the indiscriminate form. It was noted that the diagnosis of RAD ameliorated with better care but symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder and signs of disorganized attachment came and went as the infants progressed through multiple placement changes. At age three, some lasting relationship disturbance was evident.\nIn the follow-up case study when the twins were aged three and eight years, the lack of longitudinal research on maltreated as opposed to institutionalized children was again highlighted. The girl's symptoms of disorganized attachment had developed into controlling behaviors\u2014a well-documented outcome. The boy still exhibited self-endangering behaviors, not within RAD criteria but possibly within \"secure base distortion\", (where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment). At age eight the children were assessed with a variety of measures including those designed to access representational systems, or the child's \"internal working models\". The twins' symptoms were indicative of different trajectories. The girl showed externalizing symptoms (particularly deceit), contradictory reports of current functioning, chaotic personal narratives, struggles with friendships, and emotional disengagement with her caregiver, resulting in a clinical picture described as \"quite concerning\". The boy still evidenced self-endangering behaviors as well as avoidance in relationships and emotional expression, separation anxiety and impulsivity and attention difficulties. It was apparent that life stressors had impacted each child differently. The narrative measures used were considered helpful in tracking how early attachment disruption is associated with later expectations about relationships.\nOne paper using questionnaires found that children aged three to six, diagnosed with RAD, scored lower on empathy but higher on self-monitoring (regulating your behavior to \"look good\"). These differences were especially pronounced based on ratings by parents, and suggested that children with RAD may systematically report their personality traits in overly positive ways. Their scores also indicated considerably more behavioral problems than scores of the control children.\nEpidemiology.\nEpidemiological data are limited, but reactive attachment disorder appears to be very uncommon. The prevalence of RAD is unclear but it is probably quite rare, other than in populations of children being reared in the most extreme, deprived settings such as some orphanages. There is little systematically gathered epidemiologic information on RAD. A cohort study of 211 Copenhagen children to the age of 18 months found a prevalence of 0.9%.\nAttachment disorders tend to occur in a definable set of contexts such as within some types of institutions, in the presence of repeated changes of primary caregiver or of extremely neglectful identifiable primary caregivers who show persistent disregard for the child's basic attachment needs, but not all children raised in these conditions develop an attachment disorder. Studies undertaken on children from Eastern European orphanages from the mid-1990s showed significantly higher levels of both forms of RAD and of insecure patterns of attachment in the institutionalized children, regardless of how long they had been there. It would appear that children in institutions like these are unable to form selective attachments to their caregivers. The difference between the institutionalized children and the control group had lessened in the follow-up study three years later, although the institutionalized children continued to show significantly higher levels of indiscriminate friendliness. However, even among children raised in the most deprived institutional conditions the majority did not show symptoms of this disorder.\nA 2002 study of children in residential nurseries in Bucharest, in which the DAI was used, challenged the current DSM and ICD conceptualizations of disordered attachment and showed that inhibited and disinhibited disorders could coexist in the same child.\nThere are two studies on the incidence of RAD relating to high risk and maltreated children in the U.S. Both used ICD, DSM and the DAI. The first, in 2004, reported that children from the maltreatment sample were significantly more likely to meet criteria for one or more attachment disorders than children from the other groups, however this was mainly the proposed new classification of disrupted attachment disorder rather than the DSM or ICD classified RAD or DAD. The second study, also in 2004, attempted to ascertain the prevalence of RAD and whether it could be reliably identified in \"maltreated\" rather than \"neglected\" toddlers. Of the 94 maltreated toddlers in foster care, 35% were identified as having ICD RAD and 22% as having ICD DAD, and 38% fulfilled the DSM criteria for RAD. This study found that RAD could be reliably identified and also that the inhibited and disinhibited forms were not independent. However, there are some methodological concerns with this study. A number of the children identified as fulfilling the criteria for RAD did in fact have a preferred attachment figure.\nIt has been suggested by some within the field of attachment therapy that RAD may be quite prevalent because severe child maltreatment, which is known to increase risk for RAD, is prevalent and because children who are severely abused may exhibit behaviors similar to RAD behaviors. The APSAC Taskforce consider this inference to be flawed and questionable. Severely abused children may exhibit similar behaviors to RAD behaviors but there are several far more common and demonstrably treatable diagnoses which may better account for these difficulties. Further, many children experience severe maltreatment and do not develop clinical disorders. Resilience is a common and normal human characteristic. RAD does not underlie all or even most of the behavioral and emotional problems seen in foster children, adoptive children, or children who are maltreated and rates of child abuse and/or neglect or problem behaviors are not a benchmark for estimates of RAD.\nThere are few data on comorbid conditions, but there are some conditions that arise in the same circumstances in which RAD arises, such as institutionalization or maltreatment. These are principally developmental delays and language disorders associated with neglect. Conduct disorders, oppositional defiant disorder, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and social phobia share many symptoms and are often comorbid with or confused with RAD. Attachment disorder behaviors amongst institutionalized children are correlated with attentional and conduct problems and cognitive levels but nonetheless appear to index a distinct set of symptoms and behaviors.\nHistory.\nReactive attachment disorder first made its appearance in standard nosologies of psychological disorders in DSM-III, 1980, following an accumulation of evidence on institutionalized children. The criteria included a requirement of onset before the age of 8 months and was equated with failure to thrive. Both these features were dropped in DSM-III-R, 1987. Instead, onset was changed to being within the first 5 years of life and the disorder itself was divided into two subcategories, inhibited and disinhibited. These changes resulted from further research on maltreated and institutionalized children and remain in the current version, DSM-IV, 1994, and its 2000 text revision, DSM-IV-TR, as well as in ICD-10, 1992. Both nosologies focus on young children who are not merely at increased risk for subsequent disorders but are already exhibiting clinical disturbance.\nThe broad theoretical framework for current versions of RAD is attachment theory, based on work conducted from the 1940s to the 1980s by John Bowlby, Mary Ainsworth and Ren\u00e9 Spitz. Attachment theory is a framework that employs psychological, ethological and evolutionary concepts to explain social behaviors typical of young children. Attachment theory focuses on the tendency of infants or children to \"seek proximity\" to a \"particular attachment figure\" (familiar caregiver), in situations of alarm or distress, behavior which appears to have survival value. This is known as a discriminatory or selective attachment. Subsequently, the child begins to use the caregiver as a base of security from which to explore the environment, returning periodically to the familiar person. Attachment is not the same as love and/or affection although they are often associated. Attachment and attachment behaviors tend to develop between the ages of six months and three years. Infants become attached to adults who are sensitive and responsive in social interactions with the infant, and who remain as consistent caregivers for some time. Caregiver responses lead to the development of patterns of attachment, that in turn lead to internal working models which will guide the individual's feelings, thoughts, and expectations in later relationships. For a diagnosis of reactive attachment disorder, the child's history and atypical social behavior must suggest the absence of formation of a discriminatory or selective attachment.\nThe pathological absence of a discriminatory or selective attachment needs to be differentiated from the existence of attachments with either typical or somewhat atypical behavior patterns, known as \"styles\" or \"patterns\". There are four attachment styles ascertained and used within developmental attachment research. These are known as \"secure\", \"anxious-ambivalent\", \"anxious-avoidant\", (all \"organized\") and \"disorganized\". The latter three are characterised as \"insecure\". These are assessed using the Strange Situation Procedure, designed to assess the quality of attachments rather than whether an attachment exists at all.\nA securely attached toddler will explore freely while the caregiver is present, engage with strangers, be visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and happy to see the caregiver return. The anxious-ambivalent toddler is anxious of exploration, extremely distressed when the caregiver departs but ambivalent when the caregiver returns. The anxious-avoidant toddler will not explore much, avoid or ignore the parent\u2014showing little emotion when the parent departs or returns\u2014and treat strangers much the same as caregivers with little emotional range shown. The disorganized/disoriented toddler shows a lack of a coherent style or pattern for coping. Evidence suggests this occurs when the caregiving figure is also an object of fear, thus putting the child in an irresolvable situation regarding approach and avoidance. On reunion with the caregiver, these children can look dazed or frightened, freezing in place, backing toward the caregiver or approaching with head sharply averted, or showing other behaviors implying fear of the person who is being sought. It is thought to represent a breakdown of an inchoate attachment strategy and it appears to affect the capacity to regulate emotions.\nAlthough there are a wide range of attachment difficulties within the styles which may result in emotional disturbance and increase the risk of later psychopathologies, particularly the disorganized style, none of the styles constitute a disorder in themselves and none equate to criteria for RAD as such. A disorder in the clinical sense is a condition requiring treatment, as opposed to risk factors for subsequent disorders. Reactive attachment disorder denotes a lack of typical attachment behaviors rather than an attachment style, however problematic that style may be, in that there is an unusual lack of discrimination between familiar and unfamiliar people in both forms of the disorder. Such discrimination does exist as a feature of the social behavior of children with atypical attachment styles. Both DSM-IV and ICD-10 depict the disorder in terms of socially aberrant behavior in general rather than focusing more specifically on attachment behaviors as such. DSM-IV emphasizes a failure to initiate or respond to social interactions across a range of relationships and ICD-10 similarly focuses on contradictory or ambivalent social responses that extend across social situations. The relationship between patterns of attachment in the Strange Situation and RAD is not yet clear.\nThere is a lack of consensus about the precise meaning of the term \"attachment disorder\". The term is frequently used both as an alternative to reactive attachment disorder and in discussions about different proposed classifications for disorders of attachment beyond the limitations of the ICD and DSM classifications. It is also used within the field of attachment therapy, as is the term reactive attachment disorder, to describe a range of problematic behaviors not within the ICD or DSM criteria or not related directly to attachment styles or difficulties at all.\nResearch.\nResearch from the late 1990s indicated there were disorders of attachment not captured by DSM or ICD and showed that RAD could be diagnosed reliably without evidence of pathogenic care, thus illustrating some of the conceptual difficulties with the rigid structure of the current definition of RAD. Research published in 2004 showed that the disinhibited form can endure alongside structured attachment behavior (of any style) towards the child's permanent caregivers.\nSome authors have proposed a broader continuum of definitions of attachment disorders ranging from RAD through various attachment difficulties to the more problematic attachment styles. There is as yet no consensus, on this issue but a new set of practice parameters containing three categories of attachment disorder has been proposed by C.H. Zeanah and N. Boris. The first of these is \"disorder of attachment,\" in which a young child has no preferred adult caregiver. The proposed category of disordered attachment is parallel to RAD in its inhibited and disinhibited forms, as defined in DSM and ICD. The second category is \"secure base distortion\", where the child has a preferred familiar caregiver, but the relationship is such that the child cannot use the adult for safety while gradually exploring the environment. Such children may endanger themselves, cling to the adult, be excessively compliant, or show role reversals in which they care for or punish the adult. The third type is \"disrupted attachment\". Disrupted attachment is not covered under ICD-10 and DSM criteria, and results from an abrupt separation or loss of a familiar caregiver to whom attachment has developed. This form of categorisation may demonstrate more clinical accuracy overall than the current DSM-IV-TR classification, but further research is required. The practice parameters would also provide the framework for a diagnostic protocol. Most recently, Daniel Schechter and Erica Willheim have shown a relationship between some maternal violence-related posttraumatic stress disorder and secure base distortion (see above) which is characterized by child recklessness, separation anxiety, hypervigilance, and role-reversal.\nSome research indicates there may be a significant overlap between behaviors of the inhibited form of RAD or DAD and aspects of disorganized attachment where there is an identified attachment figure.\nAn ongoing question is whether RAD should be thought of as a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into nosologies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver but not with another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.\nThe draft of the proposed DSM-V suggests dividing RAD into two disorders, Reactive Attachment Disorder for the current inhibited form of RAD, and Disinhibited Social Engagement Disorder for what is currently the disinhibited form of RAD, with some alterations in the proposed DSM definition."}
{"title": "Bladder_cancer", "label": "Disease", "text": "Bladder cancer is any of several types of cancer arising from the tissues of the urinary bladder. Symptoms include blood in the urine, pain with urination, and low back pain. It is caused when epithelial cells that line the bladder become malignant. \nRisk factors for bladder cancer include smoking, family history, prior radiation therapy, frequent bladder infections, and exposure to certain chemicals. The most common type is transitional cell carcinoma. Other types include squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. Diagnosis is typically by cystoscopy with tissue biopsies. Staging of the cancer is determined by transurethral resection and medical imaging.\nTreatment depends on the stage of the cancer. It may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or immunotherapy. Surgical options may include transurethral resection, partial or complete removal of the bladder, or urinary diversion. The typical five-year survival rates in the United States is 77%, Canada is 75%, and Europe is 68%.\nBladder cancer, as of 2018, affected about 1.6 million people globally with 549,000 new cases and 200,000 deaths. Age of onset is most often between 65 and 84 years of age. Males are more often affected than females. In 2018, the highest rate of bladder cancer occurred in Southern and Western Europe followed by North America with rates of 15, 13, and 12 cases per 100,000 people. The highest rates of bladder cancer deaths were seen in Northern Africa and Western Asia followed by Southern Europe.\nSigns and symptoms.\nBladder cancer characteristically causes blood in the urine, which may be visible or detectable only by microscope. Blood in the urine is the most common symptom in bladder cancer, and is painless. Visible blood in the urine may be of only short duration, and a urine test may be required to confirm non-visible blood. Between 80 and 90% of people with bladder cancer initially presented with visible blood. Blood in the urine may also be caused by other conditions, such as bladder or ureteric stones, infection, kidney disease, kidney cancers or vascular malformations, though these conditions (except kidney cancers) would typically be painful.\nOther possible symptoms include pain during urination, frequent urination, or feeling the need to urinate without being able to do so. These signs and symptoms are not specific to bladder cancer, and may also be caused by non-cancerous conditions, including prostate infections, overactive bladder or cystitis. Some rare forms of bladder cancer like urachal adenocarcinoma produce mucin, which is then excreted in the urine causing it to be thick.\nPeople with advanced disease may have pelvic or bony pain, lower-extremity swelling, or flank pain. Rarely, a palpable mass can be detected on physical examination.\nCauses.\nTobacco smoking is the main known contributor to urinary bladder cancer; in most populations, smoking is associated with over half of bladder cancer cases in men and one-third of cases among women, however these proportions have reduced over recent years since there are fewer smokers in Europe and North America. There is an almost linear relationship between smoking duration (in years), pack years and bladder cancer risk. A risk plateau at smoking about 15 cigarettes a day can be observed (meaning that those who smoke 15 cigarettes a day are approximately at the same risk as those smoking 30 cigarettes a day). Smoking (cigar, pipe, Egyptian waterpipe and smokeless tobacco) in any form increases the risk for bladder cancer. Quitting smoking reduces the risk. Risk of bladder cancer decreases by 30% within 1\u20134 years and continues to decrease by 60% at 25 years after smoking cessation. However, former smokers will most likely always be at a higher risk of bladder cancer compared to people who have never smoked. Passive smoking also appear to be a risk.\nOpium consumption increases the risk of bladder cancer by 3-fold and concurrent use of opium and smoking increases the risk of bladder cancer by 5 times compared to the general population.\nThirty percent of bladder tumors probably result from occupational exposure in the workplace to carcinogens. Occupational or circumstantial exposure to the following substances has been implicated as a cause of bladder cancer; benzidine (dyes manufacturing), 4-aminobiphenyl (rubber industry), 2-naphtylamine (azo dyes manufacturing, foundry fumes, rubber industry, cigarette smoke and cancer research), phenacetin (analgesic), arsenic and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons in drinking water, auramine (dye manufacturing), magenta (dye manufacturing), ortho-toluidine (dye manufacturing), epoxy and polyurethane resin hardening agents (plastics industry), chlornaphazine, coal-tar pitch. Occupations at risk are bus drivers, rubber workers, painters, motor mechanics, leather (including shoe) workers, blacksmiths, machine setters, and mechanics. Hairdressers are thought to be at risk as well because of their frequent exposure to permanent hair dyes.\nInfection with Schistosoma haematobium (bilharzia or schistosomiasis) may cause bladder cancer, specially of the squamous cell type. Schistosoma eggs induces a chronic inflammatory state in the bladder wall resulting in tissue fibrosis. Higher levels of N-nitroso compounds has been detected in urine samples of people with schistosomiasis. N-Nitroso compounds have been implicated in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis related bladder cancer. They cause alkylation DNA damage, specially Guanine to Adenine transition mutations in the HRAS and p53 tumor suppressor gene. Mutations of p53 are detected in 73% of the tumors, BCL-2 mutations accounting for 32% and the combination of the two accounting for 13%. Other causes of squamous cell carcinoma of the bladder include chronic catheterizations in people with a spinal cord injury and history of treatment with cyclophosphamide.\nIngestion of aristolochic acid present in many Chinese herbal medications has been shown to cause urothelial carcinoma and kidney failure. Aristolochic acid activates peroxidase in the urothelium and causes transversion mutation in the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.\nPeople who undergo external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) for prostate cancer have a higher risk of developing invasive bladder cancer.\nIn addition to these major risk factors there are also numerous other modifiable factors that are less strongly (i.e. 10\u201320% risk increase) associated with bladder cancer, for example, obesity. Although these could be considered as minor effects, risk reduction in the general population could still be achieved by reducing the prevalence of a number of smaller risk factor together.\nGenetics.\nMutations in FGFR3, TP53, PIK3CA, KDM6A, ARID1A, KMT2D, HRAS, TERT, KRAS, CREBBP, RB1 and TSC1 genes may be associated with some cases of bladder cancer. Deletions of parts or whole of chromosome 9 is common in bladder cancer. Low grade cancer are known to harbor mutations in RAS pathway and the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene, both of which play a role in the MAPK/ERK pathway. p53 and RB gene mutations are implicated in high-grade muscle invasive tumors. Eighty nine percent of muscle invasive cancers have mutations in chromatin remodeling and histone modifying genes.\nDeletion of both copies of the GSTM1 gene has a modest increase in risk of bladder cancer. GSTM1 gene product glutathione S-transferase M1 (GSTM1) participates in the detoxification process of carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons found in cigarette smoke. Similarly, mutations in NAT2 (N-acetyltransferase) is associated with increased risk for bladder cancer. N-acetyltransferase helps in detoxification of carcinogens like aromatic amines (also present in cigarette smoke). Various single-nucleotide polymorphisms in PSCA gene present on chromosome 8 have shown to increase the risk for bladder cancer. PSCA gene promoter region has an androgen response region. Loss of reactivity of this region to androgens is hypothesized as a cause of more number of aggressive tumors in women (unlike in men who have higher amount of androgen).\nMuscle invasive bladder cancer are heterogeneous in nature. In general, they can be genetically classified into basal and luminal subtypes. Basal subtype show alterations involving RB and NFE2L2 and luminal type show changes in FGFR3 and KDM6A genes. Basal subtype are subdivided into basal and claudin low-type group and are aggressive and show metastasis at presentation, however they respond to platinum based chemotherapy. Luminal subtype can be subdivided into p53-like and luminal. p53-like tumors of luminal subtype although not as aggressive as basal type, show resistance to chemotherapy\nDiagnosis.\nCurrently, the best diagnosis of the state of the bladder is by way of cystoscopy, which is a procedure in which a flexible or rigid tube (called a \"cystoscope\") bearing a camera and various instruments are inserted into the bladder through the urethra. The flexible procedure allows for a visual inspection of the bladder, for minor remedial work to be undertaken and for samples of suspicious lesions to be taken for a biopsy. A rigid cystoscope is used under general anesthesia in the operating room and can support remedial work and biopsies as well as more extensive tumor removal. Unlike papillary lesion, which grow into the bladder cavity and are readily visible, carcinoma in situ lesion are flat and obscure. Detection of carcinoma in situ lesions requires multiple biopsies from different areas of interior bladder wall. Photodynamic detection (blue light cystoscopy) can aid in the detection of carcinoma in situ. In photodynamic detection, a dye is instilled into the bladder with the help of a catheter. Cancer cells take up this dye and are visible under blue light, providing visual clues on areas to biopsied or resected.\nHowever, visual detection in any form listed above, is not sufficient for establishing pathological classification, cell type or the stage of the present tumor. A so-called cold cup biopsy during an ordinary cystoscopy (rigid or flexible) will not be sufficient for pathological staging either. Hence, a visual detection needs to be followed by transurethral surgery. The procedure is called transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Further, a rectal and vaginal bimanual examination should be carried out before and after the TURBT to assess whether there is a palpable mass or if the tumour is fixed (\"tethered\") to the pelvic wall. The pathological classification and staging information obtained by the TURBT-procedure, is of fundamental importance for making the appropriate choice of ensuing treatment and/or follow-up routines.\nIf invasive or high grade (includes carcinoma in situ) cancer is detected on TURBT, an MRI and/or CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis or urogram and CT chest or x-ray chest should be conducted for disease staging and to look for cancer spread (metastasis). Increase in alkaline phosphatase levels without evidence of liver disease should be evaluated for bone metastasis by a bone scan. Although 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)/CT has been explored as a viable method for staging, there is no consensus to support its role in routine clinical evaluations.\nUrine cytology can be obtained in voided urine or at the time of the cystoscopy (\"bladder washing\"). Cytology is not very sensitive for low-grade or grade 1 tumors (a negative result cannot reliably exclude bladder cancer) but has a high specificity (a positive result reliably detects bladder cancer). There are newer non-invasive urine bound markers available as aids in the diagnosis of bladder cancer, including human complement factor H-related protein, high-molecular-weight carcinoembryonic antigen, and nuclear matrix protein 22 (NMP22). In United States the FDA has approved NMP22, NMP22 BladderChek, and UroVysion tests for detection and surveillance of bladder cancer and ImmunoCyt, BTA-TRAK, and BTA-STAT tests have been approved for surveillance only. BTA-STAT and BladderChek can be performed in the clinic and others are done in the laboratory. Other non-invasive urine based tests include the CertNDx Bladder Cancer Assay, which detects FGFR3 mutation and Urine Bladder Cancer test (UBC), which is a sandwich ELISA for Cytokeratin 8/18 fragment. Likewise, NMP22 is a sandwich ELISA and NMP22 BladderChek is a dipstick immunoassay, both of them detect nuclear mitotic apparatus protein (NuMA) tumor marker (a type of nuclear matrix protein). UroVysion is a fluorescence in situ hybridization which detects aneuploidy in chromosomes 3, 7, 17 and loss of the 9p21 locus. ImmunoCyt is an Immunofluorescence test which detects glycosylated CEA and MUCIN-like antigens (M344, LDQ10, 19A11). BTA-STAT is a dipstick immunoassay for detection of human complement factor H-related protein. BTA-TRAK is a sandwich ELISA which also detects human complement factor H-related protein. Sensitivities across biomarkers ranged from 0.57 to 0.82 and specificities from 0.74 to 0.88. Biomarkers fared better when used in combination with urine cytology than when used alone. However, detection accuracy is poor for low grade cancers and 10% cancers are still missed. Current guidelines do not recommended using urinary biomarkers for detection and surveillance.\nClassification.\nNon-papillary carcinoma includes carcinoma in situ (CIS), microinvasive carcinoma and frankly invasive carcinoma. Carcinoma \"in situ\" (CIS) invariably consists of cytologically high-grade tumour cells.\nTransitional cell carcinoma can undergo differentiation (25%) into its variants. When seen under a microscope, papillary transitional cell carcinoma can present in its typical form or as one of its variations (squamous, glandular differentiation or micropapillary variant). Different variations of non-papillary transitional cell carcinoma are listed below.\nStaging.\nBladder cancer is staged (classified by the extent of spread of the cancer) and graded (how abnormal and aggressive the cells appear under the microscope) to determine treatments and estimate outcomes. Staging usually follows the first transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT). Papillary tumors confined to the mucosa or which invade the lamina propria are classified as Ta or T1. Flat lesion are classified as Tis. Both are grouped together as non-muscle invasive disease for therapeutic purposes.\nIn the TNM staging system (8th Edn. 2017) for bladder cancer:\nT (Primary tumour)\nN (Lymph nodes)\nM (Distant metastasis)\nThe most common sites for bladder cancer metastases are the lymph nodes, bones, lung, liver, and peritoneum. The most common sentinel lymph nodes draining bladder cancer are obturator and internal iliac lymph nodes. The location of lymphatic spread depends on the location of the tumors. Tumors on the superolateral bladder wall spread to external iliac lymph nodes. Tumors on the neck, anterior wall and fundus spread commonly to the internal iliac lymph nodes. From the regional lymph nodes (i.e. obturator, internal and external lymph nodes) the cancer spreads to distant sites like the common iliac lymph nodes and paraaortic lymph nodes. Skipped lymph node lesions are not seen in bladder cancer.\nNumerical\n&lt;br&gt;The stages above can be integrated into a numerical staging (with Roman numerals) as follows:\nGrading.\nAccording to WHO classification (1973) bladder cancers are histologically graded into:\nWHO classification (2004/2016)\nRisk stratification.\nPeople with non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), are risk-stratified based on clinical and pathological factors so that they are treated appropriately depending on their probability of having progression and/or recurrence. People with non-muscle invasive tumors are categorized into low-risk, intermediate-risk and high-risk or provided with a numerical risk score. Risk-stratification framework is provided by American Urology Association/Society of Urological Oncology (AUA/SUO stratification), European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) risk tables and Club Urol\u00f3gico Espa\u00f1ol de Tratamiento Oncol\u00f3gico (CUETO) scoring model.\nThe EORTC and CUETO model use a cumulative score obtained from individual prognostic factors, which are then converted into risk of progression and recurrence. The six prognostic factors included in the EORTC model are number of tumors, recurrence rate, T-stage, presence of carcinoma-in-situ and grade of the tumor. Scoring for recurrence in the CUETO model incorporates 6 variables; age, gender, grade, tumor status, number of tumors and presence of tis. For progression scoring the previous 6 variables plus T stage is used.\nPrevention.\nAs of 2019, there is limited high level evidence to suggest that eating vegetable and fruits decreases the risk of bladder cancer. A 2008 study concluded that \"specific fruit and vegetables may act to reduce the risk of bladder cancer.\" Fruit and yellow-orange vegetables, particularly carrots and those containing selenium, are probably associated with a moderately reduced risk of bladder cancer. Citrus fruits and cruciferous vegetables were also identified as having a possibly protective effect. However an analysis of 47,909 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study showed little relation between cancer reduction and high consumption of fruits and vegetables overall, or yellow or green leafy vegetables specifically, compared to the reduction seen among those men who consumed large amounts of cruciferous vegetables. An inverse relation between in-takes of flavonols and lignans (diphenolic compounds found in whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables) and aggressive bladder cancer has also been described.\nWhile it is suggested that the polyphenol compounds in tea may have an inhibitory effect on bladder tumor formation and growth, there is limited evidence to suggesting drinking tea decreases bladder cancer risk.\nIn a 10-year study involving almost 49,000 men, researchers found that men who drank at least 1.44 L of water (around 6 cups) per day had a reduced risk of bladder cancer when compared with men who drank less. It was also found that: \"the risk of bladder cancer decreased by 7% for every 240 mL of fluid added\". The authors proposed that bladder cancer might partly be caused by the bladder directly contacting carcinogens that are excreted in urine, although this has not yet been confirmed in other studies.\nScreening.\nAs of 2019 there is insufficient evidence to determine if screening for bladder cancer in people without symptoms is effective or not.\nTreatment.\nThe treatment of bladder cancer depends on how deeply the tumor invades into the bladder wall.\nTreatment strategies for bladder cancer include:\nNon-muscle invasive.\nTransurethral resection.\nNon-muscle invasive bladder cancer (those not entering the muscle layer of the bladder) can be \"shaved off\" using an electrocautery device attached to a cystoscope, which in that case is called a resectoscope. The procedure is called transurethral resection of bladder tumor (TURBT) and serves primarily for pathological staging. In case of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer the TURBT is in itself the treatment, but in case of muscle invasive cancer, the procedure is insufficient for final treatment. Additionally, blue light cystoscopy with optical-imaging agent Hexaminolevulinate (HAL) is recommended at initial TURBT to increase lesion detection (especially carcinoma in situ) and improve resection quality thereby reducing recurrence. It is important to assess the quality of the resection, if there is evidence of incomplete resection or there is no muscle in the specimen (without which muscle invasiveness cannot be determined) a second TURBT is strongly recommended. Moreover, nearly half of the people with high grade non-invasive disease have residual tumor after primary TURBT, in such cases a second TURBT is important for avoiding under-staging. At this point classifying people into risk groups is recommended. Treatment and surveillance for different risk groups is indicated in the table below.\nAnother method for reducing recurrence of tumors is medication after TURBT surgery. The two most common medicines used for this purpose are Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) and mitomycin. For people who have already had a TURBT procedure, BCG may lead to similar risk of death and may reduce the risk of tumor recurrence. However, this medication may increase the risk of serious unwanted side effects. More research is needed to confirm these results.\nChemotherapy.\nA single instillation of chemotherapy into the bladder after primary TURBT has shown benefit in deceasing recurrence by 35% in non-muscle invasive disease. Medications which can used for this purpose are mitomycin C (MMC), epirubicin, pirarubicin and gemcitabine. Instillation of post-operative chemotherapy should be conducted within first few hours after TURBT. As time progress residual tumor cells are known to adhere firmly and are covered by extracellular matrix which decrease the efficacy of the instillation. The most common side effect is chemical cystitis and skin irritation. If there is a suspicion of bladder perforation during TURBT, chemotherapy should not be instilled into the bladder as serious adverse events are known to occur due to drug extravasation. Studies have shown that efficacy of chemotherapy is increased by the use of Device assisted chemotherapy . These technologies use different mechanisms to facilitate the absorption and action of a chemotherapy drug instilled directly into the bladder. Another technology \u2013 electromotive drug administration (EMDA) \u2013 uses an electric current to enhance drug absorption after surgical removal of the tumor. Another technology, thermotherapy, uses radio-frequency energy to directly heat the bladder wall, which together with chemotherapy (chemohyperthermia) shows a synergistic effect, enhancing each other's capacity to kill tumor cells.\nImmunotherapy.\nImmunotherapy by Bacillus Calmette\u2013Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) delivery into the bladder is also used to treat and prevent the recurrence of NMIBC. BCG is a vaccine against tuberculosis that is prepared from attenuated (weakened) live bovine tuberculosis bacillus, Mycobacterium bovis, that has lost its virulence in humans. BCG immunotherapy is effective in up to 2/3 of the cases at this stage, and in randomized trials has been shown to be superior to standard chemotherapy. The exact mechanism by which BCG prevents recurrence is unknown. However, it has been shown that the bacteria are taken up by the cancer cells. The infection of these cells in the bladder may trigger a localized immune reaction which clears residual cancer cells.\nBCG is delivered as induction and a maintenance course. The induction course consists of 6-week course of intravesical and percutaneous BCG. This is followed by a maintenance course. There is no consensus regarding the maintenance schedule, however the most commonly followed is the Southwestern Oncology Group (SWOG) schedule. The SWOG maintenance schedule consists of intravesical and percutaneous BCG every week for 3 weeks given at 3, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months. Three weekly maintenance regimen with induction has shown complete response rate of 84% compared to 69% in people who received 6-week induction BCG only at 6 months. Many studies have explored alternate treatment schedules and regimes of BCG but has shown no clinical significance. Efficacy of different strains of BCG (Connaught, TICE, Pasteur, Tokio-172) has been shown not to be different however, there is no high-level evidence.\nSide effects of BCG therapy include cystitis, prostatitis, epididymo-orchitis, balanitis, ureteral obstruction, bladder contraction, mycobacterial osteomyelitis, reactive arthritis, mycobacterial pneumonia, granulomatous hepatitis, granulomatous nephritis, interstitial nephritis, infectious vasculitis and disseminated infection.\nLocal infection (i.e. prostatitis, epididymo-orchitis, balanitis) because of BCG should be treated with triple tubercular therapy, with one of the drug being fluoroquinolone for 3 to 6 months. In people with systemic infections, BCG therapy should be stopped and anti-tubercular multidrug treatment for at-least 6 months should be started. Medications that can be used for this treatment are INH, rifampicin, ethambutol, fluoroquinolones, clarithromycin, aminoglycosides, and doxycycline. BCG strains are not sensitive to pyrazinamide therefore, it should not be a part of anti-tubercular treatment.\nBCG treatment failure.\nBCG treatment failure can be classified into 3 groups; BCG relapse, BCG-refractory and BCG-intolerant. In BCG relapse, tumor reoccurs after a disease free period. BCG-refractory tumors are the ones which do not respond to induction and maintenance doses of BCG or which progress during therapy. In BCG-intolerant, tumor reoccurs due to incomplete treatment as the person receiving it is unable to tolerate an induction course of BCG. Around 50% of the people fail BCG treatment and would require further treatment.\nPeople whose tumors recurred after treatment with BCG or who were unresponsive to treatment, are more difficult to treat. In such people a radical cystectomy is recommendation In people who do not show response to BCG therapy and are unfit or unwilling to undergo radical cystectomy, salvage therapies can be considered. Salvage therapy include intravesical chemotherapy with agents such as valrubicin, gemcitabine or docetaxel, chemoradiation or chemohyperthermia.\nMuscle invasive.\nMultimodal therapy (standard treatment).\nUntreated, non-muscle invasive tumors may gradually begin to infiltrate the muscular wall of the bladder (muscle invasive bladder cancer). Tumors that infiltrate the bladder wall require more radical surgery, where part (partial cystectomy) or all (radical cystectomy) of the bladder is removed (a cystectomy) and the urinary stream is diverted into an isolated bowel loop (called an ileal conduit or urostomy). In some cases, skilled surgeons can create a substitute bladder (a neobladder) from a segment of intestinal tissue, but this largely depends upon a person's preference, age of the person, renal function, and the site of the disease.\nA bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy should accompany radical cystectomy. At minimum, a standard template of lymphadenectomy should be followed by removing the external and internal iliac and obturator lymph node. When performing a lymphadenectomy, the surgeon can either remove lymph nodes from a smaller (standard) or from larger (extended) area. In comparison with a standard lymph node dissection, having an extended dissection may reduce a person\u2019s likelihood of death from any reason, including dying from bladder cancer. The extended procedure may lead to more serious unwanted effects and may or may not influence the likelihood of the cancer recurring over time. The rate of not-so-serious side effects may be similar for both surgeries.\nRadical cystectomy has a significant morbidity associated with it. About 50-65% of the people experience complication within 90 days of surgery. Mortality rates was 7% within 90 days of surgery. High volume centers have better outcomes than low volume centers. Some centers are implementing Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) society recommendations to decrease morbidity after radical cystectomy. However, due to lack of specific evidence in urologic surgery, ERAS protocol has not been widely incorporated in urologic clinical care.\nEven after surgical removal of bladder, 50% of the people with muscle invasive disease (T2-T4) develop metastatic disease within two years due to micrometastasis. In such, neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy before main treatment, i.e. surgery) has shown to increase overall survival at 5 years from 45% to 50% with an absolute survival benefit of 5%. Currently the two most used chemotherapy regimens for neoadjuvant chemotherapy are platinum based; methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin (MVAC) and gemcitabine with cisplatin (GC). Other regimens include dose dense MVAC (DDMVC) and cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastine (CMV).\nAlthough, the optimal regimen has not been established, the preferred regimen for neoadjuvant therapy is MVAC.\nRole of adjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy after main treatment) is limited to people with high grade tumours (pT3/T4and/or N+) and who have not been treated with neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant radiation therapy has not shown any advantage in bladder cancer treatment.\nTrimodal therapy (alternative treatment).\nA combination of radiation and chemotherapy (chemoradiation) in conjunction with transurethral (endoscopic) bladder tumor resection can be used as an alternative in certain people. Review of available large data series on this so-called trimodality therapy has indicated similar long-term cancer specific survival rates, with improved overall quality of life as for people undergoing radical cystectomy with urinary reconstruction. However, currently no randomized control trials are available which has compared trimodal therapy with radical cystectomy. People who undergo trimodal therapy are usually highly selected and generally have T2 disease without hydronephrosis and/or carcinoma in-situ. Five year cancer specific survival and overall survival after trimodal therapy is between 50% to 82% and 36% to 74%.\nIn trimodal therapy, a maximal TURBT is conducted followed by chemoradiation therapy. Radiation sensitizing chemotherapy regimens consisting of cisplatin or 5-flurouracil and mitomycin C are used. Radiation therapy is via external bean radiotherapy (EBRT) with a target curative dose of 64-66 Gy. Surveillance for progression or recurrence should conducted with the aid of CT scans, cystoscopies and urine cytology. Side effects of chemoradiation include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, hair loss, mouth sores, diarrhea, constipation, increased risk of infections and bleeding and fatigue.\nIn people who fail trimodal therapy, radical cystectomy is considered if there is muscle invasive or recurrent tumors. Around 25-30% fail treatment and undergo salvage radical cystectomy. TURBT with intravesical therapy is indicated after treatment failure for non-muscle invasive disease.\nPartial cystectomy.\nIn people with solitary tumor without concurrent carcinoma in situ in an area where a clean surgical margins can be achieved, a partial cystectomy with lymphadenectomy can be considered. Management plan including partial cystectomy should be accompanied with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In people with urachal adenocarcinoma of the bladder, a partial cystectomy with \"en-bloc\" resection of urachal ligament and umbilicus can be considered.\nMetastatic disease.\nFirst line treatment.\nCisplatin-containing combination chemotherapy is the standard of care for metastatic bladder care. Fitness for receiving cisplatin based chemotherapy is assessed before treatment. A person is deemed unfit if anyone of the following is true.\nPeople who are deemed fit receive platinum based regimens; methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, with cisplatin (MVAC) or gemcitabine with cisplatin (GC). Alternative regimens include paclitaxel with gemcitabine and cisplatin (PCG, triple therapy) and cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastine (CMV). Response rate for cisplatin-based combination ranges from 39 to 65% and complete response is seen in 12-35% of the people. MVAC is better tolerated if it is combined with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and the regimen is known as dose dense MVAC regimen (DDMVAC). This combination has shown to decease all cause mortality. MVAC regimen is aggressive. Febrile neutropenia (fever due to decrease in white blood cells) occurs in 10 to 14% and death due to toxicity in about 3-4%. Common side effects of MVAC include suppression of bone marrow, fever due to decrease in white blood cells, sepsis, mucositis, and nausea and vomiting. In contrast, the GC regimen has shown lower rates of neutropenic sepsis and grade 3/4 mucositis compared to MVAC. Efforts have been made to increase tolerance of cisplatin-based regimen by replacing it with carboplatin-based chemotherapy. However, cisplatin-based therapy is superior to carboplatin-based chemotherapy in achieving overall and complete response. Nevertheless, nearly half of the people with metastatic disease are \"unfit\" for cisplatin-based therapy. In such persons a combination of carboplatin and gemcitabine (GemCarbo) can be used as first line chemotherapy. In people who are not eligible for any platinum based chemotherapy and have PD-L1 expression, Atezolizumab and Pembrolizumab can be used.\nPeople with bone metastasis should receive bisphosphonates or denosumab to prevent skeletal related events (e.g. fractures, spinal cord compression, bone pain).\nSecond line treatment.\nBladder cancer that is refractory or shows progression after platinum-based chemotherapy can be treated with second-line chemotherapy or immunotherapy.\nThe most commonly used second-line chemotherapy is single-agent regimes of Taxanes (Paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel and Docetaxel). Other single-agent regimes include Vinflunine, a third generation vinca alkaloid (approved in Europe), Gemcitabine, Pemetrexed, Oxaliplatin, and Ifosfamide. Side effects of Vinflunine include neutropenia, constipation, fatigue and anemia and has limited its use as a second line agent. Response to second-line chemotherapy occurs in 5%\u201320% people. Median progression free survival with second-line chemotherapy is 3\u20134 months.\nIn people with fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR) mutations and fail standard platinum based chemotherapy erdafitinib can be used. Erdafitinib has shown a response rate of 40% in these patients.\nFive immunotherapy agents has been approved in the US for use in metastatic bladder cancer. They act by inhibiting programmed cell-death protein 1 (PD-1) or programmed cell-death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Pembrolizumab and nivolumab, and are inhibitors of programmed cell-death ligand 1 (PD-1). Avelumab, atezolizumab and durvalumab are inhibitors of PD-L1.\nPembrolizumab probably improves overall survival a little and may slightly improve quality of life for people with urothelial cancer that has worsened after initial treatment when compared with continued chemotherapy. However, pembrolizumab may have only minimal effects on the rate of death resulting from treatment or the rate at which the cancer advances. Pembrolizumab may cause less serious side effects than chemotherapy.\nSurveillance and response.\nContrast enhanced CT is used to monitor lung, liver, and lymph node metastases. A bone scan is used to detect and monitor bone metastasis. Treatment response is measured using the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) into one of the following groups; response (complete or partial), stable disease and progressive disease.\nPrognosis.\nPeople with non-muscle invasive tumors have a favorable outcome (5-year survival is 95% vs. 69% of muscle invasive bladder cancer). However, 70% of them will have a recurrence after initial treatment with 30% of them presenting with muscle invasive disease. Recurrence and progression to a higher disease stage have a less favorable outcome.\nSurvival after radical cystectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection is dependent on the pathological stage. If the disease has not spread to the lymph node and is limited to the bladder (T1 or T2, N0) the 5-year survival is 78%. If it has spread locally around the region of the bladder with no lymph node involved (T3, N0) then the 5-year survival drops to 47%. In disease with lymph node spread (N+, irrespective of T stage) the 5-year survival is 31%. Locally advanced and metastatic disease drastically decreases survival, with a median survival of 3\u20136 months without chemotherapy. Cisplatin-based chemotherapy has increased the median survival to 15-months. However, the 5-year survival is still 15%.\nThere are several prognostic factors which determine cancer specific survival after radical cystectomy. Factor with detrimental effect of cancer specific survival are old age, higher tumor grade and pathological stage, lymph node metastasis, presence of lymphovascular invasion and positive soft tissue margin. Lymph node density (positive lymph nodes/total lymph nodes observed in the specimen from surgery) is a predictor of survival in lymph node positive disease. Higher the density lower is the survival.\nQuality of life.\nAfter radical cystectomy, urinary and sexual function remain inferior to the general population. People who have a neobladder have better emotional function and body image compared with ones with cutaneous diversion (who need to wear a bag to collect urine over their abdomen). Social factors such family, relationships, health and finances contribute significantly for determining good quality of life in people who have been diagnosed with bladder cancer.\nA high percentage of people with bladder cancer have anxiety and depression. People who are young, single and have advanced clinical disease have a high risk for getting diagnosed with a psychiatric illness post-treatment. People who suffer from psychiatric illness post treatment seem to have worse cancer specific and overall survival.\nEpidemiology.\nGlobally, in 2017, bladder cancer resulted in 196,000 deaths, a 5.4% (age adjusted) decrease from 2007. In 2018, the age adjusted rates of new cases of bladder cancer was 6 cases per 100,000 people and age adjusted death rate was 2 deaths per 100,000 people. Lebanon and Greece have the highest rate of new cases. In Lebanon, this high risk is attributed to high number of smokers and petrochemical air pollution.\nThe risk of bladder cancer occurrence is four times higher in men than in women. Smoking can only partially explain this higher rates in men in western hemisphere. One other reason is that the androgen receptor, which is much more active in men than in women, may play a part in the development of the cancer. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that men undergoing androgen suppression therapy for unrelated reason seem to have a lower risk of developing bladder cancer. In Africa, men are more prone to do field work and are exposed to infection with Schistosoma, this may explain to a certain extent the gap in incidence of squamous cell cancers in areas where bladder cancer is endemic. However, women present with more aggressive disease and have worse outcomes than men. This difference in outcomes is attributed to numerous factors such as, difference in carcinogen exposure, genetics, social and quality of care. One of the common signs of bladder cancer is hematuria and is quite often misdiagnosed as urinary tract infection in women, leading to a delay in diagnosis. Moreover, as mentioned earlier PSCA gene may play a role in aggressive tumors in women.\nCanada.\nBladder cancer is the sixth most common cancer accounting for 3.7% of the new cancer cases. in 2018, 30,700 Canadians were living with bladder cancer, 9160 new cases were diagnosed and 2467 died from it. In 2019, it is estimated that 11,800 new cases will be diagnosed and 2500 will die from it. Among the 11,800 new cases, 9100 will be in men and 2700 in women. Of the 2500 who would die from it, 1800 will be men and 700 will be women.\nChina.\nBladder cancer is the 14th most common cancer and 16th most common cause of cancer death. In, 2018 it accounted for 82,300 new cases and 38,200 deaths. The number of new cases is comparatively lower compared to its western counterparts. Majority of the people are diagnosed with non-muscle invasive disease (75%) and the rest have muscle invasive disease (25%). Carcinoma in situ was present in only 2.4% of the cases.\nEurope.\nIn 2015, 131,000 news cases were diagnosed in the European Union with 40,000 deaths. It is the 5th most common cancer and 9th most common cause of cancer deaths.. The 5-year relative survival for bladder cancers diagnosed between 2000 and 2007 is 69%. Geographic variation is seen in survival rates with 5-year survival rates of 75% in Northern to 65% in Eastern Europe.\nUnited Kingdom.\nBladder cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the UK accounting for 2.7% of all the new cancers cases. In 2018, there was 12,200 new cases and 6100 people died from it.\nUnited States.\nIn the United States in 2019 80,470 cases and 17,670 deaths are expected making it the sixth most common type of cancer in the region. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in men and the 12th most common cancer in women. Around 62,000 men and 19,000 women are diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2019. Between 2012 and 2016 annual rate of new bladder cancer cases decreased by one percent per year."}
{"title": "Colorectal_cancer", "label": "Disease", "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, colon cancer, or rectal cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and fatigue.\nMost colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors, with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red meat, processed meat, and alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous.\nBowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine whether the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening, by one of a number of methods, is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects.\nTreatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery, while cancer that has spread widely is usually not curable, with management being directed towards improving quality of life and symptoms. The five-year survival rate in the United States is around 65%. The individual likelihood of survival depends on how advanced the cancer is, whether or not all the cancer can be removed with surgery and the person's overall health. Globally, colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer, making up about 10% of all cases. In 2018, there were 1.09 million new cases and 551,000 deaths from the disease. It is more common in developed countries, where more than 65% of cases are found. It is less common in women than men.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe signs and symptoms of colorectal cancer depend on the location of the tumor in the bowel, and whether it has spread elsewhere in the body (metastasis). The classic warning signs include: worsening constipation, blood in the stool, decrease in stool caliber (thickness), loss of appetite, loss of weight, and nausea or vomiting in someone over 50 years old. Around 50% of individuals with colorectal cancer do not report any symptoms.\nRectal bleeding or anemia are high-risk symptoms in people over the age of 50. Weight loss and changes in a person's bowel habit are typically only concerning if they are associated with rectal bleeding.\nCause.\n75\u201395% of colorectal cancer cases occur in people with little or no genetic risk. Risk factors include older age, male sex, high intake of fat, sugar, alcohol, red meat, processed meats, obesity, smoking, and a lack of physical exercise. Approximately 10% of cases are linked to insufficient activity. The risk from alcohol appears to increase at greater than one drink per day. Drinking 5 glasses of water a day is linked to a decrease in the risk of colorectal cancer and adenomatous polyps. \"Streptococcus gallolyticus\" is associated with colorectal cancer. Some strains of \"Streptococcus bovis/Streptococcus equinus\" complex are consumed by millions of people daily and thus may be safe. 25 to 80% of people with \"Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus\" bacteremia have concomitant colorectal tumors. Seroprevalence of \"Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus\" is considered as a candidate practical marker for the early prediction of an underlying bowel lesion at high risk population. It has been suggested that the presence of antibodies to \"Streptococcus bovis/gallolyticus\" antigens or the antigens themselves in the bloodstream may act as markers for the carcinogenesis in the colon.\nPathogenic \"Escherichia coli\" may increase the risk of colorectal cancer by producing the genotoxic metabolite, colibactin.\nInflammatory bowel disease.\nPeople with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease) are at increased risk of colon cancer. The risk increases the longer a person has the disease, and the worse the severity of inflammation. In these high risk groups, both prevention with aspirin and regular colonoscopies are recommended. Endoscopic surveillance in this high-risk population may reduce the development of colorectal cancer through early diagnosis and may also reduce the chances of dying from colon cancer. People with inflammatory bowel disease account for less than 2% of colon cancer cases yearly. In those with Crohn's disease, 2% get colorectal cancer after 10\u00a0years, 8% after 20\u00a0years, and 18% after\u00a030 years. In people who have ulcerative colitis, approximately 16% develop either a cancer precursor or cancer of the colon over 30\u00a0years.\nGenetics.\nThose with a family history in two or more first-degree relatives (such as a parent or sibling) have a two to threefold greater risk of disease and this group accounts for about 20% of all cases. A number of genetic syndromes are also associated with higher rates of colorectal cancer. The most common of these is hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC or Lynch syndrome) which is present in about 3% of people with colorectal cancer. Other syndromes that are strongly associated with colorectal cancer include Gardner syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). For people with these syndromes, cancer almost always occurs and makes up 1% of the cancer cases. A total proctocolectomy may be recommended for people with FAP as a preventive measure due to the high risk of malignancy. Colectomy, removal of the colon, may not suffice as a preventive measure because of the high risk of rectal cancer if the rectum remains. The most common polyposis syndrome affecting the colon is serrated polyposis syndrome, which is associated with a 25-40% risk of CRC.\nMutations in the pair of genes (POLE and POLD1) have been associated with familial colon cancer.\nMost deaths due to colon cancer are associated with metastatic disease. A gene that appears to contribute to the potential for metastatic disease, metastasis associated in colon cancer 1 (\"MACC1\"), has been isolated. It is a transcriptional factor that influences the expression of hepatocyte growth factor. This gene is associated with the proliferation, invasion and scattering of colon cancer cells in cell culture, and tumor growth and metastasis in mice. MACC1 may be a potential target for cancer intervention, but this possibility needs to be confirmed with clinical studies.\nEpigenetic factors, such as abnormal DNA methylation of tumor suppressor promoters, play a role in the development of colorectal cancer.\nAshkenazi Jews have a 6% higher risk rate of getting adenomas and then colon cancer due to mutations in the APC gene being more common.\nPathogenesis.\nColorectal cancer is a disease originating from the epithelial cells lining the colon or rectum of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently as a result of mutations in the Wnt signaling pathway that increase signaling activity. The mutations can be inherited or acquired, and most probably occur in the intestinal crypt stem cell. The most commonly mutated gene in all colorectal cancer is the \"APC\" gene, which produces the APC protein. The APC protein prevents the accumulation of \u03b2-catenin protein. Without APC, \u03b2-catenin accumulates to high levels and translocates (moves) into the nucleus, binds to DNA, and activates the transcription of proto-oncogenes. These genes are normally important for stem cell renewal and differentiation, but when inappropriately expressed at high levels, they can cause cancer. While APC is mutated in most colon cancers, some cancers have increased \u03b2-catenin because of mutations in \u03b2-catenin (CTNNB1) that block its own breakdown, or have mutations in other genes with function similar to APC such as AXIN1, AXIN2, TCF7L2, or NKD1.\nBeyond the defects in the Wnt signaling pathway, other mutations must occur for the cell to become cancerous. The p53 protein, produced by the \"TP53\" gene, normally monitors cell division and induces their programmed death if they have Wnt pathway defects. Eventually, a cell line acquires a mutation in the \"TP53\" gene and transforms the tissue from a benign epithelial tumor into an invasive epithelial cell cancer. Sometimes the gene encoding p53 is not mutated, but another protective protein named BAX is mutated instead.\nOther proteins responsible for programmed cell death that are commonly deactivated in colorectal cancers are TGF-\u03b2 and DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer). TGF-\u03b2 has a deactivating mutation in at least half of colorectal cancers. Sometimes TGF-\u03b2 is not deactivated, but a downstream protein named SMAD is deactivated. DCC commonly has a deleted segment of a chromosome in colorectal cancer.\nApproximately 70% of all human genes are expressed in colorectal cancer, with just over 1% of having increased expression in colorectal cancer compared to other forms of cancer. Some genes are oncogenes: they are overexpressed in colorectal cancer. For example, genes encoding the proteins KRAS, RAF, and PI3K, which normally stimulate the cell to divide in response to growth factors, can acquire mutations that result in over-activation of cell proliferation. The chronological order of mutations is sometimes important. If a previous APC mutation occurred, a primary KRAS mutation often progresses to cancer rather than a self-limiting hyperplastic or borderline lesion. PTEN, a tumor suppressor, normally inhibits PI3K, but can sometimes become mutated and deactivated.\nComprehensive, genome-scale analysis has revealed that colorectal carcinomas can be categorized into hypermutated and non-hypermutated tumor types. In addition to the oncogenic and inactivating mutations described for the genes above, non-hypermutated samples also contain mutated CTNNB1, FAM123B, SOX9, ATM, and ARID1A. Progressing through a distinct set of genetic events, hypermutated tumors display mutated forms of ACVR2A, TGFBR2, MSH3, MSH6, SLC9A9, TCF7L2, and BRAF. The common theme among these genes, across both tumor types, is their involvement in Wnt and TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathways, which results in increased activity of MYC, a central player in colorectal cancer.\nMismatch repair (MMR) deficient tumours are characterized by a relatively high amount of poly-nucleotide tandem repeats. This is caused by a deficiency in MMR proteins \u2013 which are typically caused by epigenetic silencing and or inherited mutations (e.g. Lynch syndrome). 15 to 18 percent of colorectal cancer tumours have MMR deficiencies, with 3 percent developing due to Lynch syndrome. The role of the mismatch repair system is to protect the integrity of the genetic material within cells (i.e.: error detecting and correcting). Consequently, a deficiency in MMR proteins may lead to an inability to detect and repair genetic damage, allowing for further cancer-causing mutations to occur and colorectal cancer to progress.\nThe polyp to cancer progression sequence is the classical model of colorectal cancer pathogenesis. The polyp to cancer sequence describes the phases of transition from benign tumours into colorectal cancer over many years. Central to the polyp to CRC sequence are gene mutations, epigenetic alterations and local inflammatory changes. The polyp to CRC sequence can be used as an underlying framework to illustrate how specific molecular changes lead to various cancer subtypes.\nField defects.\nThe term \"field cancerization\" was first used in 1953 to describe an area or \"field\" of epithelium that has been preconditioned (by what were largely unknown processes at the time) to predispose it towards development of cancer. Since then, the terms \"field cancerization\", \"field carcinogenesis\", \"field defect\", and \"field effect\" have been used to describe pre-malignant or pre-neoplastic tissue in which new cancers are likely to arise.\nField defects are important in progression to colon cancer.\nHowever, as pointed out by Rubin, \"The vast majority of studies in cancer research has been done on well-defined tumors \"in vivo\", or on discrete neoplastic foci \"in vitro\". Yet there is evidence that more than 80% of the somatic mutations found in mutator phenotype human colorectal tumors occur before the onset of terminal clonal expansion.\" Similarly, Vogelstein et al. pointed out that more than half of somatic mutations identified in tumors occurred in a pre-neoplastic phase (in a field defect), during growth of apparently normal cells. Likewise, epigenetic alterations present in tumors may have occurred in pre-neoplastic field defects.\nAn expanded view of field effect has been termed \"etiologic field effect\", which encompasses not only molecular and pathologic changes in pre-neoplastic cells but also influences of exogenous environmental factors and molecular changes in the local microenvironment on neoplastic evolution from tumor initiation to death.\nEpigenetics.\nEpigenetic alterations are much more frequent in colon cancer than genetic (mutational) alterations. As described by Vogelstein et al., an average cancer of the colon has only 1 or 2 oncogene mutations and 1 to 5 tumor suppressor mutations (together designated \u201cdriver mutations\u201d), with about 60 further \u201cpassenger\u201d mutations. The oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are well studied and are described above under Pathogenesis.\nIn addition to epigenetic alteration of expression of miRNAs, other common types of epigenetic alterations in cancers that change gene expression levels include direct hypermethylation or hypomethylation of CpG islands of protein-encoding genes and alterations in histones and chromosomal architecture that influence gene expression. As an example, 147 hypermethylations and 27 hypomethylations of protein coding genes were frequently associated with colorectal cancers. Of the hypermethylated genes, 10 were hypermethylated in 100% of colon cancers, and many others were hypermethylated in more than 50% of colon cancers. In addition, 11 hypermethylations and 96 hypomethylations of miRNAs were also associated with colorectal cancers. Abnormal (aberrant) methylation occurs as a normal consequence of normal aging and the risk of colorectal cancer increases as a person gets older. The source and trigger of this age-related methylation is unknown. Approximately half of the genes that show age-related methylation changes are the same genes that have been identified to be involved in the development of colorectal cancer. These findings may suggest a reason for age being associated with the increased risk of developing colorectal cancer.\nEpigenetic reductions of DNA repair enzyme expression may likely lead to the genomic and epigenomic instability characteristic of cancer. As summarized in the articles Carcinogenesis and Neoplasm, for sporadic cancers in general, a deficiency in DNA repair is occasionally due to a mutation in a DNA repair gene, but is much more frequently due to epigenetic alterations that reduce or silence expression of DNA repair genes.\nEpigenetic alterations involved in the development of colorectal cancer may affect a person's response to chemotherapy.\nGenomics | Epigenomics.\nConsensus molecular subtypes (CMS) classification of colorectal cancer was first introduced in 2015. CMS classification so far has been considered the most robust classification system available for CRC that has a clear biological interpretability and the basis for future clinical stratification and subtype-based targeted interventions.\nA novel Epigenome-based Classification (EpiC) of colorectal cancer was proposed in 2021 introducing 4 enhancer subtypes in people with CRC. Chromatin states using 6 histone marks are characterized to identify EpiC subtypes. A combinatorial therapeutic approach based on the previously introduced consensus molecular subtypes (CMSs) and EpiCs could significantly enhance current treatment strategies.\nDiagnosis.\nColorectal cancer diagnosis is performed by sampling of areas of the colon suspicious for possible tumor development, typically during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, depending on the location of the lesion. It is confirmed by microscopical examination of a tissue sample.\nMedical imaging.\nA colorectal cancer is sometimes initially discovered on CT scan.\nPresence of metastases is determined by a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Other potential imaging tests such as PET and MRI may be used in certain cases. The latter is often used for rectal lesions to determine its local stage and to facilitate preoperative planning.\nHistopathology.\nThe histopathologic characteristics of the tumor are reported from the analysis of tissue taken from a biopsy or surgery. A pathology report contains a description of the microscopical characteristics of the tumor tissue, including both tumor cells and how the tumor invades into healthy tissues and finally if the tumor appears to be completely removed. The most common form of colon cancer is adenocarcinoma, constituting between 95% to 98% of all cases of colorectal cancer. Other, rarer types include lymphoma, adenosquamous and squamous cell carcinoma. Some subtypes have been found to be more aggressive. Immunohistochemistry may be used in uncertain cases.\nStaging.\nStaging of the cancer is based on both radiological and pathological findings. As with most other forms of cancer, tumor staging is based on the TNM system which considers how much the initial tumor has spread and the presence of metastases in lymph nodes and more distant organs. The AJCC 8th edition was published in 2018.\nPrevention.\nIt has been estimated that about half of colorectal cancer cases are due to lifestyle factors, and about a quarter of all cases are preventable. Increasing surveillance, engaging in physical activity, consuming a diet high in fiber, and reducing smoking and alcohol consumption decrease the risk.\nLifestyle.\nLifestyle risk factors with strong evidence include lack of exercise, cigarette smoking, alcohol, and obesity. The risk of colon cancer can be reduced by maintaining a normal body weight through a combination of sufficient exercise and eating a healthy diet.\nCurrent research consistently links eating more red meat and processed meat to a higher risk of the disease. Starting in the 1970s, dietary recommendations to prevent colorectal cancer often included increasing the consumption of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and reducing the intake of red meat and processed meats. This was based on animal studies and retrospective observational studies. However, large scale prospective studies have failed to demonstrate a significant protective effect, and due to the multiple causes of cancer and the complexity of studying correlations between diet and health, it is uncertain whether any specific dietary interventions (outside of eating a healthy diet) will have significant protective effects. In 2018 the National Cancer Institute stated that \"There is no reliable evidence that a diet started in adulthood that is low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables reduces the risk of CRC by a clinically important degree.\"\nAccording to the World Cancer Research Fund, consuming alcohol drinks and consuming processed meat both increase the risk of colorectal cancer \nWith regard to dietary fiber, the 2014 World Health Organization cancer report noted that it has been hypothesized that fiber might help prevent colorectal cancer, but most studies have not borne this out, and status of the science remained unclear as of 2014. A 2019 review, however, found evidence of benefit from dietary fiber and whole grains. The World Cancer Research Fund listed the benefit of fiber for prevention of colorectal cancer as \"probable\" as of 2017.\nHigher physical activity is recommended. Physical exercise is associated with a modest reduction in colon but not rectal cancer risk. High levels of physical activity reduce the risk of colon cancer by about 21%. Sitting regularly for prolonged periods is associated with higher mortality from colon cancer. The risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.\nMedication and supplements.\nAspirin and celecoxib appear to decrease the risk of colorectal cancer in those at high risk. Aspirin is recommended in those who are 50 to 60 years old, do not have an increased risk of bleeding, and are at risk for cardiovascular disease to prevent colorectal cancer. It is not recommended in those at average risk.\nThere is tentative evidence for calcium supplementation, but it is not sufficient to make a recommendation. Vitamin D intake and blood levels are associated with a lower risk of colon cancer.\nScreening.\nAs more than 80% of colorectal cancers arise from adenomatous polyps, screening for this cancer is effective for both early detection and for prevention. Diagnosis of cases of colorectal cancer through screening tends to occur 2\u20133 years before diagnosis of cases with symptoms. Any polyps that are detected can be removed, usually by colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy, and thus prevent them from turning into cancer. Screening has the potential to reduce colorectal cancer deaths by 60%.\nThe three main screening tests are colonoscopy, fecal occult blood testing, and flexible sigmoidoscopy. Of the three, only sigmoidoscopy cannot screen the right side of the colon where 42% of cancers are found. Flexible sigmoidoscopy, however, has the best evidence for decreasing the risk of death from any cause.\nFecal occult blood testing (FOBT) of the stool is typically recommended every two years and can be either guaiac-based or immunochemical. If abnormal FOBT results are found, participants are typically referred for a follow-up colonoscopy examination. When done once every 1\u20132 years, FOBT screening reduces colorectal cancer deaths by 16% and among those participating in screening, colorectal cancer deaths can be reduced up to 23%, although it has not been proven to reduce all-cause mortality. Immunochemical tests are accurate and do not require dietary or medication changes before testing.\nOther options include virtual colonoscopy and stool DNA screening testing (FIT-DNA). Virtual colonoscopy via a CT scan appears as good as standard colonoscopy for detecting cancers and large adenomas but is expensive, associated with radiation exposure, and cannot remove any detected abnormal growths as standard colonoscopy can. Stool DNA screening test looks for biomarkers associated with colorectal cancer and precancerous lesions, including altered DNA and blood hemoglobin. A positive result should be followed by colonoscopy. FIT-DNA has more false positives than FIT and thus results in more adverse effects. Further study is required as of 2016 to determine whether a three-year screening interval is correct.\nRecommendations.\nIn the United States, screening is typically recommended between ages 50 to 75\u00a0years. The American Cancer Society recommends starting at the age of 45. For those between 76 and 85 years old, the decision to screen should be individualized. For those at high risk, screenings usually begin at around 40.\nSeveral screening methods are recommended including stool-based tests every 2 years, sigmoidoscopy every 10 years with fecal immunochemical testing every two years, and colonoscopy every 10 years. It is unclear which of these two methods is better. Colonoscopy may find more cancers in the first part of the colon, but is associated with greater cost and more complications. For people with average risk who have had a high-quality colonoscopy with normal results, the American Gastroenterological Association does not recommend any type of screening in the 10 years following the colonoscopy. For people over 75 or those with a life expectancy of less than 10\u00a0years, screening is not recommended. It takes about 10 years after screening for one out of a 1000 people to benefit. The USPSTF list seven potential strategies for screening, with the most important thing being that at least one of these strategies is appropriately used.\nIn Canada, among those 50 to 75 years old at normal risk, fecal immunochemical testing or FOBT is recommended every two years or sigmoidoscopy every 10 years. Colonoscopy is less preferred.\nSome countries have national colorectal screening programs which offer FOBT screening for all adults within a certain age group, typically starting between ages 50 to 60. Examples of countries with organised screening include the United Kingdom, Australia, the Netherlands, Hong Kong and Taiwan.\nTreatment.\nThe treatment of colorectal cancer can be aimed at cure or palliation. The decision on which aim to adopt depends on various factors, including the person's health and preferences, as well as the stage of the tumor. Assessment in multidisciplinary teams is a critical part of determining whether the patient is suitable for surgery or not. When colorectal cancer is caught early, surgery can be curative. However, when it is detected at later stages (for which metastases are present), this is less likely and treatment is often directed at palliation, to relieve symptoms caused by the tumour and keep the person as comfortable as possible.\nSurgery.\nIf the cancer is found at an early stage, it may be removed during a colonoscopy using one of several techniques, including endoscopic mucosal resection or endoscopic submucosal dissection. For people with localized cancer, the preferred treatment is complete surgical removal with adequate margins, with the attempt of achieving a cure. The procedure of choice is a partial colectomy (or proctocolectomy for rectal lesions) where the affected part of the colon or rectum is removed along with parts of its mesocolon and blood supply to facilitate removal of draining lymph nodes. This can be done either by an open laparotomy or laparoscopically, depending on factors related to the individual person and lesion factors. The colon may then be reconnected or a person may have a colostomy.\nIf there are only a few metastases in the liver or lungs, these may also be removed. Chemotherapy may be used before surgery to shrink the cancer before attempting to remove it. The two most common sites of recurrence of colorectal cancer are the liver and lungs. For peritoneal carcinomatosis cytoreductive surgery, sometimes in combination with HIPEC can be used in an attempt to remove the cancer.\nChemotherapy.\nIn both cancer of the colon and rectum, chemotherapy may be used in addition to surgery in certain cases. The decision to add chemotherapy in management of colon and rectal cancer depends on the stage of the disease.\nIn Stage I colon cancer, no chemotherapy is offered, and surgery is the definitive treatment. The role of chemotherapy in Stage II colon cancer is debatable, and is usually not offered unless risk factors such as T4 tumor, undifferentiated tumor, vascular and perineural invasion or inadequate lymph node sampling is identified. It is also known that the people who carry abnormalities of the mismatch repair genes do not benefit from chemotherapy. For stage III and Stage IV colon cancer, chemotherapy is an integral part of treatment.\nIf cancer has spread to the lymph nodes or distant organs, which is the case with stage III and stage IV colon cancer respectively, adding chemotherapy agents fluorouracil, capecitabine or oxaliplatin increases life expectancy. If the lymph nodes do not contain cancer, the benefits of chemotherapy are controversial. If the cancer is widely metastatic or unresectable, treatment is then palliative. Typically in this setting, a number of different chemotherapy medications may be used. Chemotherapy drugs for this condition may include capecitabine, fluorouracil, irinotecan, oxaliplatin and UFT. The drugs capecitabine and fluorouracil are interchangeable, with capecitabine being an oral medication and fluorouracil being an intravenous medicine. Some specific regimens used for CRC are CAPOX, FOLFOX, FOLFOXIRI, and FOLFIRI. Antiangiogenic drugs such as bevacizumab are often added in first line therapy. Another class of drugs used in the second line setting are epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, of which the three FDA approved ones are aflibercept, cetuximab and panitumumab.\nThe primary difference in the approach to low stage rectal cancer is the incorporation of radiation therapy. Often, it is used in conjunction with chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant fashion to enable surgical resection, so that ultimately a colostomy is not required. However, it may not be possible in low lying tumors, in which case, a permanent colostomy may be required. Stage IV rectal cancer is treated similar to stage IV colon cancer.\nStage IV colorectal cancer due to peritoneal carcinomatosis can be treated using HIPEC combined with cytoreductive surgery, in some people.\nRadiation therapy.\nWhile a combination of radiation and chemotherapy may be useful for rectal cancer, for some people requiring treatment, chemoradiotherapy can increase acute treatment-related toxicity, and has not been shown to improve survival rates compared to radiotherapy alone, although it is associated with less local recurrence. The use of radiotherapy in colon cancer is not routine due to the sensitivity of the bowels to radiation. As with chemotherapy, radiotherapy can be used as a neoadjuvant for clinical stages T3 and T4 for rectal cancer. This results in downsizing or downstaging of the tumour, preparing it for surgical resection, and also decreases local recurrence rates. For locally advanced rectal cancer, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has become the standard treatment. Additionally, when surgery is not possible radiation therapy has been suggested to be an effective treatment against CRC pulmonary metastases, which are developed by 10-15% of people with CRC.\nImmunotherapy.\nImmunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors has been found to be useful for a type of colorectal cancer with mismatch repair deficiency and microsatellite instability. Pembrolizumab is approved for advanced CRC tumours that are MMR deficient and have failed usual treatments. Most people who do improve, however, still worsen after months or years. Other types of colorectal cancer as of 2017 is still being studied.\nPalliative care.\nPalliative care is recommended for any person who has advanced colon cancer or who has significant symptoms.\nInvolvement of palliative care may be beneficial to improve the quality of life for both the person and his or her family, by improving symptoms, anxiety and preventing admissions to the hospital.\nIn people with incurable colorectal cancer, palliative care can consist of procedures that relieve symptoms or complications from the cancer but do not attempt to cure the underlying cancer, thereby improving quality of life. Surgical options may include non-curative surgical removal of some of the cancer tissue, bypassing part of the intestines, or stent placement. These procedures can be considered to improve symptoms and reduce complications such as bleeding from the tumor, abdominal pain and intestinal obstruction. Non-operative methods of symptomatic treatment include radiation therapy to decrease tumor size as well as pain medications.\nFollow-up.\nThe U.S. National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Society of Clinical Oncology provide guidelines for the follow-up of colon cancer. A medical history and physical examination are recommended every 3 to 6 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 5 years. Carcinoembryonic antigen blood level measurements follow the same timing, but are only advised for people with T2 or greater lesions who are candidates for intervention. A CT-scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can be considered annually for the first 3 years for people who are at high risk of recurrence (for example, those who had poorly differentiated tumors or venous or lymphatic invasion) and are candidates for curative surgery (with the aim to cure). A colonoscopy can be done after 1 year, except if it could not be done during the initial staging because of an obstructing mass, in which case it should be performed after 3 to 6 months. If a villous polyp, a polyp &gt;1 centimeter or high-grade dysplasia is found, it can be repeated after 3 years, then every 5 years. For other abnormalities, the colonoscopy can be repeated after 1 year.\nRoutine PET or ultrasound scanning, chest X-rays, complete blood count or liver function tests are not recommended.\nFor people who have undergone curative surgery or adjuvant therapy (or both) to treat non-metastatic colorectal cancer, intense surveillance and close follow-up have not been shown to provide additional survival benefits.\nExercise.\nExercise may be recommended in the future as secondary therapy to cancer survivors. In epidemiological studies, exercise may decrease colorectal cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality. Results for the specific amounts of exercise needed to observe a benefit were conflicting. These differences may reflect differences in tumour biology and the expression of biomarkers. People with tumors that lacked CTNNB1 expression (\u03b2-catenin), involved in Wnt signalling pathway, required more than 18 Metabolic equivalent (MET) hours per week, a measure of exercise, to observe a reduction in colorectal cancer mortality. The mechanism of how exercise benefits survival may be involved in immune surveillance and inflammation pathways. In clinical studies, a pro-inflammatory response was found in people with stage II-III colorectal cancer who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after completing their primary therapy. Oxidative balance may be another possible mechanism for benefits observed. A significant decrease in 8-oxo-dG was found in the urine of people who underwent 2 weeks of moderate exercise after primary therapy. Other possible mechanisms may involve metabolic hormone and sex-steroid hormones, although these pathways may be involved in other types of cancers\nAnother potential biomarker may be p27. Survivors with tumors that expressed p27 and performed greater and equal to 18 MET hours per week were found to have reduced colorectal cancer mortality survival compared to those with less than 18 MET hours per week. Survivors without p27 expression who exercised were shown to have worse outcomes. The constitutive activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway may explain the loss of p27 and excess energy balance may up-regulate p27 to stop cancer cells from dividing.\nPhysical activity provides benefits to people with non-advanced colorectal cancer. Improvements in aerobic fitness, cancer-related fatigue and health-related quality of life have been reported in the short term. However, these improvements were not observed at the level of disease-related mental health, such as anxiety and depression.\nPrognosis.\nFewer than 600 genes are linked to outcomes in colorectal cancer. These include both unfavorable genes, where high expression is related to poor outcome, for example the heat shock 70 kDa protein 1 (HSPA1A), and favorable genes where high expression is associated with better survival, for example the putative RNA-binding protein 3 (RBM3).\nRecurrence rates.\nThe average five-year recurrence rate in people where surgery is successful is 5% for stage I cancers, 12% in stage II and 33% in stage III. However, depending on the number of risk factors it ranges from 9\u201322% in stage II and 17\u201344% in stage III.\nSurvival rates.\nIn Europe the five-year survival rate for colorectal cancer is less than 60%. In the developed world about a third of people who get the disease die from it.\nSurvival is directly related to detection and the type of cancer involved, but overall is poor for symptomatic cancers, as they are typically quite advanced. Survival rates for early stage detection are about five times that of late stage cancers. People with a tumor that has not breached the muscularis mucosa (TNM stage Tis, N0, M0) have a five-year survival rate of 100%, while those with invasive cancer of T1 (within the submucosal layer) or T2 (within the muscular layer) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 90%. Those with a more invasive tumor yet without node involvement (T3-4, N0, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 70%. People with positive regional lymph nodes (any T, N1-3, M0) have an average five-year survival rate of approximately 40%, while those with distant metastases (any T, any N, M1) have a poor prognosis and the five year survival ranges from &lt;5 percent to 31 percent. The prognosis depends on a multitude of factors which include the physical fitness level of the person, extent of metastases, and tumor grade.\nWhilst the impact of colorectal cancer on those who survive varies greatly there will often be a need to adapt to both physical and psychological outcomes of the illness and its treatment. For example, it is common for people to experience incontinence, sexual dysfunction, problems with stoma care and fear of cancer recurrence after primary treatment has concluded.\nA qualitative systematic review published in 2021 highlighted that there are three main factors influencing adaptation to living with and beyond colorectal cancer: support mechanisms, severity of late effects of treatment and psychosocial adjustment. Therefore it is essential that people are offered appropriate support to help them better adapt to life following treatment.\nEpidemiology.\nGlobally more than 1\u00a0million people get colorectal cancer every year resulting in about 715,000 deaths as of 2010 up from 490,000 in 1990.\n, it is the second most common cause of cancer in women (9.2% of diagnoses) and the third most common in men (10.0%) with it being the fourth most common cause of cancer death after lung, stomach, and liver cancer. It is more common in developed than developing countries. Globally incidences vary 10-fold with highest rates in Australia, New Zealand, Europe and the US and lowest rates in Africa and South-Central Asia.\nUnited States.\nColorectal cancer is the second highest cause of cancer occurrence and death for men and women in the United States combined. An estimated 141,210 cases were diagnosed in 2011.\nBased on rates from 2007 to 2009, 5.0% of US men and women born today will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer during their lifetime. From 2005 to 2009, the median age at diagnosis for cancer of the colon and rectum in the US was 69 years of age. Approximately 0.1% were diagnosed under age 20; 1.1% between 20 and 34; 4.0% between 35 and 44; 13.4% between 45 and 54; 20.4% between 55 and 64; 24.0% between 65 and 74; 25.0% between 75 and 84; and 12.0% 85+ years of age. Rates are higher among males (54 per 100,000 c.f. 40 per 100,000 for females).\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK about 41,000 people a year get colon cancer making it the fourth most common type.\nAustralia.\nOne in 19 men and one in 28 women in Australia will develop colorectal cancer before the age of 75; one in 10 men and one in 15 women will develop it by 85 years of age.\nPapua New Guinea.\nIn the developing countries like Papua New Guinea and other Pacific Island States including the Solomon Islands, colorectal cancer is a very rare cancer amongst the people, which is least common compared to lung, stomach, liver or breast cancer. It is estimated that at least 8 in 100,000 of the people are most likely to developed colorectal cancer every year, which is unlike lung or breast cancer, where for the latter alone is 24 in 100,000 of the women folks alone. \nHistory.\nRectal cancer has been diagnosed in an Ancient Egyptian mummy who had lived in the Dakhleh Oasis during the Ptolemaic period.\nSociety and culture.\nIn the United States, March is colorectal cancer awareness month.\nResearch.\nPreliminary in-vitro evidence suggests lactic acid bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli, streptococci or lactococci) may be protective against the development and progression of colorectal cancer through several mechanisms such as antioxidant activity, immunomodulation, promoting programmed cell death, antiproliferative effects, and epigenetic modification of cancer cells.\nMouse models of colorectal and intestinal cancer have been developed and are used in research."}
{"title": "Failed_back_syndrome", "label": "Disease", "text": "Failed back syndrome or post-laminectomy syndrome is a condition characterized by chronic pain following back surgeries. Many factors can contribute to the onset or development of FBS, including residual or recurrent spinal disc herniation, persistent post-operative pressure on a spinal nerve, altered joint mobility, joint hypermobility with instability, scar tissue (fibrosis), depression, anxiety, sleeplessness, spinal muscular deconditioning and even \"Cutibacterium acnes\" infection. An individual may be predisposed to the development of FBS due to systemic disorders such as diabetes, autoimmune disease and peripheral blood vessels (vascular) disease. \nCommon symptoms associated with FBS include diffuse, dull and aching pain involving the back or legs. Abnormal sensibility may include sharp, pricking, and stabbing pain in the extremities. The term \"post-laminectomy syndrome\" is used by some doctors to indicate the same condition as failed back syndrome.\nThe treatments of post-laminectomy syndrome include physical therapy, microcurrent electrical neuromuscular stimulator, minor nerve blocks, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), behavioral medicine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) medications, membrane stabilizers, antidepressants, spinal cord stimulation, and intrathecal morphine pump. Use of epidural steroid injections may be minimally helpful in some cases. The targeted anatomic use of a potent anti-inflammatory anti-TNF therapeutics is being investigated.\nThe number of spinal surgeries varies around the world. The United States and the Netherlands report the highest number of spinal surgeries, while the United Kingdom and Sweden report the fewest. Recently, there have been calls for more aggressive surgical treatment in Europe. Success rates of spinal surgery vary for many reasons.\nCause.\nPatients who have undergone one or more operations on the lumbar spine and continue to experience pain afterward can be divided into two groups. The first group comprise those in whom surgery was not actually indicated or the surgery performed was not likely to achieve the desired result, and those in whom surgery was indicated but which technically did not achieve the intended result. Patients whose pain complaints are of a radicular nature have a better chance for a good outcome than those whose pain complaints are limited to pain in the back.\nThe second group includes patients who had incomplete or inadequate operations. Lumbar spinal stenosis may be overlooked, especially when it is associated with disc protrusion or herniation. Removal of a disc, while not addressing the underlying presence of stenosis, can lead to disappointing results. Occasionally operating on the wrong level occurs, as does failure to recognize an extruded or sequestered disc fragment. Inadequate or inappropriate surgical exposure can lead to other problems in not getting to the underlying pathology. Hakelius reported a 3% incidence of serious nerve root damage.\nIn 1992, Turner \"et al.\" published a survey of 74 journal articles which reported the results after decompression for spinal stenosis. Good to excellent results were on average reported by 64% of the patients. There was, however, a wide variation in outcomes reported. There was a better result in patients who had a degenerative spondylolisthesis. A similarly designed study by Mardjekto et al. found that a concomitant spinal arthrodesis (fusion) had a greater success rate. Herron and Trippi evaluated 24 patients, all with degenerative spondylolisthesis treated with laminectomy alone. At follow-up varying between 18 and 71 months after surgery, 20 out of the 24 patients reported a good result. Epstein reported on 290 patients treated over a 25-year period. Excellent results were obtained in 69% and good results in 13%. These optimistic reports do not correlate with \"return to competitive employment\" rates, which for the most part are dismal in most spinal surgery series.\nIn the past two decades there has been a dramatic increase in fusion surgery in the U.S.: in 2001 over 122,000 lumbar fusions were performed, a 22% increase from 1990 in fusions per 100,000 population, increasing to an estimate of 250,000 in 2003, and 500,000 in 2006. In 2003, the national bill for the hardware for fusion alone was estimated to have soared to $2.5 billion a year.\nFor patients with continued pain after surgery which is not due to the above complications or conditions, interventional pain physicians speak of the need to identify the \"pain generator\" i.e. the anatomical structure responsible for the patient's pain. To be effective, the surgeon must operate on the correct anatomic structure, but is often not possible to determine the source of the pain. The reason for this is that many patients with chronic pain often have disc bulges at multiple spinal levels and the physical examination and imaging studies are unable to pinpoint the source of pain. In addition, spinal fusion itself, particularly if more than one spinal level is operated on, may result in \"adjacent segment degeneration\". This is thought to occur because the fused segments may result in increased torsional and stress forces being transmitted to the intervertebral discs located above and below the fused vertebrae. This pathology is one reason behind the development of artificial discs as a possible alternative to fusion surgery. But fusion surgeons argue that spinal fusion is more time-tested, and artificial discs contain metal hardware that is unlikely to last as long as biological material without shattering and leaving metal fragments in the spinal canal. These represent different schools of thought. (See discussion on disc replacement infra.)\nAnother highly relevant consideration is the increasing recognition of the importance of \"chemical radiculitis\" in the generation of back pain. A primary focus of surgery is to remove \"pressure\" or reduce mechanical compression on a neural element: either the spinal cord, or a nerve root. But it is increasingly recognized that back pain, rather than being solely due to compression, may instead entirely be due to chemical inflammation of the nerve root. It has been known for several decades that disc herniations result in a massive inflammation of the associated nerve root. In the past five years increasing evidence has pointed to a specific inflammatory mediator of this pain. This inflammatory molecule, called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), is released not only by the herniated or protruding disc, but also in cases of disc tear (annular tear), by facet joints, and in spinal stenosis. In addition to causing pain and inflammation, TNF may also contribute to disc degeneration. If the cause of the pain is not compression, but rather is inflammation mediated by TNF, then this may well explain why surgery might not relieve the pain, and might even exacerbate it, resulting in FBSS.\nRole of sacroiliac joint (SIJ) in lower back pain (LBP).\nA 2005 review by Cohen concluded,'The SI joint is a real yet underappreciated pain generator in an estimated 15% to 25% of patients with axial LBP'. Studies by Ha, et al., show that the incidence of SI joint degeneration in post-lumbar fusion surgery is 75% at 5 years post-surgery, based on imaging. Studies by DePalma and Liliang, et al., demonstrate that 40\u201361% of post-lumbar fusion patients were symptomatic for SI joint dysfunction based on diagnostic blocks.\nSmoking.\nRecent studies have shown that cigarette smokers will routinely fail all spinal surgery, if the goal of that surgery is the decrease of pain and impairment. Many surgeons consider smoking to be an absolute contraindication to spinal surgery. Nicotine appears to interfere with bone metabolism through induced calcitonin resistance and decreased osteoblastic function. It may also restrict small blood vessel diameter leading to increased scar formation.\nThere is an association between cigarette smoking, back pain and chronic pain syndromes of all types.\nIn a report of 426 spinal surgery patients in Denmark, smoking was shown to have a negative effect on fusion and overall patient satisfaction, but no measurable influence on the functional outcome.\nThere is a validation of the hypothetical assumption that postoperative smoking cessation helps to reverse the impact of cigarette smoking on outcome after spinal fusion. If patients cease cigarette smoking in the immediate post operative period, there is a positive impact on success.\nRegular smoking in adolescence was associated with low back pain in young adults. Pack-years of smoking showed an exposure-response relationship among girls.\nA recent study suggested that cigarette smoking adversely affects serum hydrocodone levels. Prescribing physicians should be aware that in some cigarette smokers, serum hydrocodone levels might not be detectable.\nIn a study from Denmark reviewing many reports in the literature, it was concluded that smoking should be considered a weak risk indicator and not a cause of low back pain. In a multitude of epidemiologic studies, an association between smoking and low back pain has been reported, but variations in approach and study results make this literature difficult to reconcile. \nIn a massive study of 3482 patients undergoing lumbar spine surgery from the National Spine Network, comorbidities of (1) smoking, (2) compensation, (3) self reported poor overall health and (4) pre-existing psychological factors were predictive in a high risk of failure. Followup was carried out at 3 months and one year after surgery. Pre-operative depressive disorders tended not to do well.\nSmoking has been shown to increase the incidence of post operative infection as well as decrease fusion rates. One study showed 90% of post operative infections occurred in smokers, as well as myonecrosis (muscle destruction) around the wound.\nPathology.\nBefore the advent of CT scanning, the pathology in failed back syndrome was difficult to understand. Computerized tomography in conjunction with metrizamide myelography in the late 1960s and 1970s allowed direct observation of the mechanisms involved in post operative failures. Six distinct pathologic conditions were identified:\nRecurrent or persistent disc herniation.\nRemoval of a disc at one level can lead to disc herniation at a different level at a later time. Even the most complete surgical excision of the disc still leaves 30\u201340% of the disc, which cannot be safely removed. This retained disc can re-herniate sometime after surgery. Virtually every major structure in the abdomen and the posterior retroperitoneal space has been injured, at some point, by removing discs using posterior laminectomy/discectomy surgical procedures. The most prominent of these is a laceration of the left internal iliac vein, which lies in close proximity to the anterior portion of the disc. In some studies, recurrent pain in the same radicular pattern or a different pattern can be as high as 50% after disc surgery. Many observers have noted that the most common cause of a failed back syndrome is caused from recurrent disc herniation at the same level originally operated. A rapid removal in a second surgery can be curative. The clinical picture of a recurrent disc herniation usually involves a significant pain-free interval. However, physical findings may be lacking, and a good history is necessary. The time period for the emergence of new symptoms can be short or long. Diagnostic signs such as the straight leg raise test may be negative even if real pathology is present. The presence of a positive myelogram may represent a new disc herniation, but can also be indicative of a post operative scarring situation simply mimicking a new disc. Newer MRI imaging techniques have clarified this dilemma somewhat. Conversely, a recurrent disc can be difficult to detect in the presence of post op scarring. Myelography is inadequate to completely evaluate the patient for recurrent disc disease, and CT or MRI scanning is necessary. Measurement of tissue density can be helpful.\nEven though the complications of laminectomy for disc herniation can be significant, a recent series of studies involving thousands of patients published under auspices of Dartmouth Medical School concluded at four-year follow-up that those who underwent surgery for a lumbar disc herniation achieved greater improvement than nonoperatively treated patients in all primary and secondary outcomes except work status.\nSpinal stenosis.\nSpinal stenosis can be a late complication after laminectomy for disc herniation or when surgery was performed for the primary pathologic condition of spinal stenosis. \nIn the Maine Study, among patients with lumbar spinal stenosis completing 8- to 10-year follow-up, low back pain relief, predominant symptom improvement, and satisfaction with the current state were similar in patients initially treated surgically or nonsurgically. However, leg pain relief and greater back-related functional status continued to favor those initially receiving surgical treatment.\nA large study of spinal stenosis from Finland found the prognostic factors for ability to work after surgery were ability to work before surgery, age under 50 years, and no prior back surgery. The very long-term outcome (mean follow-up time of 12.4 years) was excellent-to-good in 68% of patients (59% women and 73% men). Furthermore, in the longitudinal follow-up, the result improved between 1985 and 1991. No special complications were manifested during this very long-term follow-up time. The patients with total or subtotal block in preoperative myelography achieved the best result. Furthermore, patients with block stenosis improved their result significantly in the longitudinal follow-up. The postoperative stenosis seen in computed tomography (CT) scans was observed in 65% of 90 patients, and it was severe in 23 patients (25%). However, this successful or unsuccessful surgical decompression did not correlate with patients' subjective disability, walking capacity or severity of pain. Previous back surgery had a strong worsening effect on surgical results. This effect was very clear in patients with total block in the preoperative myelography. The surgical result of a patient with previous back surgery was similar to that of a patient without previous back surgery when the time interval between the last two operations was more than 18 months.\nPost-operative MRI findings of stenosis are probably of limited value compared to symptoms experienced by patients. Patients' perception of improvement had a much stronger correlation with long-term surgical outcome than structural findings seen on postoperation magnetic resonance imaging. Degenerative findings had a greater effect on patients' walking capacity than stenotic findings.\nPostoperative radiologic stenosis was very common in patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis, but this did not correlate with clinical outcome. The clinician must be cautious when reconciling clinical symptoms and signs with postoperative computed tomography findings in patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis.\nA study from Georgetown University reported on one-hundred patients who had undergone decompressive surgery for lumbar stenosis between 1980 and 1985. Four patients with postfusion stenosis were included. A 5-year follow-up period was achieved in 88 patients. The mean age was 67 years, and 80% were over 60 years of age. There was a high incidence of coexisting medical diseases, but the principal disability was lumbar stenosis with neurological involvement. Initially there was a high incidence of success, but recurrence of neurological involvement and persistence of low-back pain led to an increasing number of failures. By 5 years this number had reached 27% of the available population pool, suggesting that the failure rate could reach 50% within the projected life expectancies of most patients. Of the 26 failures, 16 were secondary to renewed neurological involvement, which occurred at new levels of stenosis in eight and recurrence of stenosis at operative levels in eight. Reoperation was successful in 12 of these 16 patients, but two required a third operation. The incidence of spondylolisthesis at 5 years was higher in the surgical failures (12 of 26 patients) than in the surgical successes (16 of 64). Spondylolisthetic stenosis tended to recur within a few years following decompression. Because of age and associated illnesses, fusion may be difficult to achieve in this group.\nPost operative infection.\nA small minority of lumbar surgical patients will develop a post operative infection. In most cases, this is a bad complication and does not bode well for eventual improvement or future employability. Reports from the surgical literature indicate an infection rate anywhere from 0% to almost 12%. The incidence of infection tends to increase as the complexity of the procedure and operating time increase. Usage of metal implants (instrumentation) tends to increase the risk of infection. Factors associated with an increased infection include diabetes mellitus, obesity, malnutrition, smoking, previous infection, rheumatoid arthritis, and immunodeficiency.\nPrevious wound infection should be considered as a contraindication to any further spinal surgery, since the likelihood of improving such patients with more surgery is small.\nAntimicrobial prophylaxis (giving antibiotics during or after surgery before an infection begins) reduces the rate of surgical site infection in lumbar spine surgery, but a great deal of variation exists regarding its use. In a Japanese study, utilizing the Centers for Disease Control recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis, an overall rate of 0.7% infection was noted, with a single dose antibiotic group having 0.4% infection rate and multiple dosage antibiotic infection rate of 0.8%. The authors had previously used prophylactic antibiotics for 5 to 7 postoperative days. Based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guideline, their antibiotic prophylaxis was changed to the day of surgery only. It was concluded there was no statistical difference in the rate of infection between the two different antibiotic protocols. Based on the CDC guideline, a single dose of prophylactic antibiotic was proven to be efficacious for the prevention of infection in lumbar spine surgeries.\nEpidural post-operative fibrosis.\nEpidural scarring following a laminectomy for disc excision is a common feature when re-operating for recurrent sciatica or radiculopathy. When the scarring is associated with a disc herniation and/or recurrent spinal stenosis, it is relatively common, occurring in more than 60% of cases. For a time, it was theorized that placing a fat graft over the dural could prevent post operative scarring. However, initial enthusiasm has waned in recent years. In an extensive laminectomy involving 2 or more vertebra, post operative scarring is the norm. It is most often seen around the L5 and S1 nerve roots.\nAdhesive arachnoiditis.\nFibrous scarring can also be a complication within the subarachnoid space. It is notoriously difficult to detect and evaluate. Prior to the development of magnetic resonance imaging, the only way to ascertain the presence of arachnoiditis was by opening the dura. In the days of CT scanning and Pantopaque and later, Metrizamide myelography, the presence of arachnoiditis could be speculated based on radiographic findings. Often, myelography prior to the introduction of Metrizamide was the cause of arachnoiditis. It can also be caused by the long term pressure brought about with either a severe disc herniation or spinal stenosis. The presence of both epidural scarring and arachnoiditis in the same patient are probably quite common. \nArachnoiditis is a broad term denoting inflammation of the meninges and subarachnoid space. A variety of causes exist, including infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic processes.\nInfectious causes include bacterial, viral, fungal, and parasitic agents. Noninfectious inflammatory processes include surgery, intrathecal hemorrhage, and the administration of intrathecal (inside the dural canal) agents such as myelographic contrast media, anesthetics (e.g. chloroprocaine), and steroids (e.g. Depo-Medrol, Kenalog). Lately iatrogenic arachnoiditis has been attributed to misplaced Epidural Steroid Injection therapy when accidentally administered intrathecally. The preservatives and suspension agents found in all steroid injectates, which aren't indicated for epidural administration by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration due to reports of severe adverse events including arachnoiditis, paralysis and death, have now been directly linked to the onset of the disease following the initial stage of chemical meningitis. \nNeoplasia includes the hematogenous spread of systemic tumors, such as breast and lung carcinoma, melanoma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Neoplasia also includes direct seeding of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors such as glioblastoma multiforme, medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and choroid plexus carcinoma. Strictly speaking, the most common cause of arachnoiditis in failed back syndrome is not infectious or from cancer. It is due to non-specific scarring secondary to the surgery or the underlying pathology. \nNerve injury.\nLaceration of a nerve root, or damage from cautery or traction can lead to chronic pain, however this can be difficult to determine. Chronic compression of the nerve root by a persistent agent such as disc, bone (osteophyte) or scarring can also permanently damage the nerve root. Epidural scarring caused by the initial pathology or occurring after the surgery can also contribute to nerve damage. In one study of failed back patients, the presence of pathology was noted to be at the same site as the level of surgery performed in 57% of cases. The remaining cases developed pathology at a different level, or on the opposite side, but at the same level as the surgery was performed. In theory, all failed back patients have some sort of nerve injury or damage which leads to a persistence of symptoms after a reasonable healing time.\nAvoiding post-laminectomy/laminotomy syndrome.\nSmaller procedures that do not remove bone (such as Endoscopic Transforaminal Lumbar Discectomy and Reconfiguration) do not cause post laminectomy/laminotomy syndrome.\nManagement.\nFailed back syndrome (FBS) is a well-recognized complication of surgery of the lumbar spine. It can result in chronic pain and disability, often with disastrous emotional and financial consequences to the patient. Many patients have traditionally been classified as \"spinal cripples\" and are consigned to a life of long-term narcotic treatment with little chance of recovery. Despite extensive work in recent years, FBS remains a challenging and costly disorder.\nOpioids.\nA study of chronic pain patients from the University of Wisconsin found that methadone is most widely known for its use in the treatment of opioid dependence, but methadone also provides effective analgesia. Patients who experience inadequate pain relief or intolerable side effects with other opioids or who suffer from neuropathic pain may benefit from a transition to methadone as their analgesic agent. Adverse effects, particularly respiratory depression and death, make a fundamental knowledge of methadone's pharmacological properties essential to the provider considering methadone as analgesic therapy for a patient with chronic pain.\nPatient selection.\nPatients who have sciatic pain (pain in the back, radiating down the buttock to the leg) and clear clinical findings of an identifiable radicular nerve loss caused by a herniated disc will have a better post operative course than those who simply have low back pain. If a specific disc herniation causing pressure on a nerve root cannot be identified, the results of surgery are likely to be disappointing. Patients involved in worker's compensation, tort litigation or other compensation systems tend to fare more poorly after surgery. Surgery for spinal stenosis usually has a good outcome, if the surgery is done in an extensive manner, and done within the first year or so of the appearance of symptoms.\nOaklander and North define the Failed Back Syndrome as a chronic pain patient after one or more surgical procedure to the spine. They delineated these characteristics of the relation between the patient and the surgeon: \nIn the absence of a financial source for disability or worker's compensation, other psychological features may limit the ability of the patient to recover from surgery. Some patients are simply unfortunate, and fall into the category of \"chronic pain\" despite their desire to recover and the best efforts of the physicians involved in their care. Even less invasive forms of surgery are not uniformly successful; approximately 30,000\u201340,000 laminectomy patients obtain either no relief of symptomatology or a recurrence of symptoms. Another less invasive form of spinal surgery, percutaneous disc surgery, has reported revision rates as high as 65%. It is no surprise, therefore, that FBSS is a significant medical concern which merits further research and attention by the medical and surgical communities.\nTotal disc replacement.\nLumbar total disc replacement was originally designed to be an alternative to lumbar arthrodesis (fusion). The procedure was met with great excitement and heightened expectations both in the United States and Europe. In late 2004, the first lumbar total disc replacement received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). More experience existed in Europe. Since then, the initial excitement has given way to skepticism and concern. Various failure rates and strategies for revision of total disc replacement have been reported.\nThe role of artificial or total disc replacement in the treatment of spinal disorders remains ill-defined and unclear. Evaluation of any new technique is difficult or impossible because physician experience may be minimal or lacking. Patient expectations may be distorted. It has been difficult to establish clear cut indications for artificial disc replacement. It may not be a replacement procedure or alternative to fusion, since recent studies have shown that 100% of fusion patients had one or more contraindications to disc replacement. The role of disc replacement must come from new indications not defined in today's literature or a relaxation of current contraindications.\nA study by Regan found the result of replacement was the same at L4-5 and L5-S1 with the CHARITE disc. However, the ProDisc II had more favorable results at L4-5 compared with L5-S1.\nA younger age was predictive of a better outcome in several studies. In others it has been found to be a negative predictor or of no predictive value. Older patients may have more complications.\nPrior spinal surgery has mixed effects on disc replacement. It has been reported to be negative in several studies. It has been reported to have no effect in other studies. Many studies are simply inconclusive. Existing evidence does not allow drawing definite conclusions about the status of disc replacement at present.\nElectrical stimulation.\nMany failed back patients are significantly impaired by chronic pain in the back and legs. Many of these will be treated with some form of electrical stimulation. This can be either a transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation device placed on the skin over the back or a nerve stimulator implanted into the back with electrical probes which directly touch the spinal cord. Also, some chronic pain patients utilize fentanyl or narcotic patches. These patients are generally severely impaired and it is unrealistic to conclude that application of neurostimulation will reduce that impairment. For example, it is doubtful that neurostimulation will improve the patient enough to return to competitive employment. Neurostimulation is palliative. TENS units work by blocking neurotransmission as described by the pain theory of Melzack and Wall. Success rates for implanted neurostimulation has been reported to be 25% to 55%. Success is defined as a relative decrease in pain.\nChiropractic.\nLimited case series have shown improvement for patients with failed back surgery who were managed with chiropractic care.\nPrognosis.\nUnder rules promulgated by Titles II and XVI of the United States Social Security Act, chronic radiculopathy, arachnoiditis and spinal stenosis are recognized as disabling conditions under Listing 1.04 A (radiculopathy), 1.04 B (arachnoiditis) and 1.04 C (spinal stenosis). \nReturn to work.\nIn a groundbreaking Canadian study, Waddell \"et al.\" reported on the value of repeat surgery and the return to work in worker's compensation cases. They concluded that workers who undergo spinal surgery take longer to return to their jobs. Once two spinal surgeries are performed, few if any ever return to gainful employment of any kind. After two spinal surgeries, most people in the worker's comp system will not be made better by more surgery. Most will be worse after a third surgery.\nEpisodes of back pain associated with on the job injuries in the worker's compensation setting are usually of short duration. About 10% of such episodes will not be simple, and will degenerate into chronic and disabling back pain conditions, even if surgery is not performed.\nIt has been hypothesized that job dissatisfaction and individual perception of physical demands are associated with an increased time of recovery or an increased risk of no recovery at all. Individual psychological and social work factors, as well as worker-employer relations are also likely to be associated with time and rates of recovery.\nA Finnish study of return to work in patients with spinal stenosis treated by surgery found that: (1) none of the patients who had retired before the operation returned to work afterward. (2) The variables that predicted postoperative ability to work for women were: being fit to work at the time of operation, age &lt; 50 years at the time of operation, and duration of lumbar spinal stenosis symptoms &lt; 2 years. (3) For men, these variables were: being fit to work at the time of operation, age &lt; 50 years at the time of operation, no prior surgery, and the extent of the surgical procedure equal to or less than one laminectomy. Women's and men's working capacity do not differ after lumbar spinal stenosis operation. If the aim is to maximize working capacity, then, when a lumbar spinal stenosis operation is indicated, it should be performed without delay. In lumbar spinal stenosis patients who are &gt; 50 years old and on sick leave, it is unrealistic to expect that they will return to work. Therefore, after such an extensive surgical procedure, re-education of patients for lighter jobs could improve the chances of these patients returning to work.\nIn a related Finnish study, a total of 439 patients operated on for lumbar spinal stenosis during the period 1974\u20131987 was re-examined and evaluated for working and functional capacity approximately 4 years after the decompressive surgery. The ability to work before or after the operation and a history of no prior back surgery were variables predictive of a good outcome. Before the operation 86 patients were working, 223 patients were on sick leave, and 130 patients were retired. After the operation 52 of the employed patients and 70 of the unemployed patients returned to work. None of the retired patients returned to work. Ability to work preoperatively, age under 50 years at the time of operation and the absence of prior back surgery predicted a postoperative ability to work.\nA report from Belgium noted that patients reportedly return to work an average of 12 to 16 weeks after surgery for lumbar disc herniation. However, there are studies that lend credence to the value of an earlier stimulation for return to work and performance of normal activities after a limited discectomy. At follow-up assessment, it was found that no patient had changed employment because of back or leg pain.\nThe sooner the recommendation is made to return to work and perform normal activities, the more likely the patient is to comply. Patients with ongoing disabling back conditions have a low priority for return to work. The probability of return to work decreases as time off work increases. This is especially true in Belgium, where 20% of individuals did not resume work activities after surgery for a disc herniation of the lumbar spine.\nIn Belgium, the medical advisers of sickness funds have an important role legally in the assessment of working capacity and medical rehabilitation measures for employees whose fitness for work is jeopardized or diminished for health reasons. The measures are laid down in the sickness and invalidity legislation. They are in accordance with the principle of preventing long-term disability. It is apparent from the authors' experience that these measures are not adapted consistently in medical practice. Most of the medical advisers are focusing purely on evaluation of corporal damage, leaving little or no time for rehabilitation efforts. In many other countries, the evaluation of work capacity is done by social security doctors with a comparable task.\nIn a comprehensive set of studies carried out by the University of Washington School of Medicine, it was determined that the outcome of lumbar fusion performed on injured workers was worse than reported in most published case series. They found 68% of lumbar fusion patients still unable to return to work two years after surgery. This was in stark contrast to reports of 68% post-op satisfaction in many series. In a follow-up study it was found that the use of intervertebral fusion devices rose rapidly after their introduction in 1996. This increase in metal usage was associated with a greater risk of complication without improving disability or re-operation rates.\nResearch.\nThe identification of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) as a central cause of inflammatory spinal pain now suggests the possibility of an entirely new approach to selected patients with FBSS. Specific and potent inhibitors of TNF became available in the U.S. in 1998, and were demonstrated to be potentially effective for treating sciatica in experimental models beginning in 2001. Targeted anatomic administration of one of these anti-TNF agents, etanercept, a patented treatment method, has been suggested in published pilot studies to be effective for treating selected patients with chronic disc-related pain and FBSS. The scientific basis for pain relief in these patients is supported by the many current review articles. In the future new imaging methods may allow non-invasive identification of sites of neuronal inflammation, thereby enabling more accurate localization of the \"pain generators\" responsible for symptom production. These treatments are still experimental.\nIf chronic pain in FBSS has a chemical component producing inflammatory pain, then prior to additional surgery it may make sense to use an anti-inflammatory approach. Often this is first attempted with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, but the long-term use of Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) for patients with persistent back pain is complicated by their possible cardiovascular and gastrointestinal toxicity; and NSAIDs have limited value to intervene in TNF-mediated processes. An alternative often employed is the injection of cortisone into the spine adjacent to the suspected pain generator, a technique known as \"epidural steroid injection\". Although this technique began more than a decade ago for FBSS, the efficacy of epidural steroid injections is now generally thought to be limited to short term pain relief in selected patients only. In addition, epidural steroid injections, in certain settings, may result in serious complications. Fortunately there are now emerging new methods that directly target TNF. These TNF-targeted methods represent a highly promising new approach for patients with chronic severe spinal pain, such as those with FBSS. Ancillary approaches, such as rehabilitation, physical therapy, anti-depressants, and, in particular, graduated exercise programs, may all be useful adjuncts to anti-inflammatory approaches. In addition, more invasive modalities, such as spinal cord stimulation, may offer relief for certain patients with FBSS, but these modalities, although often referred to as \"minimally invasive\", require additional surgery, and have complications of their own.\nWorldwide perspective.\nA report from Spain noted that the investigation and development of new techniques for instrumented surgery of the spine is not free from conflicts of interest. The influence of financial forces in the development of new technologies and its immediate application to spine surgery, shows the relationship between the published results and the industry support. Authors who have developed and defended fusion techniques have also published new articles praising new spinal technologies. The author calls spinal surgery the \"American Stock and Exchange\" and \"the bubble of spine surgery\". The scientific literature doesn't show clear evidence in the cost-benefit studies of most instrumented surgical interventions of the spine compared with the conservative treatments. It has not been yet demonstrated that fusion surgery and disc replacement are better options than the conservative treatment. It's necessary to point out that at present \"there are relationships between the industry and back pain, and there is also an industry of the back pain\". Nonetheless, the \"market of the spine surgery\" is growing because patients are demanding solutions for their back problems. The tide of scientific evidence seems to go against the spinal fusions in the degenerative disc disease, discogenic pain and in specific back pain. After decades of advances in this field, the results of spinal fusions are mediocre. New epidemiological studies show that \"spinal fusion must be accepted as a non proved or experimental method for the treatment of back pain\". The surgical literature on spinal fusion published in the last 20 years establishes that instrumentation seems to slightly increase the fusion rate and that instrumentation doesn't improve the clinical results in general. We still are in need of randomized studies to compare the surgical results with the natural history of the disease, the placebo effect, or conservative treatment. The European Guidelines for lumbar chronic pain management show \"strong evidence\" indicating that complex and demanding spine surgery where different instrumentation is used, is not more effective than a simple, safer and cheaper posterolateral fusion without instrumentation. Recently, the literature published in this field is sending a message to use \"minimally invasive techniques\"; \u2013 the abandonment of transpedicular fusions. Surgery in general, and usage of metal fixation should be discarded in most cases.\nIn Sweden, the national registry of lumbar spine surgery reported in the year 2000 that 15% of patients with spinal stenosis surgery underwent a concomitant fusion. Despite the traditionally conservative approach to spinal surgery in Sweden, there have been calls from that country for a more aggressive approach to lumbar procedures in recent years.\nCherkin et al., evaluated worldwide surgical attitudes. There were twice the number of surgeons per capita in the United States compared to the United Kingdom. Numbers were similar to Sweden. Despite having very few spinal surgeons, the Netherlands proved to be quite aggressive in surgery. Sweden, despite having a large number of surgeons was conservative and produced relatively few surgeries. The most surgeries were done in the United States. In the UK, more than a third of non-urgent patients waited over a year to see a spinal surgeon. In Wales, more than half waited over three months for consult. Lower rates of referrals in the United Kingdom was found to discourage surgery in general. Fee for service and easy access to care was thought to encourage spinal surgery in the United States, whereas salaried position and a conservative philosophy led to less surgery in the United Kingdom. There were more spinal surgeons in Sweden than in the United States. However, it was speculated that the Swedish surgeons being limited to compensation of 40\u201348 hours a week might lead to a conservative philosophy. There have been calls for a more aggressive approach to lumbar surgery in both the United Kingdom and Sweden in recent years."}
{"title": "Cholera", "label": "Disease", "text": "Cholera is an infection of the small intestine by some strains of the bacterium \"Vibrio cholerae\". Symptoms may range from none, to mild, to severe. The classic symptom is large amounts of watery diarrhea that lasts a few days. Vomiting and muscle cramps may also occur. Diarrhea can be so severe that it leads within hours to severe dehydration and electrolyte imbalance. This may result in sunken eyes, cold skin, decreased skin elasticity, and wrinkling of the hands and feet. Dehydration can cause the skin to turn bluish. Symptoms start two hours to five days after exposure.\nCholera is caused by a number of types of \"Vibrio cholerae\", with some types producing more severe disease than others. It is spread mostly by unsafe water and unsafe food that has been contaminated with human feces containing the bacteria. Undercooked seafood is a common source. Humans are the only known host for the bacteria. Risk factors for the disease include poor sanitation, not enough clean drinking water, and poverty. Cholera can be diagnosed by a stool test. A rapid dipstick test is available but is not as accurate.\nPrevention methods against cholera include improved sanitation and access to clean water. Cholera vaccines that are given by mouth provide reasonable protection for about six months. They have the added benefit of protecting against another type of diarrhea caused by \"E.\u00a0coli\". The primary treatment is oral rehydration therapy\u2014the replacement of fluids with slightly sweet and salty solutions. Rice-based solutions are preferred. Zinc supplementation is useful in children. In severe cases, intravenous fluids, such as Ringer's lactate, may be required, and antibiotics may be beneficial. Testing to see which antibiotic the cholera is susceptible to can help guide the choice.\nCholera affects an estimated 3\u20135\u00a0million people worldwide and causes 28,800\u2013130,000\u00a0deaths a year. Although it is classified as a pandemic , it is rare in high income countries. Children are mostly affected. Cholera occurs as both outbreaks and chronically in certain areas. Areas with an ongoing risk of disease include Africa and Southeast Asia. The risk of death among those affected is usually less than 5% but may be as high as 50%. No access to treatment results in a higher death rate. Descriptions of cholera are found as early as the 5th century BC in Sanskrit. The study of cholera in England by John Snow between 1849 and 1854 led to significant advances in the field of epidemiology. Seven large outbreaks have occurred over the last 200 years with millions of deaths.\nSigns and symptoms.\nThe primary symptoms of cholera are profuse diarrhea and vomiting of clear fluid. These symptoms usually start suddenly, half a day to five days after ingestion of the bacteria. The diarrhea is frequently described as \"rice water\" in nature and may have a fishy odor. An untreated person with cholera may produce of diarrhea a day. Severe cholera, without treatment, kills about half of affected individuals. If the severe diarrhea is not treated, it can result in life-threatening dehydration and electrolyte imbalances. Estimates of the ratio of asymptomatic to symptomatic infections have ranged from 3 to 100. Cholera has been nicknamed the \"blue death\" because a person's skin may turn bluish-gray from extreme loss of fluids.\nFever is rare and should raise suspicion for secondary infection. Patients can be lethargic and might have sunken eyes, dry mouth, cold clammy skin, or wrinkled hands and feet. Kussmaul breathing, a deep and labored breathing pattern, can occur because of acidosis from stool bicarbonate losses and lactic acidosis associated with poor perfusion. Blood pressure drops due to dehydration, peripheral pulse is rapid and thready, and urine output decreases with time. Muscle cramping and weakness, altered consciousness, seizures, or even coma due to electrolyte imbalances are common, especially in children.\nCause.\nTransmission.\nCholera bacteria have been found in shellfish and plankton.\nTransmission is usually through the fecal-oral route of contaminated food or water caused by poor sanitation. Most cholera cases in developed countries are a result of transmission by food, while in developing countries it is more often water. Food transmission can occur when people harvest seafood such as oysters in waters infected with sewage, as \"Vibrio cholerae\" accumulates in planktonic crustaceans and the oysters eat the zooplankton.\nPeople infected with cholera often have diarrhea, and disease transmission may occur if this highly liquid stool, colloquially referred to as \"rice-water\", contaminates water used by others. A single diarrheal event can cause a one-million fold increase in numbers of \"V. cholerae\" in the environment. The source of the contamination is typically other cholera sufferers when their untreated diarrheal discharge is allowed to get into waterways, groundwater or drinking water supplies. Drinking any contaminated water and eating any foods washed in the water, as well as shellfish living in the affected waterway, can cause a person to contract an infection. Cholera is rarely spread directly from person to person.\n\"V. cholerae\" also exists outside the human body in natural water sources, either by itself or through interacting with phytoplankton, zooplankton, or biotic and abiotic detritus. Drinking such water can also result in the disease, even without prior contamination through fecal matter. Selective pressures exist however in the aquatic environment that may reduce the virulence of \"V. cholerae\". Specifically, animal models indicate that the transcriptional profile of the pathogen changes as it prepares to enter an aquatic environment. This transcriptional change results in a loss of ability of \"V. cholerae\" to be cultured on standard media, a phenotype referred to as 'viable but non-culturable' (VBNC) or more conservatively 'active but non-culturable' (ABNC). One study indicates that the culturability of \"V. cholerae\" drops 90% within 24 hours of entering the water, and furthermore that this loss in culturability is associated with a loss in virulence.\nBoth toxic and non-toxic strains exist. Non-toxic strains can acquire toxicity through a temperate bacteriophage.\nSusceptibility.\nAbout 100million bacteria must typically be ingested to cause cholera in a normal healthy adult. This dose, however, is less in those with lowered gastric acidity (for instance those using proton pump inhibitors). Children are also more susceptible, with two- to four-year-olds having the highest rates of infection. Individuals' susceptibility to cholera is also affected by their blood type, with those with type O blood being the most susceptible. Persons with lowered immunity, such as persons with AIDS or malnourished children, are more likely to experience a severe case if they become infected. Any individual, even a healthy adult in middle age, can experience a severe case, and each person's case should be measured by the loss of fluids, preferably in consultation with a professional health care provider.\nThe cystic fibrosis genetic mutation known as delta-F508 in humans has been said to maintain a selective heterozygous advantage: heterozygous carriers of the mutation (who are thus not affected by cystic fibrosis) are more resistant to \"V. cholerae\" infections. In this model, the genetic deficiency in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator channel proteins interferes with bacteria binding to the intestinal epithelium, thus reducing the effects of an infection.\nMechanism.\nWhen consumed, most bacteria do not survive the acidic conditions of the human stomach. The few surviving bacteria conserve their energy and stored nutrients during the passage through the stomach by shutting down protein production. When the surviving bacteria exit the stomach and reach the small intestine, they must propel themselves through the thick mucus that lines the small intestine to reach the intestinal walls where they can attach and thrive.\nOnce the cholera bacteria reach the intestinal wall, they no longer need the flagella to move. The bacteria stop producing the protein flagellin to conserve energy and nutrients by changing the mix of proteins that they express in response to the changed chemical surroundings. On reaching the intestinal wall, \"V. cholerae\" start producing the toxic proteins that give the infected person a watery diarrhea. This carries the multiplying new generations of \"V. cholerae\" bacteria out into the drinking water of the next host if proper sanitation measures are not in place.\nThe cholera toxin (CTX or CT) is an oligomeric complex made up of six protein subunits: a single copy of the A subunit (part A), and five copies of the B subunit (part B), connected by a disulfide bond. The five B subunits form a five-membered ring that binds to GM1 gangliosides on the surface of the intestinal epithelium cells. The A1 portion of the A subunit is an enzyme that ADP-ribosylates G proteins, while the A2 chain fits into the central pore of the B subunit ring. Upon binding, the complex is taken into the cell via receptor-mediated endocytosis. Once inside the cell, the disulfide bond is reduced, and the A1 subunit is freed to bind with a human partner protein called ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (Arf6). Binding exposes its active site, allowing it to permanently ribosylate the Gs alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein. This results in constitutive cAMP production, which in turn leads to the secretion of water, sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate into the lumen of the small intestine and rapid dehydration. The gene encoding the cholera toxin was introduced into \"V. cholerae\" by horizontal gene transfer. Virulent strains of \"V. cholerae\" carry a variant of a temperate bacteriophage called CTX\u03c6.\nMicrobiologists have studied the genetic mechanisms by which the \"V. cholerae\" bacteria turn off the production of some proteins and turn on the production of other proteins as they respond to the series of chemical environments they encounter, passing through the stomach, through the mucous layer of the small intestine, and on to the intestinal wall. Of particular interest have been the genetic mechanisms by which cholera bacteria turn on the protein production of the toxins that interact with host cell mechanisms to pump chloride ions into the small intestine, creating an ionic pressure which prevents sodium ions from entering the cell. The chloride and sodium ions create a salt-water environment in the small intestines, which through osmosis can pull up to six liters of water per day through the intestinal cells, creating the massive amounts of diarrhea. The host can become rapidly dehydrated unless treated properly.\nBy inserting separate, successive sections of \"V. cholerae\" DNA into the DNA of other bacteria, such as \"E. coli\" that would not naturally produce the protein toxins, researchers have investigated the mechanisms by which \"V. cholerae\" responds to the changing chemical environments of the stomach, mucous layers, and intestinal wall. Researchers have discovered a complex cascade of regulatory proteins controls expression of \"V. cholerae\" virulence determinants. In responding to the chemical environment at the intestinal wall, the \"V. cholerae\" bacteria produce the TcpP/TcpH proteins, which, together with the ToxR/ToxS proteins, activate the expression of the ToxT regulatory protein. ToxT then directly activates expression of virulence genes that produce the toxins, causing diarrhea in the infected person and allowing the bacteria to colonize the intestine. Current research aims at discovering \"the signal that makes the cholera bacteria stop swimming and start to colonize (that is, adhere to the cells of) the small intestine.\"\nGenetic structure.\nAmplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting of the pandemic isolates of \"V. cholerae\" has revealed variation in the genetic structure. Two clusters have been identified: Cluster I and Cluster II. For the most part, Cluster I consists of strains from the 1960s and 1970s, while Cluster II largely contains strains from the 1980s and 1990s, based on the change in the clone structure. This grouping of strains is best seen in the strains from the African continent.\nAntibiotic resistance.\nIn many areas of the world, antibiotic resistance is increasing within cholera bacteria. In Bangladesh, for example, most cases are resistant to tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and erythromycin. Rapid diagnostic assay methods are available for the identification of multi-drug resistant cases. New generation antimicrobials have been discovered which are effective against cholera bacteria in \"in vitro\" studies.\nDiagnosis.\nA rapid dipstick test is available to determine the presence of \"V. cholerae\". In those samples that test positive, further testing should be done to determine antibiotic resistance. In epidemic situations, a clinical diagnosis may be made by taking a patient history and doing a brief examination. Treatment is usually started without or before confirmation by laboratory analysis.\nStool and swab samples collected in the acute stage of the disease, before antibiotics have been administered, are the most useful specimens for laboratory diagnosis. If an epidemic of cholera is suspected, the most common causative agent is \"V. cholerae\" O1. If \"V. cholerae\" serogroup O1 is not isolated, the laboratory should test for \"V. cholerae\" O139. However, if neither of these organisms is isolated, it is necessary to send stool specimens to a reference laboratory.\nInfection with \"V. cholerae\" O139 should be reported and handled in the same manner as that caused by \"V. cholerae\" O1. The associated diarrheal illness should be referred to as cholera and must be reported in the United States.\nPrevention.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) recommends focusing on prevention, preparedness, and response to combat the spread of cholera. They also stress the importance of an effective surveillance system. Governments can play a role in all of these areas.\nWater, sanitation and hygiene.\nAlthough cholera may be life-threatening, prevention of the disease is normally straightforward if proper sanitation practices are followed. In developed countries, due to nearly universal advanced water treatment and sanitation practices present there, cholera is rare. For example, the last major outbreak of cholera in the United States occurred in 1910\u20131911. Cholera is mainly a risk in developing countries in those areas where access to WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) infrastructure is still inadequate.\nEffective sanitation practices, if instituted and adhered to in time, are usually sufficient to stop an epidemic. There are several points along the cholera transmission path at which its spread may be halted:\nHandwashing with soap or ash after using a toilet and before handling food or eating is also recommended for cholera prevention by WHO Africa.\nSurveillance.\nSurveillance and prompt reporting allow for containing cholera epidemics rapidly. Cholera exists as a seasonal disease in many endemic countries, occurring annually mostly during rainy seasons. Surveillance systems can provide early alerts to outbreaks, therefore leading to coordinated response and assist in preparation of preparedness plans. Efficient surveillance systems can also improve the risk assessment for potential cholera outbreaks. Understanding the seasonality and location of outbreaks provides guidance for improving cholera control activities for the most vulnerable. For prevention to be effective, it is important that cases be reported to national health authorities.\nVaccination.\nSpanish physician Jaume Ferran i Clua developed a cholera inoculation in 1885, the first to immunize humans against a bacterial disease. However, his vaccine and inoculation was rather controversial and was rejected by his peers and several investigation commissions. Russian-Jewish bacteriologist Waldemar Haffkine successfully developed the first human cholera vaccine in July 1892. He conducted a massive inoculation program in British India.\nA number of safe and effective oral vaccines for cholera are available. The World Health Organization (WHO) has three prequalified oral cholera vaccines (OCVs): Dukoral, Sanchol, and Euvichol. Dukoral, an orally administered, inactivated whole cell vaccine, has an overall efficacy of about 52% during the first year after being given and 62% in the second year, with minimal side effects. It is available in over 60 countries. However, it is not currently recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for most people traveling from the United States to endemic countries. The vaccine that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends, Vaxchora, is an oral attenuated live vaccine, that is effective as a single dose.\nOne injectable vaccine was found to be effective for two to three years. The protective efficacy was 28% lower in children less than five years old. However, , it has limited availability. Work is under way to investigate the role of mass vaccination. The WHO recommends immunization of high-risk groups, such as children and people with HIV, in countries where this disease is endemic. If people are immunized broadly, herd immunity results, with a decrease in the amount of contamination in the environment.\nWHO recommends that oral cholera vaccination be considered in areas where the disease is endemic (with seasonal peaks), as part of the response to outbreaks, or in a humanitarian crisis during which the risk of cholera is high. Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) has been recognized as an adjunct tool for prevention and control of cholera. The World Health Organization (WHO) has prequalified three bivalent cholera vaccines\u2014Dukoral (SBL Vaccines), containing a non-toxic B-subunit of cholera toxin and providing protection against V. cholerae O1; and two vaccines developed using the same transfer of technology\u2014ShanChol (Shantha Biotec) and Euvichol (EuBiologics Co.), which have bivalent O1 and O139 oral killed cholera vaccines. Oral cholera vaccination could be deployed in a diverse range of situations from cholera-endemic areas and locations of humanitarian crises, but no clear consensus exists.\nSari filtration.\nDeveloped for use in Bangladesh, the \"sari filter\" is a simple and cost-effective appropriate technology method for reducing the contamination of drinking water. Used sari cloth is preferable but other types of used cloth can be used with some effect, though the effectiveness will vary significantly. Used cloth is more effective than new cloth, as the repeated washing reduces the space between the fibers. Water collected in this way has a greatly reduced pathogen count\u2014though it will not necessarily be perfectly safe, it is an improvement for poor people with limited options. In Bangladesh this practice was found to decrease rates of cholera by nearly half. It involves folding a \"sari\" four to eight times. Between uses the cloth should be rinsed in clean water and dried in the sun to kill any bacteria on it. A nylon cloth appears to work as well but is not as affordable.\nTreatment.\nContinued eating speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function. The WHO recommends this generally for cases of diarrhea no matter what the underlying cause. A CDC training manual specifically for cholera states: \"Continue to breastfeed your baby if the baby has watery diarrhea, even when traveling to get treatment. Adults and older children should continue to eat frequently.\"\nFluids.\nThe most common error in caring for patients with cholera is to underestimate the speed\nand volume of fluids required. In most cases, cholera can be successfully treated with oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which is highly effective, safe, and simple to administer. Rice-based solutions are preferred to glucose-based ones due to greater efficiency. In severe cases with significant dehydration, intravenous rehydration may be necessary. Ringer's lactate is the preferred solution, often with added potassium. Large volumes and continued replacement until diarrhea has subsided may be needed. Ten percent of a person's body weight in fluid may need to be given in the first two to four hours. This method was first tried on a mass scale during the Bangladesh Liberation War, and was found to have much success. Despite widespread beliefs, fruit juices and commercial fizzy drinks like cola are not ideal for rehydration of people with serious infections of the intestines, and their excessive sugar content may even harm water uptake.\nIf commercially produced oral rehydration solutions are too expensive or difficult to obtain, solutions can be made. One such recipe calls for 1 liter of boiled water, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, 6 teaspoons of sugar, and added mashed banana for potassium and to improve taste.\nElectrolytes.\nAs there frequently is initially acidosis, the potassium level may be normal, even though large losses have occurred. As the dehydration is corrected, potassium levels may decrease rapidly, and thus need to be replaced. This may be done by consuming foods high in potassium, like bananas or coconut water.\nAntibiotics.\nAntibiotic treatments for one to three days shorten the course of the disease and reduce the severity of the symptoms. Use of antibiotics also reduces fluid requirements. People will recover without them, however, if sufficient hydration is maintained. The WHO only recommends antibiotics in those with severe dehydration.\nDoxycycline is typically used first line, although some strains of \"V. cholerae\" have shown resistance. Testing for resistance during an outbreak can help determine appropriate future choices. Other antibiotics proven to be effective include cotrimoxazole, erythromycin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, and furazolidone. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, also may be used, but resistance has been reported.\nAntibiotics improve outcomes in those who are both severely and not severely dehydrated. Azithromycin and tetracycline may work better than doxycycline or ciprofloxacin.\nZinc supplementation.\nIn Bangladesh zinc supplementation reduced the duration and severity of diarrhea in children with cholera when given with antibiotics and rehydration therapy as needed. It reduced the length of disease by eight hours and the amount of diarrhea stool by 10%. Supplementation appears to be also effective in both treating and preventing infectious diarrhea due to other causes among children in the developing world.\nPrognosis.\nIf people with cholera are treated quickly and properly, the mortality rate is less than 1%; however, with untreated cholera, the mortality rate rises to 50\u201360%.\nFor certain genetic strains of cholera, such as the one present during the 2010 epidemic in Haiti and the 2004 outbreak in India, death can occur within two hours of becoming ill.\nEpidemiology.\nCholera affects an estimated 2.8\u00a0million people worldwide, and causes approximately 95,000\u00a0deaths a year (uncertainty range: 21,000-143,000) . This occurs mainly in the developing world. In the early 1980s, death rates are believed to have been greater than three million a year. It is difficult to calculate exact numbers of cases, as many go unreported due to concerns that an outbreak may have a negative impact on the tourism of a country. Cholera remains both epidemic and endemic in many areas of the world. In October 2016, an outbreak of cholera began in war-ravaged Yemen. WHO called it \"the worst cholera outbreak in the world\".\nRecent major outbreaks are the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak and the 2016\u20132021 Yemen cholera outbreak. In 2019, 93% of the reported 923,037 cholera cases were from Yemen (with 1911 deaths reported). Between September 2019 and September 2020, a global total of over 450,000 cases and over 900 deaths was reported; however these numbers suffer from over-reporting from countries that report suspected cases (and not laboratory confirmed cases) as well as under-reporting from countries that do not report official cases (such as Bangladesh, India and Philippines).\nAlthough much is known about the mechanisms behind the spread of cholera, this has not led to a full understanding of what makes cholera outbreaks happen in some places and not others. Lack of treatment of human feces and lack of treatment of drinking water greatly facilitate its spread, but bodies of water can serve as a reservoir, and seafood shipped long distances can spread the disease.\nCholera was not known in the Americas for most of the 20th century, but it reappeared towards the end of that century. After the end of the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak, there have not been any cholera cases in the Americas since February 2019. the disease is endemic in Africa and some areas of Asia (Bangladesh, India and Yemen). Cholera is not endemic in Europe, all reported cases had a travel history to endemic areas.\nHistory of outbreaks.\nThe word cholera is from \"kholera\" from \u03c7\u03bf\u03bb\u03ae \"khol\u0113\" \"bile\". Cholera likely has its origins in the Indian subcontinent as evidenced by its prevalence in the region for centuries.\nThe disease appears in the European literature as early as 1642, from the Dutch physician Jakob de Bondt's description it in his De Medicina Indorum. (The \"Indorum\" of the title refers to the East Indies. He also gave first European descriptions of other diseases.)\nEarly outbreaks in the Indian subcontinent are believed to have been the result of poor living conditions as well as the presence of pools of still water, both of which provide ideal conditions for cholera to thrive. The disease first spread by trade routes (land and sea) to Russia in 1817, later to the rest of Europe, and from Europe to North America and the rest of the world, (hence the name \"Asiatic cholera\"). Seven cholera pandemics have occurred in the past 200 years, with the seventh pandemic originating in Indonesia in 1961.\nThe first cholera pandemic occurred in the Bengal region of India, near Calcutta starting in 1817 through 1824. The disease dispersed from India to Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Eastern Africa. The movement of British Army and Navy ships and personnel is believed to have contributed to the range of the pandemic, since the ships carried people with the disease to the shores of the Indian Ocean, from Africa to Indonesia, and north to China and Japan. The second pandemic lasted from 1826 to 1837 and particularly affected North America and Europe due to the result of advancements in transportation and global trade, and increased human migration, including soldiers. The third pandemic erupted in 1846, persisted until 1860, extended to North Africa, and reached South America, for the first time specifically affecting Brazil. The fourth pandemic lasted from 1863 to 1875 spread from India to Naples and Spain. The fifth pandemic was from 1881\u20131896 and started in India and spread to Europe, Asia, and South America. The sixth pandemic started 1899\u20131923. These epidemics were less fatal due to a greater understanding of the cholera bacteria. Egypt, the Arabian peninsula, Persia, India, and the Philippines were hit hardest during these epidemics, while other areas, like Germany in 1892 (primarily the city of Hamburg where more than 8.600 people died) and Naples from 1910\u20131911, also experienced severe outbreaks. The seventh pandemic originated in 1961 in Indonesia and is marked by the emergence of a new strain, nicknamed \"El Tor\", which still persists () in developing countries.\nCholera became widespread in the 19th century. Since then it has killed tens of millions of people. In Russia alone, between 1847 and 1851, more than one million people perished of the disease. It killed 150,000 Americans during the second pandemic. Between 1900 and 1920, perhaps eight million people died of cholera in India. Cholera became the first reportable disease in the United States due to the significant effects it had on health. John Snow, in England, was the first to identify the importance of contaminated water as its cause in 1854. Cholera is now no longer considered a pressing health threat in Europe and North America due to filtering and chlorination of water supplies, but still heavily affects populations in developing countries.\nIn the past, vessels flew a yellow quarantine flag if any crew members or passengers were suffering from cholera. No one aboard a vessel flying a yellow flag would be allowed ashore for an extended period, typically 30 to 40 days.\nHistorically many different claimed remedies have existed in folklore. Many of the older remedies were based on the miasma theory. Some believed that abdominal chilling made one more susceptible and flannel and cholera belts were routine in army kits. In the 1854\u20131855 outbreak in Naples homeopathic camphor was used according to Hahnemann. T. J. Ritter's \"Mother's Remedies\" book lists tomato syrup as a home remedy from northern America. Elecampane was recommended in the United Kingdom according to William Thomas Fernie. The first effective human vaccine was developed in 1885, and the first effective antibiotic was developed in 1948.\nCholera cases are much less frequent in developed countries where governments have helped to establish water sanitation practices and effective medical treatments. The United States, for example, used to have a severe cholera problem similar to those in some developing countries. There were three large cholera outbreaks in the 1800s, which can be attributed to \"Vibrio cholerae\"'s spread through interior waterways like the Erie Canal and routes along the Eastern Seaboard. The island of Manhattan in New York City touched the Atlantic Ocean, where cholera collected just off the coast. At this time, New York City did not have as effective a sanitation system as it does today, so cholera was able to spread.\nCholera morbus is a historical term that was used to refer to gastroenteritis rather than specifically cholera.\nResearch.\nOne of the major contributions to fighting cholera was made by the physician and pioneer medical scientist John Snow (1813\u20131858), who in 1854 found a link between cholera and contaminated drinking water. Dr. Snow proposed a microbial origin for epidemic cholera in 1849. In his major \"state of the art\" review of 1855, he proposed a substantially complete and correct model for the cause of the disease. In two pioneering epidemiological field studies, he was able to demonstrate human sewage contamination was the most probable disease vector in two major epidemics in London in 1854. His model was not immediately accepted, but it was seen to be the more plausible, as medical microbiology developed over the next 30 years or so. For his work on cholera, John Snow is often regarded as the \"Father of Epidemiology\".\nThe bacterium was isolated in 1854 by Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini, but its exact nature and his results were not widely known. In the same year, the Catalan Joaquim Balcells i Pascual discovered the bacterium and in 1856 probably Ant\u00f3nio Augusto da Costa Sim\u00f5es and Jos\u00e9 Ferreira de Macedo Pinto, two Portuguese men, did the same.\nCities in developed nations made massive investment in clean water supply and well-separated sewage treatment infrastructures between the mid-1850s and the 1900s. This eliminated the threat of cholera epidemics from the major developed cities in the world. In 1883, Robert Koch identified \"V. cholerae\" with a microscope as the bacillus causing the disease.\nHemendra Nath Chatterjee, a Bengali scientist, who first formulated and demonstrated the effectiveness of oral rehydration salt (ORS) for diarrhea. In his 1953 paper, published in The Lancet, he states that promethazine can stop vomiting during cholera and then oral rehydration is possible. The formulation of the fluid replacement solution was 4\u00a0g of sodium chloride, 25\u00a0g of glucose and 1000\u00a0ml of water.\nIndian medical scientist Sambhu Nath De discovered the cholera toxin, the \"animal model of cholera\", and successfully demonstrate the method of transmission of cholera pathogen \"Vibrio cholerae\".\nRobert Allan Phillips, working at the US Naval Medical Research Unit Two in Southeast Asia, evaluated the pathophysiology of the disease using modern laboratory chemistry techniques and developed a protocol for rehydration. His research led the Lasker Foundation to award him its prize in 1967.\nMore recently, in 2002, Alam, \"et al.\", studied stool samples from patients at the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease in Dhaka, Bangladesh. From the various experiments they conducted, the researchers found a correlation between the passage of \"V. cholerae\" through the human digestive system and an increased infectivity state. Furthermore, the researchers found the bacterium creates a hyperinfected state where genes that control biosynthesis of amino acids, iron uptake systems, and formation of periplasmic nitrate reductase complexes were induced just before defecation. These induced characteristics allow the cholera vibrios to survive in the \"rice water\" stools, an environment of limited oxygen and iron, of patients with a cholera infection.\nGlobal Strategy.\nIn 2017, the WHO launched the \"Ending Cholera: a global roadmap to 2030\" strategy which aims to reduce cholera deaths by 90% by 2030. The strategy was developed by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) which develops country-specific plans and monitors progress. The approach to achieve this goal combines surveillance, water sanitation, treatment and oral vaccines. Specifically, the control strategy focusses on three approaches: i) early detection and response to outbreaks to contain outbreaks, ii) stopping cholera transmission through improved sanitation and vaccines in hotspots, and iii) a global framework for cholera control through the GTFCC.\nThe WHO and the GTFCC do not consider global cholera eradication a viable goal. Even though humans are the only host of cholera, the bacterium can persist in the environment without a human host. While global eradication is not possible, elimination of human to human transmission may be possible; and local elimination is possible, most recently during the 2010s Haiti cholera outbreak which aims to achieve certification of elimination by 2022.\nThe GTFCC targets 47 countries, 13 of which have established vaccination campaigns.\nSociety and culture.\nHealth policy.\nIn many developing countries, cholera still reaches its victims through contaminated water sources, and countries without proper sanitation techniques have greater incidence of the disease. Governments can play a role in this. In 2008, for example, the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak was due partly to the government's role, according to a report from the James Baker Institute. The Haitian government's inability to provide safe drinking water after the 2010 earthquake led to an increase in cholera cases as well.\nSimilarly, South Africa's cholera outbreak was exacerbated by the government's policy of privatizing water programs. The wealthy elite of the country were able to afford safe water while others had to use water from cholera-infected rivers.\nAccording to Rita R. Colwell of the James Baker Institute, if cholera does begin to spread, government preparedness is crucial. A government's ability to contain the disease before it extends to other areas can prevent a high death toll and the development of an epidemic or even pandemic. Effective disease surveillance can ensure that cholera outbreaks are recognized as soon as possible and dealt with appropriately. Oftentimes, this will allow public health programs to determine and control the cause of the cases, whether it is unsanitary water or seafood that have accumulated a lot of \"Vibrio cholerae\" specimens. Having an effective surveillance program contributes to a government's ability to prevent cholera from spreading. In the year 2000 in the state of Kerala in India, the Kottayam district was determined to be \"Cholera-affected\"; this pronouncement led to task forces that concentrated on educating citizens with 13,670 information sessions about human health. These task forces promoted the boiling of water to obtain safe water, and provided chlorine and oral rehydration salts. Ultimately, this helped to control the spread of the disease to other areas and minimize deaths. On the other hand, researchers have shown that most of the citizens infected during the 1991 cholera outbreak in Bangladesh lived in rural areas, and were not recognized by the government's surveillance program. This inhibited physicians' abilities to detect cholera cases early.\nAccording to Colwell, the quality and inclusiveness of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, as it did in the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. While sanitation practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor. The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important.\nBesides contributing to an effective or declining public health care system and water sanitation treatments, government can have indirect effects on cholera control and the effectiveness of a response to cholera. A country's government can impact its ability to prevent disease and control its spread. A speedy government response backed by a fully functioning health care system and financial resources can prevent cholera's spread. This limits cholera's ability to cause death, or at the very least a decline in education, as children are kept out of school to minimize the risk of infection.\nIn popular culture.\nUnlike tuberculosis (\"consumption\") which in literature and the arts was often romanticized as a disease of denizens of the demimonde or those with an artistic temperament, cholera is a disease which almost entirely affects the lower-classes living in filth and poverty. This, and the unpleasant course of the disease \u2013 which includes voluminous \"rice-water\" diarrhea, the hemorrhaging of liquids from the mouth, and violent muscle contractions which continue even after death \u2013 has discouraged the disease from being romanticized, or even the actual factual presentation of the disease in popular culture.\nCountry examples.\nZambia.\nIn Zambia, widespread cholera outbreaks have occurred since 1977, most commonly in the capital city of Lusaka. In 2017, an outbreak of cholera was declared in Zambia after laboratory confirmation of \"Vibrio cholerae\" O1, biotype El Tor, serotype Ogawa, from stool samples from two patients with acute watery diarrhea. There was a rapid increase in the number of cases from several hundred cases in early December 2017 to approximately 2,000 by early January 2018. With intensification of the rains, new cases increased on a daily basis reaching a peak on the first week of January 2018 with over 700 cases reported.\nIn collaboration with partners, the Zambia Ministry of Health (MoH) launched a multifaceted public health response that included increased chlorination of the Lusaka municipal water supply, provision of emergency water supplies, water quality monitoring and testing, enhanced surveillance, epidemiologic investigations, a cholera vaccination campaign, aggressive case management and health care worker training, and laboratory testing of clinical samples.\nThe Zambian Ministry of Health implemented a reactive one-dose Oral Cholera Vaccine (OCV) campaign in April 2016 in three Lusaka compounds, followed by a pre-emptive second-round in December.\nIndia.\nIn the city of Kolkata, India in the state of West Bengal in the Ganges delta has been described as the \"homeland of cholera\", with regular outbreaks and pronounced seasonality. In India, where the disease is endemic, cholera outbreaks occur every year between dry seasons and rainy seasons. India is also characterized by high population density, unsafe drinking water, open drains, and poor sanitation which provide an optimal niche for survival, sustenance and transmission of \"Vibrio cholerae\".\nDemocratic Republic of Congo.\nIn Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, cholera has left an enduring mark on human and medical history. Cholera pandemics in the 19th and 20th centuries led to the growth of epidemiology as a science and in recent years it has continued to press advances in the concepts of disease ecology, basic membrane biology, and transmembrane signaling and in the use of scientific information and treatment design."}
{"title": "Rectal_prolapse", "label": "Disease", "text": "Rectal prolapse is when the rectal walls have prolapsed to a degree where they protrude out the anus and are visible outside the body. However, most researchers agree that there are 3 to 5 different types of rectal prolapse, depending on if the prolapsed section is visible externally, and if the full or only partial thickness of the rectal wall is involved.\nRectal prolapse may occur without any symptoms, but depending upon the nature of the prolapse there may be mucous discharge (mucus coming from the anus), rectal bleeding, degrees of fecal incontinence and obstructed defecation symptoms.\nRectal prolapse is generally more common in elderly women, although it may occur at any age and in either sex. It is very rarely life-threatening, but the symptoms can be debilitating if left untreated. Most external prolapse cases can be treated successfully, often with a surgical procedure. Internal prolapses are traditionally harder to treat and surgery may not be suitable for many patients. \nClassification.\nThe different kinds of rectal prolapse can be difficult to grasp, as different definitions are used and some recognize some subtypes and others do not. Essentially, rectal prolapses may be\nExternal (complete) rectal prolapse (rectal procidentia, full thickness rectal prolapse, external rectal prolapse) is\na full thickness, circumferential, true intussusception of the rectal wall which protrudes from the anus and is visible externally.\nInternal rectal intussusception (occult rectal prolapse, internal procidentia) can be defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the upper rectal (or lower sigmoid) wall that can occur during defecation. This infolding is perhaps best visualised as folding a sock inside out, creating \"a tube within a tube\". Another definition is \"where the rectum collapses but does not exit the anus\". Many sources differentiate between internal rectal intussusception and mucosal prolapse, implying that the former is a full thickness prolapse of rectal wall. However, a publication by the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons stated that internal rectal intussusception involved the mucosal and submucosal layers separating from the underlying muscularis mucosa layer attachments, resulting in the separated portion of rectal lining \"sliding\" down. This may signify that authors use the terms internal rectal prolapse and internal mucosal prolapse to describe the same phenomena.\nMucosal prolapse (partial rectal mucosal prolapse) refers to prolapse of the loosening of the submucosal attachments to the muscularis propria of the distal rectummucosal layer of the rectal wall. Most sources define mucosal prolapse as an external, segmental prolapse which is easily confused with prolapsed (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids (piles). However, both internal mucosal prolapse (see below) and circumferential mucosal prolapse are described by some. Others do not consider mucosal prolapse a true form of rectal prolapse.\nInternal mucosal prolapse (rectal internal mucosal prolapse, RIMP) refers to prolapse of the mucosal layer of the rectal wall which does not protrude externally. There is some controversy surrounding this condition as to its relationship with hemorrhoidal disease, or whether it is a separate entity. The term \"mucosal hemorrhoidal prolapse\" is also used.\nSolitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS, solitary rectal ulcer, SRU) occurs with internal rectal intussusception and is part of the spectrum of rectal prolapse conditions. It describes ulceration of the rectal lining caused by repeated frictional damage as the internal intussusception is forced into the anal canal during straining. SRUS can be considered a consequence of internal intussusception, which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases.\nMucosal prolapse syndrome (MPS) is recognized by some. It includes solitary rectal ulcer syndrome, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps. It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder.\nRectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception has been classified according to the size of the prolapsed section of rectum, a function of rectal mobility from the sacrum and infolding of the rectum. This classification also takes into account sphincter relaxation: \nRectal internal mucosal prolapse has been graded according to the level of descent of the intussusceptum, which was predictive of symptom severity: \nThe most widely used classification of internal rectal prolapse is according to the height on the rectal/sigmoid wall from which they originate and by whether the intussusceptum remains within the rectum or extends into the anal canal. The height of intussusception from the anal canal is usually estimated by defecography.\nRecto-rectal (high) intussusception (intra-rectal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum, does not protrude into the anal canal, but stays within the rectum. (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum and does not extend into the anal canal. The intussuscipiens includes rectal lumen distal to the intussusceptum only). These are usually intussusceptions that originate in the upper rectum or lower sigmoid.\nRecto-anal (low) intussusception (intra-anal intussusception) is where the intussusception starts in the rectum and protrudes into the anal canal (i.e. the intussusceptum originates in the rectum, and the intussuscipiens includes part of the anal canal)\nAn Anatomico-Functional Classification of internal rectal intussusception has been described, with the argument that other factors apart from the height of intussusception above the anal canal appear to be important to predict symptomology. The parameters of this classification are anatomic descent, diameter of intussuscepted bowel, associated rectal hyposensitivity and associated delayed colonic transit:\nDiagnosis.\nHistory.\nPatients may have associated gynecological conditions which may require multidisciplinary management. History of constipation is important because some of the operations may worsen constipation. Fecal incontinence may also influence the choice of management.\nPhysical examination.\nRectal prolapse may be confused easily with prolapsing hemorrhoids. Mucosal prolapse also differs from prolapsing (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids, where there is a segmental prolapse of the hemorrhoidal tissues at the 3, 7 and 11 o'clock positions. Mucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse (a complete rectal prolapse) by the orientation of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential. In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially. The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids. Furthermore, in rectal prolapse, there is a sulcus present between the prolapsed bowel and the anal verge, whereas in hemorrhoidal disease there is no sulcus. Prolapsed, incarcerated hemorrhoids are extremely painful, whereas as long as a rectal prolapse is not strangulated, it gives little pain and is easy to reduce.\nThe prolapse may be obvious, or it may require straining and squatting to produce it. The anus is usually patulous, (loose, open) and has reduced resting and squeeze pressures. Sometimes it is necessary to observe the patient while they strain on a toilet to see the prolapse happen (the perineum can be seen with a mirror or by placing an endoscope in the bowl of the toilet). A phosphate enema may need to be used to induce straining.\nThe perianal skin may be macerated (softening and whitening of skin that is kept constantly wet) and show excoriation.\nProctoscopy/sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy.\nThese may reveal congestion and edema (swelling) of the distal rectal mucosa, and in 10-15% of cases there may be a solitary rectal ulcer on the anterior rectal wall. Localized inflammation or ulceration can be biopsied and may lead to a diagnosis of SRUS or colitis cystica profunda. Rarely, a neoplasm (tumour) may form on the leading edge of the intussusceptum. In addition, patients are frequently elderly and therefore have increased incidence of colorectal cancer. Full length colonoscopy is usually carried out in adults prior to any surgical intervention. These investigations may be used with contrast media (barium enema) which may show the associated mucosal abnormalities.\nVideodefecography.\nThis investigation is used to diagnose internal intussusception, or demonstrate a suspected external prolapse that could not be produced during the examination. It is usually not necessary with obvious external rectal prolapse. Defecography may demonstrate associated conditions like cystocele, vaginal vault prolapse or enterocele.\nColonic transit studies.\nColonic transit studies may be used to rule out colonic inertia if there is a history of severe constipation. Continent prolapse patients with slow transit constipation, and who are fit for surgery may benefit from subtotal colectomy with rectopexy.\nAnorectal manometry.\nThis investigation objectively documents the functional status of the sphincters. However, the clinical significance of the findings are disputed by some. It may be used to assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia, (anismus is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative biofeedback therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse. Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse. In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence.\nAnal electromyography/Pudendal nerve testing.\nIt may be used to evaluate incontinence, but there is disagreement about what relevance the results may show, as rarely do they mandate a change of surgical plan. There may be denervation of striated musculature on the electromyogram. Increased nerve conduction periods (nerve damage), this may be significant in predicting post-operative incontinence.\nComplete rectal prolapse.\nRectal prolapse is a \"falling down\" of the rectum so that it is visible externally. The appearance is of a reddened, proboscis-like object through the anal sphincters. Patients find the condition embarrassing. The symptoms can be socially debilitating without treatment, but it is rarely life-threatening.\nThe true incidence of rectal prolapse is unknown, but it is thought to be uncommon. As most sufferers are elderly, the condition is generally under-reported. It may occur at any age, even in children, but there is peak onset in the fourth and seventh decades. Women over 50 are six times more likely to develop rectal prolapse than men. It is rare in men over 45 and in women under 20. When males are affected, they tend to be young and report significant bowel function symptoms, especially obstructed defecation, or have a predisposing disorder (e.g., congenital anal atresia). When children are affected, they are usually under the age of 3.\n35% of women with rectal prolapse have never had children, suggesting that pregnancy and labour are not significant factors. Anatomical differences such as the wider pelvic outlet in females may explain the skewed gender distribution.\nAssociated conditions, especially in younger patients include autism, developmental delay syndromes and psychiatric conditions requiring several medications.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSigns and symptoms include:\nInitially, the mass may protrude through the anal canal only during defecation and straining, and spontaneously return afterwards. Later, the mass may have to be pushed back in following defecation. This may progress to a chronically prolapsed and severe condition, defined as spontaneous prolapse that is difficult to keep inside, and occurs with walking, prolonged standing, coughing or sneezing (Valsalva maneuvers). A chronically prolapsed rectal tissue may undergo pathological changes such as thickening, ulceration and bleeding.\nIf the prolapse becomes trapped externally outside the anal sphincters, it may become strangulated and there is a risk of perforation. This may require an urgent surgical operation if the prolapse cannot be manually reduced. Applying granulated sugar on the exposed rectal tissue can reduce the edema (swelling) and facilitate this.\nCause.\nThe precise cause is unknown, and has been much debated. In 1912 Moschcowitz proposed that rectal prolapse was a sliding hernia through a pelvic fascial defect.\nThis theory was based on the observation that rectal prolapse patients have a mobile and unsupported pelvic floor, and a hernia sac of peritoneum from the Pouch of Douglas and rectal wall can be seen. Other adjacent structures can sometimes be seen in addition to the rectal prolapse. Although a pouch of Douglas hernia, originating in the cul de sac of Douglas, may protrude from the anus (via the anterior rectal wall), this is a different situation from rectal prolapse.\nShortly after the invention of defecography, In 1968 Broden and Snellman used cinedefecography to show that rectal prolapse begins as a circumferential intussusception of the rectum, which slowly increases over time. The leading edge of the intussusceptum may be located at 6\u20138\u00a0cm or at 15\u201318\u00a0cm from the anal verge. This proved an older theory from the 18th century by John Hunter and Albrecht von Haller that this condition is essentially a full-thickness rectal intussusception, beginning about 3 inches above the dentate line and protruding externally.\nSince most patients with rectal prolapse have a long history of constipation, it is thought that prolonged, excessive and repetitive straining during defecation may predispose to rectal prolapse. Since rectal prolapse itself causes functional obstruction, more straining may result from a small prolapse, with increasing damage to the anatomy. This excessive straining may be due to predisposing pelvic floor dysfunction (e.g. obstructed defecation) and anatomical factors:\nSome authors question whether these abnormalities are the cause, or secondary to the prolapse. Other predisposing factors/associated conditions include: \nThe association with uterine prolapse (10-25%) and cystocele (35%) may suggest that there is some underlying abnormality of the pelvic floor that affects multiple pelvic organs. Proximal bilateral pudendal neuropathy has been demonstrated in patients with rectal prolapse who have fecal incontinence. This finding was shown to be absent in healthy subjects, and may be the cause of denervation-related atrophy of the external anal sphincter. Some authors suggest that pudendal nerve damage is the cause for pelvic floor and anal sphincter weakening, and may be the underlying cause of a spectrum of pelvic floor disorders.\nSphincter function in rectal prolapse is almost always reduced. This may be the result of direct sphincter injury by chronic stretching of the prolapsing rectum. Alternatively, the intussuscepting rectum may lead to chronic stimulation of the rectoanal inhibitory reflex (RAIR - contraction of the external anal sphincter in response to stool in the rectum). The RAIR was shown to be absent or blunted. Squeeze (maximum voluntary contraction) pressures may be affected as well as the resting tone. This is most likely a denervation injury to the external anal sphincter.\nThe assumed mechanism of fecal incontinence in rectal prolapse is by the chronic stretch and trauma to the anal sphincters and the presence of a direct conduit (the intussusceptum) connecting rectum to the external environment which is not guarded by the sphincters.\nThe assumed mechanism of obstructed defecation is by disruption to the rectum and anal canal's ability to contract and fully evacuate rectal contents. The intussusceptum itself may mechanically obstruct the rectoanal lumen, creating a blockage that straining, anismus and colonic dysmotility exacerbate.\nSome believe that internal rectal intussusception represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. However, internal intussusception rarely progresses to external rectal prolapse. The factors that result in a patient progressing from internal intussusception to a full thickness rectal prolapse remain unknown. Defecography studies demonstrated that degrees of internal intussusception are present in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.\nTreatment.\nConservative.\nSurgery is thought to be the only option to potentially cure a complete rectal prolapse. For people with medical problems that make them unfit for surgery, and those who have minimal symptoms, conservative measures may be beneficial. Dietary adjustments, including increasing dietary fiber may be beneficial to reduce constipation, and thereby reduce straining. A bulk forming agent (e.g. psyllium) or stool softener can also reduce constipation.\nSurgical.\nSurgery is often required to prevent further damage to the anal sphincters. The goals of surgery are to restore the normal anatomy and to minimize symptoms. There is no globally agreed consensus as to which procedures are more effective, and there have been over 50 different operations described.\nSurgical approaches in rectal prolapse can be either perineal or abdominal. A perineal approach (or trans-perineal) refers to surgical access to the rectum and sigmoid colon via an incision around the anus and perineum (the area between the genitals and the anus). Abdominal approach (trans-abdominal approach) involves the surgeon cutting into the abdomen and gaining surgical access to the pelvic cavity. Procedures for rectal prolapse may involve fixation of the bowel (rectopexy), or resection (a portion removed), or both. Trans-anal (endo-anal) procedures are also described where access to the internal rectum is gained through the anus itself.\nAbdominal procedures.\nThe abdominal approach carries a small risk of impotence in males (e.g. 1-2% in abdominal rectopexy). Abdominal operations may be open or laparoscopic (keyhole surgery).\nLaparoscopic procedures\nRecovery time following laparoscopic surgery is shorter and less painful than following traditional abdominal surgery. Instead of opening the pelvic cavity with a wide incision (laparotomy), a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) and surgical instruments are inserted into the pelvic cavity via small incisions. Rectopexy and anterior resection have been performed laparoscopically with good results.\nPerineal procedures.\nThe perineal approach generally results in less post-operative pain and complications, and a reduced length of hospital stay. These procedures generally carry a higher recurrence rate and poorer functional outcome. The perineal procedures include perineal rectosigmoidectomy and Delorme repair. Elderly, or other medically high-risk patients are usually treated by perineal procedures, as they can be performed under a regional anesthetic, or even local anesthetic with intravenous sedation, thus avoid the risks of a general anesthetic. Alternatively, perineal procedures may be selected to reduce risk of nerve damage, for example in young male patients for whom sexual dysfunction may be a major concern.\nPerineal rectosigmoidectomy\nThe goal of Perineal rectosigmoidectomy is to resect or remove the redundant bowel. This is done through the perineum. The lower rectum is anchored to the sacrum through fibrosis in order to prevent future prolapse. The full thickness of the rectal wall is incised at a level just above the dentate line. Redundant rectal and sigmoid wall is removed and the new edge of colon is reconnected (anastomosed) with the anal canal with stitches or staples. This procedure may be combined with levatorplasty, to tighten the pelvic muscles. A combined a perineal proctosigmoidectomy with anterior levatorplasty is also called an Altemeier procedure. Levatorplasty is performed to correct levator diastasis which is commonly associated with rectal prolapse. Perineal rectosigmoidectomy was first introduced by Mikulicz in 1899, and it remained the preferred treatment in Europe for many years. It was Popularized by Altemeier. The procedure is simple, safe and effective. Continence levatorplasty may enhance restoration of continence (2/3 of patients). Complications occur in less than 10% of cases, and include pelvic bleeding, pelvic abscess and anastomotic dehiscence (splitting apart of the stitches inside), bleeding or leak at a dehiscence Mortality is low. Recurrence rates are higher than for abdominal repair, 16-30%, but more recent studies give lower recurrence rates. Additional levatorplasty can reduce recurrence rates to 7%.\nDelorme Procedure\nThis is a modification of the perineal rectosigmoidectomy, differing in that only the mucosa and submucosa are excised from the prolapsed segment, rather than full thickness resection. The prolapse is exposed if it is not already present, and the mucosal and submucosal layers are stripped from the redundant length of bowel. The muscle layer that is left is plicated (folded) and placed as a buttress above the pelvic floor. The edges of the mucosal are then stitched back together. \"Mucosal proctectomy\" was first discussed by Delorme in 1900, now it is becoming more popular again as it has low morbidity and avoids an abdominal incision, while effectively repairing the prolapse. The procedure is ideally suited to those patients with full-thickness prolapse limited to partial circumference (e.g., anterior wall) or less-extensive prolapse (perineal rectosigmoidectomy may be difficult in this situation). Fecal incontinence is improved following surgery (40%\u201375% of patients). Post operatively, both mean resting and squeeze pressures were increased. Constipation is improved in 50% of cases, but often urgency and tenesmus are created. Complications, including infection, urinary retention, bleeding, anastomotic dehiscence (opening of the stitched edges inside), stricture (narrowing of the gut lumen), diarrhea, and fecal impaction occur in 6-32% of cases. Mortality occurs in 0\u20132.5% cases. There is a higher recurrence rate than abdominal approaches (7-26% cases).\nAnal encirclement (Thirsch procedure)\nThis procedure can be carried out under local anaesthetic. After reduction of the prolapse, a subcutaneous suture (a stich under the skin) or other material is placed encircling the anus, which is then made taut to prevent further prolapse. Placing silver wire around the anus first described by Thiersch in 1891. Materials used include nylon, silk, silastic rods, silicone, Marlex mesh, Mersilene mesh, fascia, tendon, and Dacron. This operation does not correct the prolapse itself, it merely supplements the anal sphincter, narrowing the anal canal with the aim of preventing the prolapse from becoming external, meaning it remains in the rectum. This goal is achieved in 54-100% cases. Complications include breakage of the encirclement material, fecal impaction, sepsis, and erosion into the skin or anal canal. Recurrence rates are higher than the other perineal procedures. This procedure is most often used for people who have a severe condition or who have a high risk of adverse effects from general anesthetic, and who may not tolerate other perineal procedures.\nInternal rectal intussusception.\nInternal rectal intussusception (rectal intussusception, internal intussusception, internal rectal prolapse, occult rectal prolapse, internal rectal procidentia and rectal invagination) is a medical condition defined as a funnel shaped infolding of the rectal wall that can occur during defecation.\nThis phenomenon was first described in the late 1960s when defecography was first developed and became widespread. Degrees of internal intussusception have been demonstrated in 40% of asymptomatic subjects, raising the possibility that it represents a normal variant in some, and may predispose patients to develop symptoms, or exacerbate other problems.\nSymptoms.\nInternal intussusception may be asymptomatic, but common symptoms include:\nRecto-rectal intussusceptions may be asymptomatic, apart from mild obstructed defecation. \"interrupted defaecation\" in the morning is thought by some to be characteristic.\nRecto-anal intussusceptions commonly give more severe symptoms of straining, incomplete evacuation, need for digital evacuation of stool, need for support of the perineum during defecation, urgency, frequency or intermittent fecal incontinence.\nIt has been observed that intussusceptions of thickness \u22653\u00a0mm, and those that appear to cause obstruction to rectal evacuation may give clinical symptoms.\nCause.\nThere are two schools of thought regarding the nature of internal intussusception, viz: whether it is a primary phenomenon, or secondary to (a consequence of) another condition.\nSome believe that it represents the initial form of a progressive spectrum of disorders the extreme of which is external rectal prolapse. The intermediary stages would be gradually increasing sizes of intussusception. The folding section of rectum can cause repeated trauma to the mucosa, and can cause solitary rectal ulcer syndrome. However, internal intussusception rarely progress to external rectal prolapse.\nOthers argue that the majority of patients appear to have rectal intussusception as a consequence of obstructed defecation rather than a cause, possibly related to excessive straining in patients with obstructed defecation. Patients with other causes of obstructed defecation (outlet obstruction) like anismus also tend to have higher incidence of internal intussusception. Enteroceles are coexistent in 11% of patients with internal intussusception. Symptoms of internal intussusception overlap with those of rectocele, indeed the 2 conditions can occur together.\nPatients with solitary rectal ulcer syndrome combined with internal intussusception (as 94% of SRUS patients have) were shown to have altered rectal wall biomechanics compared to patients with internal intussusception alone. The presumed mechanism of the obstructed defecation is by telescoping of the intussusceptum, occluding the rectal lumen during attempted defecation. One study analysed resected rectal wall specimens in patients with obstructed defecation associated with rectal intussusception undergoing stapled trans-anal rectal resection. They reported abnormalities of the enteric nervous system and estrogen receptors. One study concluded that intussusception of the anterior rectal wall shares the same cause as rectocele, namely deficient recto-vaginal ligamentous support.\nComorbidities and complications.\nThe following conditions occur more commonly in patients with internal rectal intussusception than in the general population:\nDiagnosis.\nUnlike external rectal prolapse, internal rectal intussusception is not visible externally, but it may still be diagnosed by digital rectal examination, while the patient strains as if to defecate. Imaging such as a defecating proctogram or dynamic MRI defecography can demonstrate the abnormal folding of the rectal wall. Some have advocated the use of anorectal physiology testing (anorectal manometry).\nTreatment.\nNon surgical measures to treat internal intussusception include pelvic floor retraining, a bulking agent (e.g. psyllium), suppositories or enemas to relieve constipation and straining. If there is incontinence (fecal leakage or more severe FI), or paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor (anismus), then biofeedback retraining is indicated. Some researchers advise that internal intussusception be managed conservatively, compared to external rectal prolapse which usually requires surgery.\nAs with external rectal prolapse, there are a great many different surgical interventions described. Generally, a section of rectal wall can be resected (removed), or the rectum can be fixed (rectopexy) to its original position against the sacral vertebrae, or a combination of both methods. Surgery for internal rectal prolapse can be via the abdominal approach or the transanal approach.\nIt is clear that there is a wide spectrum of symptom severity, meaning that some patients may benefit from surgery and others may not. Many procedures receive conflicting reports of success, leading to a lack of any consensus about the best way to manage this problem. Relapse of the intussusception after treatment is a problem. Two of the most commonly employed procedures are discussed below.\nlaparoscopic ventral (mesh) rectopexy (LVR).\nThis procedure aims to \"[correct] the descent of the posterior and middle pelvic compartments combined with reinforcement of the rectovaginal septum\".\nRectopexy has been shown to improve anal incontinence (fecal leakage) in patients with rectal intussusception. The operation has been shown to have low recurrence rate (around 5%). It also improves obstructed defecation symptoms.\nComplications include constipation, which is reduced if the technique does not use posterior rectal mobilization (freeing the rectum from its attached back surface).\nThe advantage of the laproscopic approach is decreased healing time and less complications.\nStapled trans-anal rectal resection (STARR).\nThis operation aims to \"remove the anorectal mucosa circumferential and reinforce the anterior anorectal junction wall with the use of a circular stapler\". In contrast to other methods, STARR does not correct the descent of the rectum, it removes the redundant tissue. The technique was developed from a similar stapling procedure for prolapsing hemorrhoids. Since, specialized circular staplers have been developed for use in external rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception.\nComplications, sometimes serious, have been reported following STARR, but the procedure is now considered safe and effective. STARR is contraindicated in patients with weak sphincters (fecal incontinence and urgency are a possible complication) and with anismus (paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor during attempted defecation). The operation has been shown to improve rectal sensitivity and decrease rectal volume, the reason thought to create urgency. 90% of patients do not report urgency 12 months after the operation. The anal sphincter may also be stretched during the operation. STARR was compared with biofeedback and found to be more effective at reducing symptoms and improving quality of life.\nMucosal prolapse.\nRectal mucosal prolapse (mucosal prolapse, anal mucosal prolapse) is a sub-type of rectal prolapse, and refers to abnormal descent of the rectal mucosa through the anus. It is different to an internal intussusception (occult prolapse) or a complete rectal prolapse (external prolapse, procidentia) because these conditions involve the full thickness of the rectal wall, rather than only the mucosa (lining).\nMucosal prolapse is a different condition to prolapsing (3rd or 4th degree) hemorrhoids, although they may look similar.\nRectal mucosal prolapse can be a cause of obstructed defecation (outlet obstruction). and rectal malodor.\nSymptoms.\nSymptom severity increases with the size of the prolapse, and whether it spontaneously reduces after defecation, requires manual reduction by the patient, or becomes irreducible. The symptoms are identical to advanced hemorrhoidal disease, and include:\nCause.\nThe condition, along with complete rectal prolapse and internal rectal intussusception, is thought to be related to chronic straining during defecation and constipation.\nMucosal prolapse occurs when the results from loosening of the submucosal attachments (between the mucosal layer and the muscularis propria) of the distal rectum. The section of prolapsed rectal mucosa can become ulcerated, leading to bleeding.\nDiagnosis.\nMucosal prolapse can be differentiated from a full thickness external rectal prolapse (a complete rectal prolapse) by the orientation of the folds (furrows) in the prolapsed section. In full thickness rectal prolapse, these folds run circumferential. In mucosal prolapse, these folds are radially. The folds in mucosal prolapse are usually associated with internal hemorrhoids.\nTreatment.\n (examination under anesthesia) of anorectum and banding of the mucosa with rubber bands.\nSolitary rectal ulcer syndrome and colitis cystica profunda.\nSolitary rectal ulcer syndrome (SRUS, SRU), is a disorder of the rectum and anal canal, caused by straining and increased pressure during defecation. This increased pressure causes the anterior portion of the rectal lining to be forced into the anal canal (an internal rectal intussusception). The lining of the rectum is repeatedly damaged by this friction, resulting in ulceration. SRUS can therefore be considered to be a consequence of internal intussusception (a sub type of rectal prolapse), which can be demonstrated in 94% of cases. It may be asymptomatic, but it can cause rectal pain, rectal bleeding, rectal malodor, incomplete evacuation and obstructed defecation (rectal outlet obstruction).\nSymptoms.\nSymptoms include:\nPrevalence.\nThe condition is thought to be uncommon. It usually occurs in young adults, but children can be affected too.\nCause.\nThe essential cause of SRUS is thought to be related to too much straining during defecation.\nOveractivity of the anal sphincter during defecation causes the patient to require more effort to expel stool. This pressure is produced by the modified valsalva manovoure (attempted forced exhalation against a closed glottis, resulting in increased abdominal and intra-rectal pressure). Patiest with SRUS were shown to have higher intra-rectal pressures when straining than healthy controls. SRUS is also associated with prolonged and incomplete evacuation of stool.\nMore effort is required because of concomitant anismus, or non-relaxation/paradoxical contraction of puborectalis (which should normally relax during defecation). The increased pressure forces the anterior rectal lining against the contracted puborectalis and frequently the lining prolapses into the anal canal during straining and then returns to its normal position afterwards.\nThe repeated trapping of the lining can cause the tissue to become swollen and congested. Ulceration is thought to be caused by resulting poor blood supply (ischemia), combined with repeated frictional trauma from the prolapsing lining, and exposure to increased pressure are thought to cause ulceration. Trauma from hard stools may also contribute.\nThe site of the ulcer is typically on the anterior wall of the rectal ampulla, about 7\u201310\u00a0cm from the anus. However, the area may of ulceration may be closer to the anus, deeper inside, or on the lateral or posterior rectal walls. The name \"solitary\" can be misleading since there may be more than one ulcer present. Furthermore, there is a \"preulcerative phase\" where there is no ulcer at all.\nPathological specimens of sections of rectal wall taken from SRUS patients show thickening and replacement of muscle with fibrous tissue and excess collagen. Rarely, SRUS can present as polyps in the rectum.\nSRUS is therefore associated and with internal, and more rarely, external rectal prolapse. Some believe that SRUS represents a spectrum of different diseases with different causes.\nAnother condition associated with internal intussusception is colitis cystica profunda (also known as CCP, or proctitis cystica profunda), which is cystica profunda in the rectum. Cystica profunda is characterized by formation of mucin cysts in the muscle layers of the gut lining, and it can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. When it occurs in the rectum, some believe to be an interchangeable diagnosis with SRUS since the histologic features of the conditions overlap. Indeed, CCP is managed identically to SRUS.\nElectromyography may show pudendal nerve motor latency.\nComplications.\nComplications are uncommon, but include massive rectal bleeding, ulceration into the prostate gland or formation of a stricture. Very rarely, cancer can arise on the section of prolapsed rectal lining.\nDiagnosis and investigations.\nSRUS is commonly misdiagnosed, and the diagnosis is not made for 5\u20137 years. Clinicians may not be familiar with the condition, and treat for Inflammatory bowel disease, or simple constipation.\nThe thickened lining or ulceration can also be mistaken for types of cancer.\nThe differential diagnosis of SRUS (and CCP) includes:\nDefecography, sigmoidoscopy, transrectal ultrasound, mucosal biopsy, anorectal manometry and electromyography have all been used to diagnose and study SRUS. Some recommend biopsy as essential for diagnosis since ulcerations may not always be present, and others state defecography as the investigation of choice to diagnose SRUS.\nTreatment.\nAlthough SRUS is not a medically serious disease, it can be the cause of significantly reduced quality of life for patients. It is difficult to treat, and treatment is aimed at minimizing symptoms.\nStopping straining during bowel movements, by use of correct posture, dietary fiber intake (possibly included bulk forming laxatives such as psyllium), stool softeners (e.g. polyethylene glycol, and biofeedback retraining to coordinate pelvic floor during defecation.\nSurgery may be considered, but only if non surgical treatment has failed and the symptoms are severe enough to warrant the intervention. Improvement with surgery is about 55-60%.\nUlceration may persist even when symptoms resolve.\nMucosal prolapse syndrome.\nA group of conditions known as Mucosal prolapse syndrome (MPS) has now been recognized. It includes SRUS, rectal prolapse, proctitis cystica profunda, and inflammatory polyps. It is classified as a chronic benign inflammatory disorder. The unifying feature is varying degrees of rectal prolapse, whether internal intussusception (occult prolapse) or external prolapse.\nEpidemiology.\nRectal prolapse affects less than 0.5% of the general population. It affects women more commonly, with a female to male ratio of 9:1.\nPornography.\nRosebud pornography and Prolapse pornography (or rosebudding or rectal prolapse pornography) is an anal sex practice that occurs in some extreme anal pornography wherein a pornographic actor or actress performs a rectal prolapse wherein the walls of the rectum slip out of the anus. Rectal prolapse is a serious medical condition that requires the attention of a medical professional. However, in rosebud pornography, it is performed deliberately. Michelle Lhooq, writing for VICE, argues that rosebudding is an example of producers making 'extreme' content due to the easy availability of free pornography on the internet. She also argues that rosebudding is a way for pornographic actors and actresses to distinguish themselves. Repeated rectal prolapses can cause bowel problems and anal leakage and therefore risk the health of pornographic actors or actresses who participate in them. Lhooq also argues that some who participate in this form of pornography are unaware of the consequences.\nTerminology.\nProlapse refers to \"the falling down or slipping of a body part from its usual position or relations\". It is derived from the Latin \"pro-\" - \"forward\" + \"labi\" - \"to slide\". Prolapse can refer to many different medical conditions other than rectal prolapse.\nprocidentia has a similar meaning to prolapse, referring to \"a sinking or prolapse of an organ or part\". It is derived from the Latin \"procidere\" - \"to fall forward\". Procidentia usually refers to uterine prolapse, but rectal procidentia can also be a synonym for rectal prolapse.\nIntussusception is defined as invagination (infolding), especially referring to \"the slipping of a length of intestine into an adjacent portion\". It is derived from the Latin \"intus\" - \"within\" and \"susceptio\" - \"action of undertaking\", from \"suscipere\" - \"to take up\". Rectal intussusception is not to be confused with other intussusceptions involving colon or small intestine, which can sometimes be a medical emergency. Rectal intussusception by contrast is not life-threatening.\nIntussusceptum refers to the proximal section of rectal wall, which telescopes into the lumen of the distal section of rectum (termed the intussuscipiens). What results is 3 layers of rectal wall overlaid. From the lumen outwards, the first layer is the proximal wall of the intussusceptum, the middle is the wall of the intussusceptum folded back on itself, and the outer is the distal rectal wall, the intussuscipiens."}
{"title": "Hookworm_infection", "label": "Disease", "text": "Hookworm infection is an infection by a type of intestinal parasite known as a hookworm. Initially, itching and a rash may occur at the site of infection. Those only affected by a few worms may show no symptoms. Those infected by many worms may experience abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and tiredness. The mental and physical development of children may be affected. Anemia may result.\nTwo common hookworm infections in humans are ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis, caused by the species \"Ancylostoma duodenale\" and \"Necator americanus\" respectively. Hookworm eggs are deposited in the stools of infected people. If these end up in the environment, they can hatch into larvae (immature worms), which can then penetrate the skin. One type can also be spread through contaminated food. Risk factors include walking barefoot in warm climates, where sanitation is poor. Diagnosis is by examination of a stool sample with a microscope.\nThe disease can be prevented on an individual level by not walking barefoot in areas where the disease is common. At a population level, decreasing outdoor defecation, not using raw feces as fertilizer, and mass deworming is effective. Treatment is typically with the medications albendazole or mebendazole for one to three days. Iron supplements may be needed in those with anemia.\nHookworms infected about 428 million people in 2015. Heavy infections can occur in both children and adults, but are less common in adults. They are rarely fatal. Hookworm infection is a soil-transmitted helminthiasis and classified as a neglected tropical disease.\nSigns and symptoms.\nNo symptoms or signs are specific for hookworm infection, but they give rise to a combination of intestinal inflammation and progressive iron-deficiency anemia and protein deficiency. Coughing, chest pain, wheezing, and fever sometimes result from severe infection. Epigastric pains, indigestion, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and diarrhea can occur early or in later stages, as well, although gastrointestinal symptoms tend to improve with time. Signs of advanced severe infection are those of anemia and protein deficiency, including emaciation, cardiac failure, and abdominal distension with ascites.\nLarval invasion of the skin (mostly in the Americas) can produce a skin disease called cutaneous larva migrans also known as creeping eruption. The hosts of these worms are not human and the larvae can only penetrate the upper five layers of the skin, where they give rise to intense, local itching, usually on the foot or lower leg, known as ground itch. This infection is due to larvae from the \"A. braziliense\" hookworm. The larvae migrate in tortuous tunnels between the stratum basale and stratum corneum of the skin, causing serpiginous vesicular lesions. With advancing movement of the larvae, the rear portions of the lesions become dry and crusty. The lesions are typically intensely itchy.\nIncubation period.\nThe incubation period can vary between a few weeks to many months, and is largely dependent on the number of hookworm parasites an individual is infected with.\nCause.\nHookworm infections in humans include ancylostomiasis and necatoriasis. Ancylostomiasis is caused by \"Ancylostoma duodenale,\" which is the more common type found in the Middle East, North Africa, India, and (formerly) in southern Europe. Necatoriasis is caused by \"Necator americanus,\" the more common type in the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, China, and Indonesia.\nOther animals such as birds, dogs, and cats may also be affected. \"A. tubaeforme\" infects cats, \"A. caninum\" infects dogs, and \"A. braziliense\" and \"Uncinaria stenocephala\" infect both cats and dogs. Some of these infections can be transmitted to humans.\nMorphology.\n\"A. duodenale\" worms are grayish white or pinkish with the head slightly bent in relation to the rest of the body. This bend forms a definitive hook shape at the anterior end for which hookworms are named. They possess well-developed mouths with two pairs of teeth. While males measure approximately one centimeter by 0.5 millimeter, the females are often longer and stouter. Additionally, males can be distinguished from females based on the presence of a prominent posterior copulatory bursa.\n\"N. americanus\" is very similar in morphology to \"A. duodenale\". \"N. americanus\" is generally smaller than \"A. duodenale\" with males usually 5 to 9\u00a0mm long and females about 1\u00a0cm long. Whereas \"A. duodenale\" possesses two pairs of teeth, \"N. americanus\" possesses a pair of cutting plates in the buccal capsule. Additionally, the hook shape is much more defined in \"Necator\" than in \"Ancylostoma\".\nLife cycle.\nThe hookworm thrives in warm soil where temperatures are over 18\u00a0\u00b0C. They exist primarily in sandy or loamy soil and cannot live in clay or muck. Rainfall averages must be more than 1000\u00a0mm (40\u00a0inches) a year for them to survive. Only if these conditions exist can the eggs hatch. Infective larvae of \"N. americanus\" can survive at higher temperatures, whereas those of \"A. duodenale\" are better adapted to cooler climates. Generally, they live for only a few weeks at most under natural conditions, and die almost immediately on exposure to direct sunlight or desiccation.\nInfection of the host is by the larvae, not the eggs. While \"A. duodenale\" can be ingested, the usual method of infection is through the skin; this is commonly caused by walking barefoot through areas contaminated with fecal matter. The larvae are able to penetrate the skin of the foot, and once inside the body, they migrate through the vascular system to the lungs, and from there up the trachea, and are swallowed. They then pass down the esophagus and enter the digestive system, finishing their journey in the intestine, where the larvae mature into adult worms.\nOnce in the host gut, \"Necator\" tends to cause a prolonged infection, generally 1 to 5 years (many worms die within a year or two of infecting), though some adult worms have been recorded to live for 15 years or more. \"Ancylostoma\" adults are short-lived, surviving on average for only about 6 months. However, the infection can be prolonged because dormant larvae can be \"recruited\" sequentially from tissue \"stores\" (see Pathology, above) over many years, to replace expired adult worms. This can give rise to seasonal fluctuations in infection prevalence and intensity (apart from normal seasonal variations in transmission).\nThey mate inside the host, females laying up to 30,000 eggs per day and some 18 to 54 million eggs during their lifetimes, which pass out in feces. Because 5 to 7 weeks are needed for adult worms to mature, mate, and produce eggs, in the early stages of very heavy infection, acute symptoms might occur without any eggs being detected in the patient's feces. This can make diagnosis very difficult.\n\"N. americanus\" and \"A. duodenale\" eggs can be found in warm, moist soil where they eventually hatch into first-stage larvae, or L1. L1, the feeding noninfective rhabditoform stage, will feed on soil microbes and eventually molt into second-stage larvae, L2, which is also in the rhabditoform stage. It will feed for about 7 days and then molt into the third-stage larvae, or L3. This is the filariform stage of the parasite, that is, the nonfeeding infective form of the larvae. The L3 larvae are extremely motile and seek higher ground to increase their chances of penetrating the skin of a human host. The L3 larvae can survive up to 2 weeks without finding a host. While \"N. americanus\" larvae only infect through penetration of skin, \"A. duodenale\" can infect both through penetration and orally. After the L3 larvae have successfully entered the host, they then travel through the subcutaneous venules and lymphatic vessels of the human host. Eventually, the L3 larvae enter the lungs through the pulmonary capillaries and break out into the alveoli. They then travel up the trachea to be coughed and swallowed by the host. After being swallowed, the L3 larvae are then found in the small intestine, where they molt into the L4, or adult worm stage. The entire process from skin penetration to adult development takes about 5\u20139 weeks. The female adult worms release eggs (\"N. americanus\" about 9,000\u201310,000 eggs/day and \"A. duodenale\" 25,000\u201330,000 eggs/day), which are passed in the feces of the human host. These eggs hatch in the environment within several days and the cycle starts anew.\nPathophysiology.\nHookworm infection is generally considered to be asymptomatic, but as Norman Stoll described in 1962, it is an extremely dangerous infection because its damage is \u201csilent and insidious.\u201d An individual may experience general symptoms soon after infection. Ground-itch, which is an allergic reaction at the site of parasitic penetration and entry, is common in patients infected with \"N. americanus\". Additionally, cough and pneumonitis may result as the larvae begin to break into the alveoli and travel up the trachea. Then once the larvae reach the small intestine of the host and begin to mature, the infected individual will suffer from diarrhea and other gastrointestinal discomfort. However, the \u201csilent and insidious\u201d symptoms referred to by Stoll are related to chronic, heavy-intensity hookworm infections. Major morbidity associated with hookworm infection is caused by intestinal blood loss, iron deficiency anemia, and protein malnutrition. They result mainly from adult hookworms in the small intestine ingesting blood, rupturing erythrocytes, and degrading hemoglobin in the host. This long-term blood loss can manifest itself physically through facial and peripheral edema; eosinophilia and pica caused by iron deficiency anemia are also experienced by some hookworm-infected patients. Recently, more attention has been given to other important outcomes of hookworm infection that play a large role in public health. It is now widely accepted that children who suffer from chronic hookworm infection can suffer from growth retardation as well as intellectual and cognitive impairments. Additionally, recent research has focused on the potential of adverse maternal-fetal outcomes when the mother is infected with hookworm during pregnancy.\nThe disease was linked to nematode worms (\"Ankylostoma duodenalis\") from one-third to half an inch long in the intestine chiefly through the labours of Theodor Bilharz and Griesinger in Egypt (1854).\nThe symptoms can be linked to inflammation in the gut stimulated by feeding hookworms, such as nausea, abdominal pain and intermittent diarrhea, and to progressive anemia in prolonged disease: capricious appetite, pica (or dirt-eating), obstinate constipation followed by diarrhea, palpitations, thready pulse, coldness of the skin, pallor of the mucous membranes, fatigue and weakness, shortness of breath and in cases running a fatal course, dysentery, hemorrhages and edema. The worms suck blood and damage the mucosa. However, the blood loss in the stools is not visibly apparent.\nBlood tests in early infection often show a rise in numbers of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell that is preferentially stimulated by worm infections in tissues (large numbers of eosinophils are also present in the local inflammatory response). Falling blood hemoglobin levels will be seen in cases of prolonged infection with anemia.\nIn contrast to most intestinal helminthiases, where the heaviest parasitic loads tend to occur in children, hookworm prevalence and intensity can be higher among adult males. The explanation for this is that hookworm infection tends to be occupational, so that coworkers and other close groups maintain a high prevalence of infection among themselves by contaminating their work environment. However, in most endemic areas, adult women are the most severely affected by anemia, mainly because they have much higher physiological needs for iron (menstruation, repeated pregnancy).An interesting consequence of this in the case of \"Ancylostoma duodenale\" infection is translactational transmission of infection: the skin-invasive larvae of this species do not all immediately pass through the lungs and on into the gut, but spread around the body via the circulation, to become dormant inside muscle fibers. In a pregnant woman, after childbirth some or all of these larvae are stimulated to re-enter the circulation (presumably by sudden hormonal changes), then to pass into the mammary glands, so that the newborn baby can receive a large dose of infective larvae through its mother's milk. This accounts for otherwise inexplicable cases of very heavy, even fatal, hookworm infections in children a month or so of age, in places such as China, India and northern Australia.\nAn identical phenomenon is much more commonly seen with \"Ancylostoma caninum\" infections in dogs, where the newborn pups can even die of hemorrhaging from their intestines caused by massive numbers of feeding hookworms. This also reflects the close evolutionary link between the human and canine parasites, which probably have a common ancestor dating back to when humans and dogs first started living closely together.\nFilariform larvae is the infective stage of the parasite: infection occurs when larvae in soil penetrate the skin, or when they are ingested through contaminated food and water following skin penetration.\nDiagnosis.\nDiagnosis depends on finding characteristic worm eggs on microscopic examination of the stools, although this is not possible in early infection. Early signs of infection in most dogs include limbular limping and anal itching. The eggs are oval or elliptical, measuring 60 by 40\u00a0\u00b5m, colorless, not bile stained and with a thin transparent hyaline shell membrane. When released by the worm in the intestine, the egg contains an unsegmented ovum. During its passage down the intestine, the ovum develops and thus the eggs passed in feces have a segmented ovum, usually with 4 to 8 blastomeres.\nAs the eggs of both \"Ancylostoma\" and \"Necator\" (and most other hookworm species) are indistinguishable, to identify the genus, they must be cultured in the lab to allow larvae to hatch out. If the fecal sample is left for a day or more under tropical conditions, the larvae will have hatched out, so eggs might no longer be evident. In such a case, it is essential to distinguish hookworms from \"Strongyloides\" larvae, as infection with the latter has more serious implications and requires different management. The larvae of the two hookworm species can also be distinguished microscopically, although this would not be done routinely, but usually for research purposes. Adult worms are rarely seen (except via endoscopy, surgery or autopsy), but if found, would allow definitive identification of the species. Classification can be performed based on the length of the buccal cavity, the space between the oral opening and the esophagus: hookworm rhabditoform larvae have long buccal cavities whereas \"Strongyloides\" rhabditoform larvae have short buccal cavities.\nRecent research has focused on the development of DNA-based tools for diagnosis of infection, specific identification of hookworm, and analysis of genetic variability within hookworm populations. Because hookworm eggs are often indistinguishable from other parasitic eggs, PCR assays could serve as a molecular approach for accurate diagnosis of hookworm in the feces.\nPrevention.\nThe infective larvae develop and survive in an environment of damp dirt, particularly sandy and loamy soil. They cannot survive in clay or muck. The main lines of precaution are those dictated by good hygiene behaviors:\nMoxidectin is available in the United States as (imidacloprid + moxidectin) topical solution for dogs and cats. It utilizes moxidectin for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms.\nChildren.\nMost of these public health concerns have focused on children who are infected with hookworm. This focus on children is largely due to the large body of evidence that has demonstrated strong associations between hookworm infection and impaired learning, increased absences from school, and decreased future economic productivity. In 2001, the 54th World Health Assembly passed a resolution demanding member states to attain a minimum target of regular deworming of at least 75% of all at-risk school children by the year 2010. A 2008 World Health Organization publication reported on these efforts to treat at-risk school children. Some of the interesting statistics were as follows: 1) only 9 out of 130 endemic countries were able to reach the 75% target goal; and 2) less than 77 million school-aged children (of the total 878 million at risk) were reached, which means that only 8.78% of at-risk children are being treated for hookworm infection.\nSchool-based mass deworming.\nSchool-based mass deworming programs have been the most popular strategy to address the issue of hookworm infection in children. School-based programs are extremely cost-effective as schools already have an available, extensive, and sustained infrastructure with a skilled workforce that has a close relationship with the community. With little training from a local health system, teachers can easily administer the drugs which often cost less than US$0.50 per child per year.\nRecently, many people have begun to question if the school-based programs are necessarily the most effective approach. An important concern with school-based programs is that they often do not reach children who do not attend school, thus ignoring a large number of at-risk children. A 2008 study by Massa \"et al.\" continued the debate regarding school-based programs. They examined the effects of community-directed treatments versus school-based treatments in the Tanga Region of Tanzania. A major conclusion was that the mean infection intensity of hookworm was significantly lower in the villages employing the community-directed treatment approach than the school-based approach. The community-directed treatment model used in this specific study allowed villagers to take control of the child's treatment by having villagers select their own community drug distributors to administer the antihelminthic drugs. Additionally, villagers organized and implemented their own methods for distributing the drugs to all children. The positive results associated with this new model highlight the need for large-scale community involvement in deworming campaigns.\nPublic health education.\nMany mass deworming programs also combine their efforts with a public health education. These health education programs often stress important preventative techniques such as: washing your hands before eating, and staying away from water/areas contaminated by human feces. These programs may also stress that shoes must be worn, however, these come with their own health risks and may not be effective. Shoe wearing patterns in towns and villages across the globe are determined by cultural beliefs, and the levels of education within that society. The wearing of shoes will prevent the entry of hookworm infections from the surrounding soils into tender skin regions; such as areas between the toes.\nSanitation.\nHistorical examples, such as the hookworm campaigns in Mississippi and Florida from 1943 to 1947 have shown that the primary cause of hookworm infection is poor sanitation, which can be solved by building and maintaining toilets. But while these may seem like simple tasks, they raise important public health challenges. Most infected populations are from poverty-stricken areas with very poor sanitation. Thus, it is most likely that at-risk children do not have access to clean water to wash their hands and live in environments with no proper sanitation infrastructure. Health education, therefore, must address preventive measures in ways that are both feasible and sustainable in the context of resource-limited settings.\nIntegrated approaches.\nEvaluation of numerous public health interventions has generally shown that improvement in each individual component ordinarily attributed to poverty (for example, sanitation, health education and underlying nutrition status) often have minimal impact on transmission. For example, one study found that the introduction of latrines into a resource-limited community only reduced the prevalence of hookworm infection by four percent. However, another study in Salvador, Brazil found that improved drainage and sewerage had a significant impact on the prevalence of hookworm infection but no impact at all on the intensity of hookworm infection. This seems to suggest that environmental control alone has a limited but incomplete effect on the transmission of hookworms. It is imperative, therefore, that more research is performed to understand the efficacy and sustainability of integrated programs that combine numerous preventive methods including education, sanitation, and treatment.\nTreatment.\nAnthelmintic drugs.\nThe most common treatment for hookworm are benzimidazoles, specifically albendazole and mebendazole. BZAs kill adult worms by binding to the nematode's \u03b2-tubulin and subsequently inhibiting microtubule polymerization within the parasite. In certain circumstances, levamisole and pyrantel pamoate may be used. A 2008 review found that the efficacy of single-dose treatments for hookworm infections were as follows: 72% for albendazole, 15% for mebendazole, and 31% for pyrantel pamoate. This substantiates prior claims that albendazole is much more effective than mebendazole for hookworm infections. Also of note is that the World Health Organization does recommend anthelmintic treatment in pregnant women after the first trimester. It is also recommended that if the patient also suffers from anemia that ferrous sulfate (200\u00a0mg) be administered three times daily at the same time as anthelmintic treatment; this should be continued until hemoglobin values return to normal which could take up to 3 months.\nHookworm infection can be treated with local cryotherapy when the hookworm is still in the skin.\nAlbendazole is effective both in the intestinal stage and during the stage the parasite is still migrating under the skin.\nIn case of anemia, iron supplementation can cause relief symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. However, as red blood cell levels are restored, shortage of other essentials such as folic acid or vitamin B12 may develop, so these might also be supplemented.\nDuring the 1910s, common treatments for hookworm included thymol, 2-naphthol, chloroform, gasoline, and eucalyptus oil. By the 1940s, the treatment of choice used tetrachloroethylene, given as 3 to 4 cc in the fasting state, followed by 30 to 45 g of sodium sulfate. Tetrachloroethylene was reported to have a cure rate of 80 percent for Necator infections, but 25 percent in Ancylostoma infections, and often produced mild intoxication in the patient.\nReinfection and drug resistance.\nOther important issues related to the treatment of hookworm are reinfection and drug resistance. It has been shown that reinfection after treatment can be extremely high. Some studies even show that 80% of pretreatment hookworm infection rates can be seen in treated communities within 30\u201336 months. While reinfection may occur, it is still recommended that regular treatments be conducted as it will minimize the occurrence of chronic outcomes. There are also increasing concerns about the issue of drug resistance. Drug resistance has appeared in front-line anthelmintics used for livestock nematodes. Generally human nematodes are less likely to develop resistance due to longer reproducing times, less frequent treatment, and more targeted treatment. Nonetheless, the global community must be careful to maintain the effectiveness of current anthelmintic as no new anthelmintic drugs are in the late-stage development.\nEpidemiology.\nIt is estimated that between 576 and 740 million individuals are infected with hookworm. Of these infected individuals, about 80 million are severely affected. The major cause of hookworm infection is \"N. americanus\" which is found in the Americas, sub-Saharan Africa, and Asia. \"A. duodenale\" is found in more scattered focal environments, namely Europe and the Mediterranean. Most infected individuals are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia/the Pacific Islands with each region having estimates of 198 million and 149 million infected individuals, respectively. Other affected regions include: South Asia (50 million), Latin America and the Caribbean (50 million), South Asia (59 million), Middle East/North Africa (10 million). A majority of these infected individuals live in poverty-stricken areas with poor sanitation. Hookworm infection is most concentrated among the world's poorest who live on less than $2 a day.\nWhile hookworm infection may not directly lead to mortality, its effects on morbidity demand immediate attention. When considering disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), neglected tropical diseases, including hookworm infection, rank among diarrheal diseases, ischemic heart disease, malaria, and tuberculosis as one of the most important health problems of the developing world.\nIt has been estimated that as many as 22.1 million DALYs have been lost due to hookworm infection. Recently, there has been increasing interest to address the public health concerns associated with hookworm infection. For example, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation recently donated US$34 million to fight Neglected Tropical Diseases including hookworm infection. Former US President Clinton also announced a mega-commitment at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) 2008 Annual Meeting to de-worm 10 million children.\nMany of the numbers regarding the prevalence of hookworm infection are estimates as there is no international surveillance mechanism currently in place to determine prevalence and global distribution. Some prevalence rates have been measured through survey data in endemic regions around the world. The following are some of the most recent findings on prevalence rates in regions endemic with hookworm.\nDarjeeling, Hooghly District, West Bengal, India (Pal \"et al.\" 2007)\nXiulongkan Village, Hainan Province, China (Gandhi \"et al.\" 2001)\nH\u00f2a B\u00ecnh, Northwest Vietnam (Verle \"et al.\" 2003)\nMinas Gerais, Brazil (Fleming \"et al.\" 2006)\nKwaZulu-Natal, South Africa (Mabaso \"et al.\" 2004)\nLowndes County, Alabama, United States \nThere have also been technological developments that may facilitate more accurate mapping of hookworm prevalence. Some researchers have begun to use geographical information systems (GIS) and remote sensing (RS) to examine helminth ecology and epidemiology. Brooker \"et al.\" utilized this technology to create helminth distribution maps of sub-Saharan Africa. By relating satellite derived environmental data with prevalence data from school-based surveys, they were able to create detailed prevalence maps. The study focused on a wide range of helminths, but interesting conclusions about hookworm specifically were found. As compared to other helminths, hookworm is able to survive in much hotter conditions and was highly prevalent throughout the upper end of the thermal range.\nImproved molecular diagnostic tools are another technological advancement that could help improve existing prevalence statistics. Recent research has focused on the development of a DNA-based tool that can be used for diagnosis of infection, specific identification of hookworm, and analysis of genetic variability in hookworm populations. Again this can serve as a major tool for different public health measures against hookworm infection. Most research regarding diagnostic tools is now focused on the creation of a rapid and cost-effective assay for the specific diagnosis of hookworm infection. Many are hopeful that its development can be achieved within the next five years.\nHistory.\nDiscovery.\nThe symptoms now attributed to hookworm appear in papyrus papers of ancient Egypt (c. 1500 BC), described as a derangement characterized by anemia. Avicenna, a Persian physician of the eleventh century, discovered the worm in several of his patients and related it to their disease. In later times, the condition was noticeably prevalent in the mining industry in England, France, Germany, Belgium, North Queensland, and elsewhere.\nItalian physician Angelo Dubini was the modern-day discoverer of the worm in 1838 after an autopsy of a peasant woman. Dubini published details in 1843 and identified the species as \"A. duodenale\". Working in the Egyptian medical system in 1852 German physician Theodor Bilharz, drawing upon the work of colleague Wilhelm Griesinger, found these worms during autopsies and went a step further in linking them to local endemic occurrences of chlorosis, which would probably be called iron deficiency anemia today.\nA breakthrough came 25 years later following a diarrhea and anemia epidemic that took place among Italian workmen employed on the Gotthard Rail Tunnel. In an 1880 paper, physicians Camillo Bozzolo, Edoardo Perroncito, and Luigi Pagliani correctly hypothesized that hookworm was linked to the fact that workers had to defecate inside the 15\u00a0km tunnel, and that many wore worn-out shoes. The work environment often contained standing water, sometimes knee-deep, and the larvae were capable of surviving several weeks in the water, allowing them to infect many of the workers. In 1897, it was established that the skin was the principal avenue of infection and the biological life cycle of the hookworm was clarified.\nEradication programmes.\nIn 1899, American zoologist Charles Wardell Stiles identified progressive pernicious anemia seen in the southern United States as being caused by the hookworm \"A. duodenale\". Testing in the 1900s revealed very heavy infestations in school-age children. In Puerto Rico, Dr. Bailey K. Ashford, a US Army physician, organized and conducted a parasite treatment campaign, which cured approximately 300,000 people (one-third of the Puerto Rican population) and reduced the death rate from this anemia by 90 percent during the years 1903\u201304.\nOn October 26, 1909 the Rockefeller Sanitary Commission for the Eradication of Hookworm Disease was organized as a result of a gift of US$1 million from John D. Rockefeller, Sr. The five-year program was a remarkable success and a great contribution to the United States' public health, instilling public education, medication, field work and modern government health departments in eleven southern states.\nThe hookworm exhibit was a prominent part of the 1910 Mississippi state fair.\nThe commission found that an average of 40% of school-aged children were infected with hookworm. Areas with higher levels of hookworm infection prior to the eradication program experienced greater increases in school enrollment, attendance, and literacy after the intervention. Econometric studies have shown that this effect cannot be explained by a variety of alternative factors, including differential trends across areas, changing crop prices, shifts in certain educational and health policies and the effect of malaria eradication. No significant contemporaneous results were found for adults who should have benefited less from the intervention owing to their substantially lower (prior) infection rates. The program nearly eradicated hookworm and would flourish afterward with new funding as the Rockefeller Foundation International Health Division.\nThe RF's hookworm campaign in Mexico showed how science and politics play a role in developing health policies. It brought together government officials, health officials, public health workers, Rockefeller officials and the community. This campaign was launched to eradicate hookworms in Mexico. Although the campaign did not focus on long-term treatments, it did set the terms of the relationship between Mexico and the Rockefeller Foundation. The scientific knowledge behind this campaign helped shape public health policies, improved public health and built a strong relationship between US and Mexico.\nIn the 1920s, hookworm eradication reached the Caribbean and Latin America, where great mortality was reported among people in the West Indies towards the end of the 18th century, as well as through descriptions sent from Brazil and various other tropical and sub-tropical regions.\nTreatments.\nTreatment in the early 20th century relied on the use of Epsom salt to reduce protective mucus, followed by thymol to kill the worms. By the 1940s, tetrachloroethylene was the leading method. It was not until later in the mid-20th century when new organic drug compounds were developed.\nResearch.\nAnemia in pregnancy.\nIt is estimated that a third of all pregnant women in developing countries are infected with hookworm, 56% of all pregnant women in developing countries suffer from anemia, 20% of all maternal deaths are either directly or indirectly related to anemia. Numbers like this have led to an increased interest in the topic of hookworm-related anemia during pregnancy. With the understanding that chronic hookworm infection can often lead to anemia, many people are now questioning if the treatment of hookworm could effect change in severe anemia rates and thus also on maternal and child health as well. Most evidence suggests that the contribution of hookworm to maternal anemia merits that all women of child-bearing age living in endemic areas be subject to periodic anthelmintic treatment. The World Health Organization even recommends that infected pregnant women be treated after their first trimester. Regardless of these suggestions, only Madagascar, Nepal and Sri Lanka have added deworming to their antenatal care programs.\nThis lack of deworming of pregnant women is explained by the fact that most individuals still fear that anthelmintic treatment will result in adverse birth outcomes. But a 2006 study by Gyorkos et al. found that when comparing a group of pregnant women treated with mebendazole with a control placebo group, both illustrated rather similar rates in adverse birth outcomes. The treated group demonstrated 5.6% adverse birth outcomes, while the control group had 6.25% adverse birth outcomes. Furthermore, Larocque et al. illustrated that treatment for hookworm infection actually led to positive health results in the infant. This study concluded that treatment with mebendazole plus iron supplements during antenatal care significantly reduced the proportion of very low birth weight infants when compared to a placebo control group. Studies so far have validated recommendations to treat infected pregnant women for hookworm infection during pregnancy.\nA review found that a single dose of antihelminthics (anti-worm drugs) given in the second trimester of pregnancy \"may reduce maternal anaemia and worm prevalence when used in settings with high prevalence of maternal helminthiasis\".\nMalaria co-infection.\nCo-infection with hookworm and \"Plasmodium falciparum\" is common in Africa. Although exact numbers are unknown, preliminary analyses estimate that as many as a quarter of African schoolchildren (17.8\u201332.1 million children aged 5\u201314 years) may be coincidentally at-risk of both \"P. falciparum\" and hookworm. While original hypotheses stated that co-infection with multiple parasites would impair the host's immune response to a single parasite and increase susceptibility to clinical disease, studies have yielded contrasting results. For example, one study in Senegal showed that the risk of clinical malaria infection was increased in helminth-infected children in comparison to helminth-free children while other studies have failed to reproduce such results, and even among laboratory mouse experiments the effect of helminths on malaria is variable.\nSome hypotheses and studies suggest that helminth infections may protect against cerebral malaria due to the possible modulation of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines responses. Furthermore, the mechanisms underlying this supposed increased susceptibility to disease are unknown. For example, helminth infections cause potent and highly polarized immune response characterized by increased T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine and Immunoglobulin E(IgE) production. However, the effect of such responses on the human immune response is unknown. Additionally, both malaria and helminth infection can cause anemia, but the effect of co-infection and possible enhancement of anemia is poorly understood.\nHygiene hypothesis and hookworm as therapy.\nThe hygiene hypothesis states that infants and children who lack exposure to infectious agents are more susceptible to allergic diseases via modulation of immune system development. The theory was first proposed by David P. Strachan who noted that hay fever and eczema were less common in children who belonged to large families. Since then, studies have noted the effect of gastrointestinal worms on the development of allergies in the developing world. For example, a study in Gambia found that eradication of worms in some villages led to increased skin reactions to allergies among children.\nVaccines.\nWhile annual or semi-annual mass antihelminthic administration is a critical aspect of any public health intervention, many have begun to realize how unsustainable it is due to aspects such as poverty, high rates of re-infection, and diminished efficacy of drugs with repeated use. Current research, therefore, has focused on the development of a vaccine that could be integrated into existing control programs. The goal of vaccine development is not necessarily to create a vaccine with sterilizing immunity or complete protection against immunity. A vaccine that reduces the likelihood of vaccinated individuals developing severe infections and thus reduced blood and nutrient levels could still have a significant impact on the high burden of disease throughout the world.\nCurrent research focuses on targeting two stages in the development of the worm: the larval stage and the adult stage. Research on larval antigens has focused on proteins that are members of the pathogenesis-related protein superfamily, \"Ancylostoma\" Secreted Proteins. Although they were first described in \"Anyclostoma\", these proteins have also been successfully isolated from the secreted product of \"N. americanus\". \"N. americanus\" ASP-2 (Na-ASP-2) is currently the leading larval-stage hookworm vaccine candidate. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has already been performed; 36 healthy adults without a history of hookworm infection were given three intramuscular injections of three different concentrations of Na-ASP-2 and observed for six months after the final vaccination. The vaccine induced significant anti-Na-ASP-2 IgG and cellular immune responses. In addition, it was safe and produced no debilitating side effects. The vaccine is now in a phase one trial; healthy adult volunteers with documented evidence of previous infection in Brazil are being given the same dose concentration on the same schedule used in the initial study. If this study is successful, the next step would be to conduct a phase two trial to assess the rate and intensity of hookworm infection among vaccinated persons. Because the Na-ASP-2 vaccine only targets the larval stage, it is critical that all subjects enrolled in the study be treated with antihelminthic drugs to eliminate adult worms prior to vaccination.\nAdult hookworm antigens have also been identified as potential candidates for vaccines. When adult worms attach to the intestinal mucosa of the human host, erythrocytes are ruptured in the worm's digestive tract which causes the release of free hemoglobin which is subsequently degraded by a proteolytic cascade. Several of these proteins that are responsible for this proteolytic cascade are also essential for the worm's nutrition and survival. Therefore, a vaccine that could induce antibodies for these antigens could interfere with the hookworm's digestive pathway and impair the worm's survival. Three proteins have been identified: the aspartic protease-hemoglobinase APR-1, the cysteine protease-hemoglobinase CP-2, and a glutathione S-transferase.\n Vaccination with APR-1 and CP-2 led to reduced host blood loss and fecal egg counts in dogs. With APR-1, vaccination even led to reduced worm burden. Research is currently stymied at the development of at least one of these antigens as a recombinant protein for testing in clinical trials.\nTerminology.\nThe term \"hookworm\" is sometimes used to refer to hookworm infection. A hookworm is a type of parasitic worm (helminth)."}
{"title": "Schizoaffective_disorder", "label": "Disease", "text": "Schizoaffective disorder (SZA, SZD or SAD) is a mental disorder characterized by abnormal thought processes and an unstable mood. The diagnosis is made when the person has symptoms of both schizophrenia (usually psychosis) and a mood disorder\u2014either bipolar disorder or depression. The main criterion for a diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is the presence of psychotic symptoms for at least two weeks without any mood symptoms present. Schizoaffective disorder can often be misdiagnosed when the correct diagnosis may be psychotic depression, psychotic bipolar disorder, schizophreniform disorder, or schizophrenia. It is imperative for providers to accurately diagnose patients, as treatment and prognosis differ greatly for each of these diagnoses.\nThere are two types of schizoaffective disorder: the bipolar type, which is distinguished by symptoms of mania, hypomania, or mixed episode; and the depressive type, which is distinguished by symptoms of depression only. Common symptoms of the disorder include hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and thinking. Auditory hallucinations, or \"hearing voices\", are most common. The onset of symptoms usually begins in young adulthood. On a ranking scale of symptom progression of mental health issues relating to the schizophrenic spectrum, a mood disorder would be the first diagnosis; as symptoms progress it would then be diagnosed as schizoaffective disorder, and if symptoms progress even more it would then be diagnosed as schizophrenia, with other disorders included on the ranking as well depending on symptoms. A mood disorder would be the less severe diagnoses, while schizophrenia would be the more severe diagnosis with schizoaffective disorder being a bridge between the two disorders. Schizoaffective disorder and other disorders on the schizophrenic spectrum are evaluated as a psychotic disorder in the DSM-V, so the line between psychotic or not psychotic begins at a mood disorder, as being considered not psychotic, and schizoaffective disorder along with other disorders of the schizophrenia spectrum, as being considered psychotic. A mood disorder is not in the schizophrenic spectrum.\nGenetics (researched in the field of genomics); problems with neural circuits; chronic early, and chronic or short-term current environmental stress appear to be important causal factors. No single isolated organic cause has been found, but extensive evidence exists for abnormalities in the metabolism of tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), dopamine, and glutamic acid in people with schizophrenia, psychotic mood disorders, and schizoaffective disorder. People with schizoaffective disorder are likely to have co-occurring conditions, including anxiety disorders and substance use disorders.\nThe mainstay of current treatment is antipsychotic medication combined with mood stabilizer medication or antidepressant medication, or both. There is growing concern by some researchers that antidepressants may increase psychosis, mania, and long-term mood episode cycling in the disorder. When there is risk to self or others, usually early in treatment, hospitalization may be necessary. Psychiatric rehabilitation, psychotherapy, and vocational rehabilitation are very important for recovery of higher psychosocial function. As a group, people with schizoaffective disorder that were diagnosed using DSM-IV and ICD-10 criteria (which have since been updated) have a better outcome, but have variable individual psychosocial functional outcomes compared to people with mood disorders, from worse to the same. Outcomes for people with DSM-5 diagnosed schizoaffective disorder depend on data from prospective cohort studies, which have not been completed yet. The DSM-5 diagnosis was updated because DSM-IV criteria resulted in overuse of the diagnosis; that is, DSM-IV criteria led to many patients being misdiagnosed with the disorder. DSM-IV prevalence estimates were less than one percent of the population, in the range of 0.5\u20130.8 percent; newer DSM-5 prevalence estimates are not yet available.\nSigns and symptoms.\nSchizoaffective disorder is defined by \"mood disorder-free psychosis\" in the context of a long-term psychotic and mood disorder. Psychosis must meet criterion A for schizophrenia which may include delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking and speech or behavior and negative symptoms. Both delusions and hallucinations are classic symptoms of psychosis. Delusions are false beliefs which are strongly held despite evidence to the contrary. Beliefs should not be considered delusional if they are in keeping with cultural beliefs. Delusional beliefs may or may not reflect mood symptoms (for example, someone experiencing depression may or may not experience delusions of guilt). Hallucinations are disturbances in perception involving any of the five senses, although auditory hallucinations (or \"hearing voices\") are the most common. Negative symptoms include alogia (lack of speech), blunted affect (reduced intensity of outward emotional expression), avolition (lack of motivation), and anhedonia (inability to experience pleasure). Negative symptoms can be more lasting and more debilitating than positive symptoms of psychosis.\nMood symptoms are of mania, hypomania, mixed episode, or depression, and tend to be episodic rather than continuous. A mixed episode represents a combination of symptoms of mania and depression at the same time. Symptoms of mania include elevated or irritable mood, grandiosity (inflated self-esteem), agitation, risk-taking behavior, decreased need for sleep, poor concentration, rapid speech, and racing thoughts. Symptoms of depression include low mood, apathy, changes in appetite or weight, disturbances in sleep, changes in motor activity, fatigue, guilt or feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thinking.\nDSM-5 states that if a patient only experiences psychotic symptoms during a mood episode, their diagnosis is Mood Disorder with Psychotic Features and not Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder. If the patient experiences psychotic symptoms without mood symptoms for longer than a two-week period, their diagnosis is either Schizophrenia or Schizoaffective Disorder. If mood disorder episodes are present for the majority and residual course of the illness and up until the diagnosis, the patient can be diagnosed with Schizoaffective Disorder.\nCauses.\nA combination of genetic and environmental factors are believed to play a role in the development of schizoaffective disorder.\nViewed broadly then, biological and environmental factors interact with a person's genes in ways which may increase or decrease the risk for developing schizoaffective disorder; exactly how this happens (the biological mechanism) is not yet known. Schizophrenia spectrum disorders, of which schizoaffective disorder is a part, have been increasingly linked to advanced paternal age at the time of conception, a known cause of genetic mutations. The physiology of people diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder appears to be similar, but not identical, to that of those diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder; however, human neurophysiological function in normal brain and mental disorder syndromes is not fully understood.\nSubstance use disorder.\nA clear causal connection between substance use and psychotic spectrum disorders, including schizoaffective disorder, has been difficult to prove. In the specific case of cannabis (marijuana), however, evidence supports a link between earlier onset of psychotic illness and cannabis use. The more often cannabis is used, particularly in early adolescence, the more likely a person is to develop a psychotic illness, with frequent use being correlated with double the risk of psychosis and schizoaffective disorder. A 2009 Yale review stated that in individuals with an established psychotic disorder, cannabinoids can exacerbate symptoms, trigger relapse, and have negative consequences on the course of the illness. While cannabis use is accepted as a contributory cause of schizoaffective disorder by many, it remains controversial, since not all young people who use cannabis later develop psychosis, but those who do use cannabis have an increased odds ratio of about 3. Certain drugs can imitate symptoms of schizophrenia (which we know has similar symptoms to schizoaffective disorder). This is important to note when including that substance-induced psychosis should be ruled out when diagnosing patients so that patients are not misdiagnosed.\nDiagnosis.\nPsychosis as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder is first and foremost a diagnosis of exclusion. So a new-onset episode of psychosis \"cannot\" be considered to be a symptom of a psychiatric disorder until other relevant and known medical causes of psychosis are excluded, or ruled out. Many clinicians improperly perform, or entirely miss this step, introducing avoidable diagnostic error and misdiagnosis.\nAn initial assessment includes a comprehensive history and physical examination. Although no biological laboratory tests exist which confirm schizoaffective disorder, biological tests should be performed to exclude psychosis associated with or caused by substance use, medications, toxins or poisons, surgical complications, or other medical illnesses. Since non-medical mental health practitioners are not trained to exclude medical causes of psychosis, people experiencing psychosis should be referred to an emergency department or hospital.\nDelirium should be ruled out, which can be distinguished by visual hallucinations, acute onset and fluctuating level of consciousness, indicating other underlying factors which includes medical illnesses. Excluding medical illnesses associated with psychosis is performed by using blood tests to measure:\nOther investigations which may be performed include:\nBlood tests are not usually repeated for relapse in people with an established diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder, unless there is a specific \"medical\" indication. These may include serum BSL if olanzapine has previously been prescribed, thyroid function if lithium has previously been taken to rule out hypothyroidism, liver function tests if chlorpromazine has been prescribed, CPK levels to exclude neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and a urinalysis and serum toxicology screening if substance use is suspected. Assessment and treatment may be done on an outpatient basis; admission to an inpatient facility is considered if there is a risk to self or others.\nBecause psychosis may be precipitated or exacerbated by common classes of psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants, ADHD stimulant medications, and sleep medications, prescribed medication-induced psychosis should be ruled out, particularly for first-episode psychosis. This is an essential step to reduce diagnostic error and to evaluate potential medication sources of further patient harm. Regarding prescribed medication sources of patient harm, Yale School of Medicine Professor of Psychiatry Malcolm B. Bowers, Jr, MD wrote:\nIllicit drugs aren't the only ones that precipitate psychosis or mania\u2014prescribed drugs can too, and in particular, some psychiatric drugs. We investigated this and found that about 1 in 12 psychotic or manic patients in an inpatient psychiatric facility are there due to antidepressant-induced psychosis or mania. That's unfortunate for the field [of psychiatry] and disastrous for some of our patients.\nSubstance-induced psychosis should also be ruled out. Both substance- and medication-induced psychosis can be excluded to a high level of certainty while the person is psychotic, typically in an emergency department, using both a\nSome dietary supplements may also induce psychosis or mania, but cannot be ruled out with laboratory tests. So a psychotic person's family, partner, or friends should be asked whether he or she is currently taking any dietary supplements.\nCommon mistakes made when diagnosing psychotic patients include:\nOnly after these relevant and known causes of psychosis have been ruled out can a psychiatric differential diagnosis be made. A mental health clinician will incorporate family history, observation of a psychotic person's behavior while the person is experiencing active symptoms, to begin a psychiatric differential diagnosis. Diagnosis also includes self-reported experiences, as well as behavioral abnormalities reported by family members, friends, or significant others. Mistakes in this stage include:\nDSM-5 criteria.\nThe most widely used criteria for diagnosing schizoaffective disorder are from the American Psychiatric Association's \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5\".\nThe DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder definition was plagued by problems of being inconsistently (or unreliably) used on patients; when the diagnosis is made, it does not stay with most patients over time, and it has questionable diagnostic validity (that is, it does not describe a distinct disorder, nor predict any particular outcome). These problems have been slightly reduced (or \"modestly improved\") in the DSM-5 according to Carpenter.\nWhen psychotic symptoms are confined to an episode of mania or depression (with or without mixed features), the diagnosis is that of a \u201cpsychotic\u201d mood disorder, namely either psychotic bipolar disorder or psychotic major depression. Only when psychotic states persist in a sustained fashion for two weeks or longer without concurrent affective symptoms is the diagnosis schizoaffective disorder, schizophreniform disorder or schizophrenia.\nThe second cardinal guideline in the DSM-5 diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder is one of timeframe.\nDSM-5 requires two episodes of psychosis (whereas DSM-IV needed only one) to qualify for the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis. As such, it is no longer an \"episode diagnosis.\" The new schizoaffective framework looks at the time from \"the [first episode of] psychosis up to the current episode [of psychosis], rather than only defining a single episode with [co-occurring] psychotic and mood syndromes.\" Specifically, one of the episodes of psychosis must last a minimum of two weeks without mood disorder symptoms, but the person may be mildly to moderately depressed while psychotic. The other period of psychosis \"requires the overlap of mood [disorder] symptoms with psychotic symptoms to be conspicuous\" and last for a greater portion of the disorder.\nThese two changes are intended by the DSM-5 workgroup to accomplish two goals:\nIf the schizoaffective diagnosis is used less often, other diagnoses (like psychotic mood disorders and schizophrenia) are likely to be used more often; but this is hypothetical until real-world data arrive. Validity problems with the diagnosis remain and await further work in the fields of psychiatric genetics, neuroimaging, and cognitive science that includes the overlapping fields of cognitive, affective, and social neuroscience, which may change the way schizoaffective disorder is conceptualized and defined in future versions of the DSM and ICD.\nTypes.\nOne of two types of schizoaffective disorder may be noted in a diagnosis based on the mood component of the disorder:\nProblems with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder.\nThe American Psychiatric Association's DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder persisted for 19 years (1994\u20132013). Clinicians adequately trained in diagnosis used the schizoaffective diagnosis too often, largely because the criteria were poorly defined, ambiguous, and hard to use (or poorly operationalized). Poorly trained clinicians used the diagnosis without making necessary exclusions of common causes of psychosis, including some prescribed psychiatric medications. Specialty books written by experts on schizoaffective disorder have existed for over eight years before DSM-5 describing the overuse of the diagnosis.\nCarpenter and the DSM-5 schizoaffective disorders workgroup analyzed data made available to them in 2009, and reported in May 2013 that:\na recent review of psychotic disorders from large private insurance and Medicare databases in the U.S. found that the diagnosis of DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was used for about a third of cases with non-affective psychotic disorders. Hence, this unreliable and poorly defined diagnosis is clearly overused.\nAs stated above, the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder diagnosis is very inconsistently used or unreliable. A diagnosis is unreliable when several different mental health professionals observing the same individual make different diagnoses excessively. Even when a structured DSM-IV diagnostic interview and best estimate procedures were made by experts in the field that included information from family informants and prior clinical records, reliability was still poor for the DSM-IV schizoaffective diagnosis.\nThe DSM-IV schizoaffective diagnosis is not stable over time either. An initial diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder during time spent at a psychiatric inpatient facility was stable at 6-month and 24-month follow ups for only 36% of patients. By comparison, diagnostic stability was 92% for schizophrenia, 83% for bipolar disorder and 74% for major depression. Most patients diagnosed with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder are later diagnosed with a different disorder, and that disorder is more stable over time than the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder diagnosis.\nIn April 2009, Carpenter and the DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup reported that they were \"developing new criteria for schizoaffective disorder to improve reliability and face validity,\" and were \"determining whether the dimensional assessment of mood [would] justify a recommendation to drop schizoaffective disorder as a diagnostic category.\" Speaking to an audience at the May 2009 annual conference of the American Psychiatric Association, Carpenter said:\nWe had hoped to get rid of schizoaffective [disorder] as a diagnostic category [in the DSM-5] because we don't think it's [a] valid [scientific entity] and we don't think it's reliable. On the other hand, we think it's absolutely indispensable to clinical practice.\nA major reason why DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was indispensable to clinical practice is because it offered clinicians a diagnosis for patients with psychosis in the context of mood disorder whose clinical picture, at the time diagnosed, appeared different from DSM-IV \"schizophrenia\" or \"mood disorder with psychotic features\".\nBut DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder carries an unnecessarily worse prognosis than a \"mood disorder with psychotic features\" diagnosis, because long-term data revealed that a significant proportion of DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder patients had 15-year outcomes indistinguishable from patients with mood disorders with or without psychotic features, even though the clinical picture at the time of first diagnosis looked different from both schizophrenia and mood disorders.\nThese problems with the DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder definition result in most people the diagnosis is used on being misdiagnosed; furthermore, outcome studies done 10 years after the diagnosis was released showed that the group of patients defined by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 schizoaffective diagnosis had significantly better outcomes than predicted, so the diagnosis carries a misleading and unnecessarily poor prognosis. The DSM-IV criteria for schizoaffective disorder will continue to be used on U.S. board examinations in psychiatry through the end of 2014; established practitioners may continue to use the problematic DSM-IV definition much further into the future also.\nDSM-5 research directions.\nThe new schizoaffective disorder criteria continue to have questionable diagnostic validity. Questionable diagnostic validity does not doubt that people with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder need treatment\u2014psychosis and mood disorder must be treated. Instead, questionable diagnostic validity means there are unresolved problems with the way the DSM-5 categorizes and defines schizoaffective disorder.\nA core concept in modern psychiatry since DSM-III was released in 1980, is the categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia, known as the Kraepelinian dichotomy. Emil Kraepelin introduced the idea that schizophrenia was separate from mood disorders after observing patients with symptoms of psychosis and mood disorder, over a century ago, in 1898. This was a time before genetics were known and before any treatments existed for mental illness. The Kraepelinian dichotomy was not used for DSM-I and DSM-II because both manuals were influenced by the dominant psychodynamic psychiatry of the time, but the designers of DSM-III wanted to use more scientific and biological definitions. Consequently, they looked to psychiatry's history and decided to use the Kraepelinian dichotomy as a foundation for the classification system.\nThe Kraepelinian dichotomy continues to be used in DSM-5 despite having been challenged by data from modern psychiatric genetics for over eight years, and there is now evidence of a significant overlap in the genetics of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. According to this genetic evidence, the Kraepelinian categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia at the foundation of the current classification and diagnostic system is a mistaken false dichotomy.\nThe dichotomy at the foundation of the current system forms the basis for a convoluted schizoaffective disorder definition in DSM-IV that resulted in excessive misdiagnosis. Real life schizoaffective disorder patients have significant and enduring symptoms that bridge what are incorrectly assumed to be categorically separate disorders, schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. People with psychotic depression, bipolar disorder with a history of psychosis, and schizophrenia with mood symptoms also have symptoms that bridge psychosis and mood disorders. The categorical diagnostic manuals do not reflect reality in their separation of psychosis (via the schizophrenia diagnosis) from mood disorder, nor do they currently emphasize the actual overlap found in real-life patients. Thus, they are likely to continue to introduce either-or conceptual and diagnostic error, by way of confirmation bias into clinicians' mindsets, hindering accurate assessment and treatment.\nThe new definition continues the lack of parsimony of the old definition. Simpler, clearer, and more usable definitions of the diagnosis were supported by certain members of the DSM-5 workgroup (see next paragraph); these were debated but deemed premature, because more \"research [is] needed to establish a new classification system of equal or greater validity\" to the existing system. Because of DSM-5's continuing problematic categorical foundation, schizoaffective disorder's conceptual and diagnostic validity remains doubtful. After enough research is completed and data exists, future diagnostic advances will need to either eliminate and replace, or soften and bridge, the hard categorical separation of mood disorders from schizophrenia; most likely using a spectrum or dimensional approach to diagnosis.\nMore parsimonious definitions than the current one were considered by Carpenter and the DSM-5 workgroup:\nOne option for the DSM-5 would have been to remove the schizoaffective disorder category and to add affective [or mood] symptoms [that is, mania, hypomania, mixed episode, or depression] as a dimension to schizophrenia and schizophreniform disorder \"or\" to define a single category for the co-occurrence of psychosis and mood symptoms. This option was extensively debated but ultimately deemed to be premature in the absence of sufficient clinical and theoretical validating data justifying such a \u2026 reconceptualization. Additionally, there appeared to be no practical way to introduce affect [or mood] dimensions covering the entire course of illness, that would capture the current concept of periods of psychosis related and unrelated to mood episodes.\nThe field of psychiatry has begun to question its assumptions and analyze its data in order to merge closer with evidence-based medicine. The removal of the \"episode diagnosis\", and the addition of two episodes of psychosis, as qualifications for the DSM-5 schizoaffective diagnosis, may improve the diagnosis' consistency over DSM-IV for research purposes, where diagnostic criteria are by necessity followed \"exactingly\". But the new definition remains long, unwieldy, and perhaps still not very useful for community clinicians\u2014with two psychoses, one for two weeks minimum and without mood disorder (but the person can be mildly or moderately depressed) and the other with significant mood disorder and psychosis lasting for most of the time, and with lasting mood symptoms for most of the residual portion of the illness. Community clinicians used the previous definition \"for about a third of cases with non-affective psychotic disorders.\" Non-affective psychotic disorders are, by definition, not schizoaffective disorder. For clinicians to make such sizeable errors of misdiagnosis may imply systemic problems with the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis itself. Already, at least one expert believes the new schizoaffective definition has not gone far enough to solve the previous definition's problems.\nFrom a scientific standpoint, modern clinical psychiatry is still a very young, underdeveloped medical specialty because its target organ, the human brain, is not yet well understood. The human brain's neural circuits, for example, are just beginning to be mapped by modern neuroscience in the Human Connectome Project and CLARITY. Clinical psychiatry, furthermore, has begun to understand and acknowledge its current limitations\u2014but further steps by the field are required to significantly reduce misdiagnosis and patient harm; this is crucial both for responsible patient care and to retain public trust. Looking forward, a paradigm shift is needed in psychiatric research to address unanswered questions about schizoaffective disorder. The dimensional Research Domain Criteria project currently being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Mental Health, may be the specific problem solving framework psychiatry needs to develop a more scientifically mature understanding of schizoaffective disorder as well as all other mental disorders.\nTreatment.\nThe primary treatment of schizoaffective disorder is medication, with improved outcomes using combined long-term psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization started in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common. Evidence indicates that regular exercise has a positive effect on the physical and mental health of those with schizoaffective disorder.\nParticipating in internet forums is sometimes used by people with schizoaffective disorder in addition to outpatient medication treatment.\nTherapy.\nSkillfully delivered psychosocial treatments are perhaps the most important component of pushing for and encouraging improved overall functioning in schizoaffective disorder. Supportive psychotherapy and cognitive behavioral therapy are both helpful. Intensive case management (ICM) has been shown to reduce hospitalizations, improve adherence to treatment, and improve social functioning. With ICM, clients are assigned a case manager responsible for coordination of care and assisting clients to access supports to address needs in multiple areas related to well-being, including housing.\nHigh quality psychosocial or psychiatric rehabilitation is very important for recovery from schizoaffective disorder. Psychiatric or psychosocial rehabilitation focuses on solving community integration problems such as obtaining and keeping housing and increasing involvement in positive social groups. It also focuses on improving and increasing activities of daily living; increasing daily healthy habits (such as normalizing sleep-wake cycles; increasing early morning natural light exposure; increasing moderate exercise [such as 2030 minutes of moderate to brisk early morning to pre-afternoon walking daily, in order to help normalize circadian rhythms]; helping individuals understand the specific benefits of healthy food choices; increasing stress-reduction activities such as yoga, tai chi, or meditation); and decreasing unhealthy behaviors (such as substance use and smoking); thereby significantly improving quality of life. High quality psychiatric rehabilitation may also focus on vocational rehabilitation including preparing the client for volunteer, part-time paid work, returning to school for further education, job skills training for full-time flexible or supported employment, and other client self-improvement efforts. Core principles of effective psychiatric rehabilitation must include providing \"hope\" when the client lacks it, \"respect for the client\" wherever they are in the recovery process, \"empowering\" the client, teaching the client \"wellness planning\", and emphasizing the importance for the client to develop \"social support networks\". A long-term goal of psychiatric and vocational rehabilitation is that the client learn and actively engage in active stress management while in education or employment, while receiving treatment.\nPsychiatric rehabilitation consists of eight main areas:\nMedication.\nAntipsychotic medication is usually required both for acute treatment and the prevention of relapse. There is no single antipsychotic of choice in treating schizoaffective disorder, but atypical antipsychotics should be considered because they have mood-stabilizing activity. Paliperidone is an antipsychotic with FDA approval for the treatment of schizoaffective disorder. Antipsychotics should be used at the minimum dose necessary to control symptoms. Potential side effects include extrapyramidal symptoms, including tremor, muscle stiffness, and restlessness or akathisia. Atypical antipsychotics carry a risk of metabolic syndrome, including weight gain, increased blood sugar, and increased blood cholesterol, so regular monitoring of weight and blood work should be carried out. Some atypical antipsychotics, such as ziprasidone and aripiprazole, are associated with less risk than others, such as olanzapine. Medication choice is based on how effectively it reduces symptoms, how few side effects it causes, and cost.\nIn people with treatment-refractory psychosis, a clozapine trial should be considered. Clozapine is an atypical antipsychotic that is recognized as being particularly effective when other antipsychotic agents have failed. Clozapine should also be considered in people with chronic and persistent suicidal thinking and behaviour, as it has been shown to reduce the risk of suicide in patients with schizoaffective disorder and a history of suicidality. Between 0.5 and 2% of patients taking clozapine may develop a life-threatening complication called agranulocytosis, which is a significant drop in a type of white blood cell. Because of this risk, people taking clozapine must have regular monitoring of blood cell counts.\nThe management of the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder is similar to the treatment of bipolar disorder, with the goal of preventing mood episodes and cycling. Lithium or anticonvulsant mood stabilizers such as valproic acid, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine are prescribed in combination with an antipsychotic.\nFor depression, if an antidepressant is prescribed, \"extra attentiveness must be given\" by the prescribing clinician due its risk for long-term mood cycle acceleration (that is, inducing more frequent episodes of depression per unit of time) and prescribed medication-induced psychosis or mania. For individuals who show emerging psychosis, mania, mixed episode symptoms, or mood cycle acceleration, switching to an antipsychotic plus lithium or lamotrigine is preferable to antidepressants.\nFor individuals who experience anxiety, anti-anxiety medications can be used, usually on a short-term basis. Benzodiazepines, including lorazepam, clonazepam and diazepam, are types of anti-anxiety medications. Care must be taken when prescribing benzodiazepines due to the risk of the person developing tolerance and dependence.\nElectroconvulsive therapy.\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for patients with schizoaffective disorder experiencing severe depression or severe psychotic symptoms that have not responded to treatment with antipsychotics.\nEpidemiology.\nSchizoaffective disorder is estimated to occur in 0.3 to 0.8 percent of people at some point in their life. 30% of cases occur between the ages of 25 and 35. It is more common in women than men; however, this is because of the high concentration of women in the depressive subcategory, whereas the bipolar subtype has a roughly even gender distribution.\nHistory.\nThe term \"schizoaffective psychosis\" was introduced by the American psychiatrist Jacob Kasanin in 1933 to describe an episodic psychotic illness with predominant affective symptoms, that was thought at the time to be a good-prognosis schizophrenia. Kasanin's concept of the illness was influenced by the psychoanalytic teachings of Adolf Meyer and Kasanin postulated that \"schizoaffective psychosis\" was caused by \"emotional conflicts\" of a \"mainly sexual nature\" and that psychoanalysis \"would help prevent the recurrence of such attacks.\" He based his description on a case study of nine individuals.\nOther psychiatrists, before and after Kasanin, have made scientific observations of schizoaffective disorder based on assumptions of a biological and genetic cause of the illness. In 1863, German psychiatrist Karl Kahlbaum (18281899) described schizoaffective disorders as a separate group in his \"vesania typica circularis\". Kahlbaum distinguished between cross-sectional and longitudinal observations. (\"Cross-sectional\" refers to observation of a single, specific episode of the illness, for example, one episode of psychotic depression; while \"longitudinal\" refers to long-term observation of many distinct episodes [similar or different] often occurring over the span of years.) In 1920, psychiatrist Emil Kraepelin (18561926), the founder of contemporary scientific psychiatry, observed a \"great number\" of cases that had characteristics of both groups of psychoses that he originally posited were two distinct and separate illnesses, \"dementia praecox\" (now called schizophrenia) and \"manic depressive insanity\" (now called bipolar disorders [plural since there are more than one type of bipolar disorder] and recurrent depression).\nKraepelin acknowledged that \"there are many overlaps in this area,\" that is, the area between schizophrenia and mood disorders. In 1959, psychiatrist Kurt Schneider (18871967) began to further refine conceptualizations of the different forms that schizoaffective disorders can take since he observed \"concurrent and sequential types\". (The \"concurrent type\" of illness he referred to is a longitudinal course of illness with episodes of mood disorder and psychosis occurring predominantly at the same time [now called psychotic mood disorders or affective psychosis]; while his \"sequential type\" refers to a longitudinal course predominantly marked by alternating mood and psychotic episodes.) Schneider described schizoaffective disorders as \"cases in-between\" the traditional Kraepelinian dichotomy of schizophrenia and mood disorders.\nThe historical clinical observation that schizoaffective disorder is an overlap of schizophrenia and mood disorders is explained by genes for both illnesses being present in individuals with schizoaffective disorder; specifically, recent research shows that schizophrenia and mood disorders share common genes \"and\" polygenic variations.\nSchizoaffective disorder was included as a subtype of schizophrenia in DSM-I and DSM-II, though research showed a schizophrenic cluster of symptoms in individuals with a family history of mood disorders whose illness course, other symptoms and treatment outcome were otherwise more akin to bipolar disorder than to schizophrenia. DSM-III placed schizoaffective disorder in \"Psychotic Disorders Not Otherwise Specified\" before being formally recognized in DSM-III-R. DSM-III-R included its own diagnostic criteria as well as the subtypes, bipolar and depressive. In DSM-IV, published in 1994, schizoaffective disorders belonged to the category \"Other Psychotic Disorders\" and included almost the same criteria and the same subtypes of illness as DSM-III-R, with the addition of mixed bipolar symptomatology.\nDSM-IV and DSM-IV-TR (published in 2000) criteria for schizoaffective disorder were poorly defined and poorly operationalized. These ambiguous and unreliable criteria lasted 19 years and led clinicians to significantly overuse the schizoaffective disorder diagnosis. Patients commonly diagnosed with DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder showed a clinical picture at time of diagnosis that appeared different from schizophrenia or psychotic mood disorders using DSM-IV criteria, but who as a group, were longitudinally determined to have outcomes indistinguishable from those with mood disorders with or without psychotic features. A poor prognosis was assumed to apply to these patients by most clinicians, and this poor prognosis was harmful to many patients. The poor prognosis for DSM-IV schizoaffective disorder was not based on patient outcomes research, but was caused by poorly defined criteria interacting with clinical tradition and belief; clinician enculturation with unscientific assumptions from the diagnosis' history (discussed above), including the invalid Kraepelinian dichotomy; and by clinicians being unfamiliar with the scientific limitations of the diagnostic and classification system.\nThe DSM-5 schizoaffective disorder workgroup analyzed all of the available research evidence on schizoaffective disorder, and concluded that \"presenting symptoms of psychosis have little validity in determining diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment response.\" Given our understanding of overlapping genetics in bipolar disorders, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia, as well as the overlap in treatments for these disorders; but given the lack of specificity of presenting symptoms for determining diagnosis, prognosis or treatment response in these psychotic illness syndromes, the limits of our knowledge are clearer: \"Presenting symptoms of psychosis describe only presenting symptoms to be treated, and not much more\". Schizoaffective disorder was changed to a longitudinal or life course diagnosis in DSM-5 for this reason.\nResearch.\nEvidence is lacking about schizoaffective disorder's (likely multiple) causes and mechanisms (knowing these leads to specific and consistently effective treatments), and about how exactly mood episodes and psychosis are related (knowing this may lead to a simpler, clearer, and more usable behavioral definition of the disorder; as well as a better diagnostic system). Whether schizoaffective disorder is a variant of schizophrenia (as in DSM-5 and ICD-10 classification systems), a variant of bipolar disorder, or part of a dimensional continuum between psychotic depression, bipolar disorders and schizophrenia is currently being investigated.\nResearch into the assessment and treatment of schizoaffective disorder will rely less on DSM and ICD criteria as time progresses, and more on the dimensional Research Domain Criteria currently being developed by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The Research Domain Criteria initiative, led by Bruce Cuthbert of NIMH, is the inspiration for the Roadmap for Mental Health Research in Europe (ROAMER). The purpose of the Research Domain Criteria initiative is to address the marked variability and overlap within and among the disorder categories, and to foster development of more effective assessment and treatment for each individual patient. Over the coming decades, advances resulting from the Research Domain Criteria in the U.S. and ROAMER in Europe will be incorporated into future versions of the DSM and ICD, with the hope of eventually leading to personalized mental health of greater diagnostic accuracy and with more targeted and useful treatments, including biomedical, psychosocial, and possibly preventive approaches."}
{"title": "Learning_disability", "label": "Disease", "text": "Learning disability, learning disorder, or learning difficulty (British English) is a condition in the brain that causes difficulties comprehending or processing information and can be caused by several different factors. Given the \"difficulty learning in a typical manner\", this does not exclude the ability to learn in a different manner. Therefore, some people can be more accurately described as having a \"learning difference\", thus avoiding any misconception of being disabled with a lack of ability to learn and possible negative stereotyping. In the United Kingdom, the term \"learning disability\" generally refers to an intellectual disability, while difficulties such as dyslexia and dyspraxia are usually referred to as \"learning difficulties\".\nWhile \"learning disability\" and \"learning disorder\" are often used interchangeably, they differ in many ways. Disorder refers to significant learning problems in an academic area. These problems, however, are not enough to warrant an official diagnosis. Learning disability, on the other hand, is an official clinical diagnosis, whereby the individual meets certain criteria, as determined by a professional (such as a psychologist, psychiatrist, speech language pathologist, or pediatrician). The difference is in degree, frequency, and intensity of reported symptoms and problems, and thus the two should not be confused. When the term \"learning disorder\" is used, it describes a group of disorders characterized by inadequate development of specific academic, language, and speech skills. Types of learning disorders include reading (dyslexia), arithmetic (dyscalculia) and writing (dysgraphia).\nThe unknown factor is the disorder that affects the brain's ability to receive and process information. This disorder can make it problematic for a person to learn as quickly or in the same way as someone who is not affected by a learning disability. People with a learning disability have trouble performing specific types of skills or completing tasks if left to figure things out by themselves or if taught in conventional ways.\nIndividuals with learning disabilities can face unique challenges that are often pervasive throughout the lifespan. Depending on the type and severity of the disability, interventions, and current technologies may be used to help the individual learn strategies that will foster future success. Some interventions can be quite simplistic, while others are intricate and complex. Current technologies may require student training to be effective classroom supports. Teachers, parents, and schools can create plans together that tailor intervention and accommodations to aid the individuals in successfully becoming independent learners. A multi-disciplinary team frequently helps to design the intervention and to coordinate the execution of the intervention with teachers and parents. This team frequently includes school psychologists, special educators, speech therapists (pathologists), occupational therapists, psychologists, ESL teachers, literacy coaches, and/or reading specialists. \nDefinition.\nRepresentatives of organizations committed to the education and welfare of individuals with learning disabilities are known as National Joint Committee on Learning Disabilities (NJCLD). The NJCLD used the term 'learning disability' to indicate a discrepancy between a child's apparent capacity to learn and their level of achievement. Several difficulties existed, however, with the NJCLD standard of defining learning disability. One such difficulty was its belief of central nervous system dysfunction as a basis of understanding and diagnosing learning disability. This conflicted with the fact that many individuals who experienced central nervous system dysfunction, such as those with cerebral palsy, did not experience disabilities in learning. On the other hand, those individuals who experienced multiple handicapping conditions along with learning disability frequently received inappropriate assessment, planning, and instruction. The NJCLD notes that it is possible for learning disability to occur simultaneously with other handicapping conditions, however, the two should not be directly linked together or confused.\nIn the 1980s, NJCLD, therefore, defined the term learning disability as: a heterogeneous group of disorders manifested by significant difficulties in the acquisition and use of listening, speaking, reading, writing, reasoning or mathematical abilities. These disorders are intrinsic to the individual and presumed to be due to Central Nervous System Dysfunction. Even though a learning disability may occur concomitantly with other handicapping conditions (e.g. sensory impairment, intellectual disability, social and emotional disturbance) or environmental influences (e.g. cultural differences, insufficient/inappropriate instruction, psychogenic factors) it is not the direct result of those conditions or influences.\nThe 2002 LD Roundtable produced the following definition:Concept of LD: Strong converging evidence supports the validity of the concept of specific learning disabilities (SLD). This evidence is particularly impressive because it converges across different indicators and methodologies. The central concept of SLD involves disorders of learning and cognition that are intrinsic to the individual. SLD are specific in the sense that these disorders each significantly affect a relatively narrow range of academic and performance outcomes. SLD may occur in combination with other disabling conditions, but they are not due primarily to other conditions, such as intellectual disability, behavioral disturbance, lack of opportunities to learn, or primary sensory deficits.The issue of defining learning disabilities has generated significant and ongoing controversy. The term \"learning disability\" does not exist in DSM-IV, but it has been added to the DSM-5. The DSM-5 does not limit learning disorders to a particular diagnosis such as reading, mathematics, or written expression. Instead, it is a single diagnosis criterion describing drawbacks in general academic skills and includes detailed specifiers for the areas of reading, mathematics, and written expression.\nUnited States and Canada.\nIn the United States and Canada, the terms learning disability and learning disorder (LD) refer to a group of disorders that affect a broad range of academic and functional skills including the ability to speak, listen, read, write, spell, reason, organize information, and do math. People with learning disabilities generally have intelligence that is average or higher.\nLegislation in the United States.\nThe Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act 1973, effective May 1977, guarantees certain rights to people with disabilities, especially in the cases of education and work, such being in schools, colleges and university settings.\nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, formerly known as the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, is a United States federal law that governs how states and public agencies provide early intervention, special education and related services to children with disabilities. It addresses the educational needs of children with disabilities from birth to the age of 21. Considered as a civil rights law, states are not required to participate.\nCanada.\nIn Canada, the first association in support of children with learning disabilities was founded in 1962 by a group of concerned parents. Originally called the Association for Children with Learning Disabilities, the Learning Disabilities Association of Canada \u2013 LDAC was created to provide awareness and services for individuals with learning disabilities, their families, at work, and the community. Since education is largely the responsibility of each province and territory in Canada, provinces and territories have jurisdiction over the education of individuals with learning disabilities, which allows the development of policies and support programs that reflect the unique multicultural, linguistic, and socioeconomic conditions of its area.\nUnited Kingdom.\nIn the UK, terms such as specific learning difficulty (SpLD), developmental dyslexia, developmental coordination disorder and dyscalculia are used to cover the range of learning difficulties referred to in the United States as \"learning disabilities\". In the UK, the term \"learning disability\" refers to a range of developmental disabilities or conditions that are almost invariably associated with more severe generalized cognitive impairment. \"The Lancet\" defines 'learning disability' as a \"significant general impairment in intellectual functioning acquired during childhood\", and states that roughly one in 50 British adults have one.\nJapan.\nIn Japan, acknowledgement and support for students with learning disabilities has been a fairly recent development, and has improved drastically in the last decade. The first definition for learning disability was coined in 1999, and in 2001, the Enrichment Project for the Support System for Students with Learning Disabilities was established. Since then, there have been significant efforts to screen children for learning disabilities, provide follow-up support, and provide networking between schools and specialists.\nEffects.\nThe effects of having a learning disability or learning difference are not limited to educational outcomes: individuals with learning disabilities may experience social problems as well. Neuropsychological differences can affect the accurate perception of social cues with peers. Researchers argue persons with learning disabilities not only experience negative effects as a result of their learning distinctions, but also as a result of carrying a stigmatizing label. It has generally been difficult to determine the efficacy of special education services because of data and methodological limitations. Emerging research suggests adolescents with learning disabilities experience poorer academic outcomes even compared to peers who began high school with similar levels of achievement and comparable behaviors. It seems their poorer outcomes may be at least partially due to the lower expectations of their teachers; national data show teachers hold expectations for students labeled with learning disabilities that are inconsistent with their academic potential (as evidenced by test scores and learning behaviors). It has been said that there is a strong connection between children with a learning disability and their educational performance.\nMany studies have been done to assess the correlation between learning disability and self-esteem. These studies have shown that an individual's self-esteem is indeed affected by their own awareness of their learning disability. Students with a positive perception of their academic abilities generally tend to have higher self-esteem than those who do not, regardless of their actual academic achievement. However, studies have also shown that several other factors can influence self-esteem. Skills in non-academic areas, such as athletics and arts, improve self-esteem. Also, a positive perception of one's physical appearance has also been shown to have positive effects of self-esteem. Another important finding is that students with learning disabilities are able to distinguish between academic skill and intellectual capacity. This demonstrates that students who acknowledge their academic limitations but are also aware of their potential to succeed in other intellectual tasks see themselves as intellectually competent individuals, which increases their self-esteem.\nResearch involving individuals with learning disabilities who exhibit challenging behaviors who are subsequently treated with antipsychotic medications provides little evidence that any benefits outweigh the risk.\nCauses.\nThe causes for learning disabilities are not well understood, and sometimes there is no apparent cause for a learning disability. However, some causes of neurological impairments include:\n Learning disabilities are often linked through genetics and run in the family. Children who have learning disabilities often have parents who have the same struggles. Children of parents who had less than 12 years of school are more likely to have a reading disability. Some children have spontaneous mutations (i.e. not present in either parent) which can cause developmental disorders including learning disabilities. One study estimated that about one in 300 children had such spontaneous mutations, for example a fault in the CDK13 gene which is associated with learning and communication difficulties in the children affected.\n A learning disability can result from anomalies in the developing brain, illness or injury. Risk factors are fetal exposure to alcohol or drugs and low birth weight (3 pounds or less). These children are more likely to develop a disability in math or reading. Children who are born prematurely, late, have a longer labor than usual, or have trouble receiving oxygen are more likely to develop a learning disability.\nLearning disabilities can also be caused by head injuries, malnutrition, or by toxic exposure (such as heavy metals or pesticides).\nDiagnosis.\nIQ-achievement discrepancy.\nLearning disabilities can be identified by psychiatrists, speech language pathologists, school psychologists, clinical psychologists, counseling psychologists, neuropsychologists, speech language pathologists, and other learning disability specialists through a combination of intelligence testing, academic achievement testing, classroom performance, and social interaction and aptitude. Other areas of assessment may include perception, cognition, memory, attention, and language abilities. The resulting information is used to determine whether a child's academic performance is commensurate with their cognitive ability. If a child's cognitive ability is much higher than their academic performance, the student is often diagnosed with a learning disability. The DSM-IV and many school systems and government programs diagnose learning disabilities in this way (DSM-IV uses the term \"disorder\" rather than \"disability\").\nAlthough the discrepancy model has dominated the school system for many years, there has been substantial criticism of this approach among researchers. Recent research has provided little evidence that a discrepancy between formally measured IQ and achievement is a clear indicator of LD. Furthermore, diagnosing on the basis of a discrepancy does not predict the effectiveness of treatment. Low academic achievers who do not have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are also low) appear to benefit from treatment just as much as low academic achievers who do have a discrepancy with IQ (i.e. their IQ scores are higher than their academic performance would suggest).\nSince 1998 there have been attempts to create a reference index more useful than IQ to generate predicted scores on achievement tests. For example, for a student whose vocabulary and general knowledge scores matches their reading comprehension score a teacher could assume that reading comprehension can be supported through work in vocabulary and general knowledge. If the reading comprehension score is lower in the appropriate statistical sense it would be necessary to first rule out things like vision problems\nResponse to intervention.\nMuch current research has focused on a treatment-oriented diagnostic process known as response to intervention (RTI). Researcher recommendations for implementing such a model include early screening for all students, placing those students who are having difficulty into research-based early intervention programs, rather than waiting until they meet diagnostic criteria. Their performance can be closely monitored to determine whether increasingly intense intervention results in adequate progress. Those who respond will not require further intervention. Those who do not respond adequately to regular classroom instruction (often called \"Tier 1 instruction\") and a more intensive intervention (often called \"Tier 2\" intervention) are considered \"non-responders.\" These students can then be referred for further assistance through special education, in which case they are often identified with a learning disability. Some models of RTI include a third tier of intervention before a child is identified as having a learning disability.\nA primary benefit of such a model is that it would not be necessary to wait for a child to be sufficiently far behind to qualify for assistance. This may enable more children to receive assistance before experiencing significant failure, which may, in turn, result in fewer children who need intensive and expensive special education services. In the United States, the 2004 reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act permitted states and school districts to use RTI as a method of identifying students with learning disabilities. RTI is now the primary means of identification of learning disabilities in Florida.\nThe process does not take into account children's individual neuropsychological factors such as phonological awareness and memory, that can inform design instruction. By not taking into account specific cognitive processes, RTI fails to inform educators about a students' relative strengths and weaknesses Second, RTI by design takes considerably longer than established techniques, often many months to find an appropriate tier of intervention. Third, it requires a strong intervention program before students can be identified with a learning disability. Lastly, RTI is considered a regular education initiative and consists of members of general education teachers, in conjunction with other qualified professionals. Occupational therapists (OT's) in particular can support students in the educational setting by helping children in academic and non-academic areas of school including the classroom, recess and meal time. They can provide strategies, therapeutic interventions, suggestions for adaptive equipment, and environmental modifications. OT's can work closely with the child's teacher and parents to facilitate educational goals specific to each child under an RTI and/or IEP.\nLatino English language learners.\nDemographers in the United States report that there has been a significant increase in immigrant children in the United States over the past two decades. This information is vital because it has been and will continue to affect both students and how educators approach teaching methods. Various teaching strategies are more successful for students that are linguistic or culturally diverse versus traditional methods of teaching used for students whose first language is English. It is then also true that the proper way to diagnose a learning disability in English language learners (ELL) differs. In the United States, there has been a growing need to develop the knowledge and skills necessary to provide effective school psychological services, specifically for those professionals who work with immigrant populations.\nCurrently, there are no standardized guidelines for the process of diagnosing English language learners (ELL) with specific learning disabilities (SLD). This is a problem since many students will fall through the cracks as educators are unable to clearly assess if a student's delay is due to a language barrier or true learning disability. With an unclear diagnosis, many students will suffer because they will not be provided with the tools they need to succeed in the public education school system. For example, in many occasions teachers have suggested retention or have taken no action at all when they lack experience working with English language learners. Students were commonly pushed toward testing, based on an assumption that their poor academic performance or behavioral difficulties indicated a need for special education. Linguistically responsive psychologist understand that second language acquisition is a process and they understand how to support ELLs' growth in language and academically. When ELLs are referred for a psychoeducational assessment, it is difficult to isolate and disentangle what are the effects of the language acquisition process, from poor quality educational services, from what may be academic difficulties that result from processing disorders, attention problems, and learning disabilities. Additionally not having trained staff and faculty becomes more of an issue when staff is unaware of numerous types of psychological factors that immigrant children in the U.S dealing could be potentially dealing with. These factors that include acculturation, fear and/or worry of deportation, separation from social supports such as parents, language barriers, disruptions in learning experiences, stigmatization, economic challenge, and risk factors associated with poverty. In the United States, there are no set policies mandating that all districts employ bilingual school psychologist, nor are schools equipped with specific tools and resources to assist immigrant children and families. Many school districts do not have the proper personnel that is able to communicate with this population.\nSpanish-speaking ELL.\nA well trained bilingual school psychologist will be able to administer and interpret assessment all psychological testing tool. Also, an emphasis is placed on informal assessment measures such as language samples, observations, interviews, and rating scales as well as curriculum-based measurement to complement information gathered from formal assessments. A compilation of these tests is used to assess whether an ELL student has a learning disability or merely is academically delayed because of language barriers or environmental factors. It is very unfortunate that many schools do not have school psychologist with the proper training nor access to appropriate tools. Also, many school districts frown upon taking the appropriate steps to diagnosing ELL students.\nAssessment.\nMany normed assessments can be used in evaluating skills in the primary academic domains: reading, including word recognition, fluency, and comprehension; mathematics, including computation and problem solving; and written expression, including handwriting, spelling and composition.\nThe most commonly used comprehensive achievement tests include the Woodcock-Johnson IV (WJ IV), Wechsler Individual Achievement Test II (WIAT II), the Wide Range Achievement Test III (WRAT III), and the Stanford Achievement Test\u201310th edition. These tests include measures of many academic domains that are reliable in identifying areas of difficulty.\nIn the reading domain, there are also specialized tests that can be used to obtain details about specific reading deficits. Assessments that measure multiple domains of reading include Gray's Diagnostic Reading Tests\u20132nd edition (GDRT II) and the Stanford Diagnostic Reading Assessment. Assessments that measure reading subskills include the Gray Oral Reading Test IV\u00a0\u2013 Fourth Edition (GORT IV), Gray Silent Reading Test, Comprehensive Test of Phonological Processing (CTOPP), Tests of Oral Reading and Comprehension Skills (TORCS), Test of Reading Comprehension 3 (TORC-3), Test of Word Reading Efficiency (TOWRE), and the Test of Reading Fluency. A more comprehensive list of reading assessments may be obtained from the Southwest Educational Development Laboratory.\nThe purpose of assessment is to determine what is needed for intervention, which also requires consideration of contextual variables and whether there are comorbid disorders that must also be identified and treated, such as behavioral issues or language delays. These contextual variables are often assessed using parent and teacher questionnaire forms that rate the students' behaviors and compares them to standardized norms.\nHowever, caution should be made when suspecting the person with a learning disability may also have dementia, especially as people with Down's syndrome may have the neuroanatomical profile but not the associated clinical signs and symptoms. Examination can be carried out of executive functioning as well as social and cognitive abilities but may need adaptation of standardized tests to take account of special needs.\nTypes.\nLearning disabilities can be categorized by either the type of information processing affected by the disability or by the specific difficulties caused by a processing deficit.\nBy stage of information processing.\nLearning disabilities fall into broad categories based on the four stages of information processing used in learning: input, integration, storage, and output. Many learning disabilities are a compilation of a few types of abnormalities occurring at the same time, as well as with social difficulties and emotional or behavioral disorders. \n This is the information perceived through the senses, such as visual and auditory perception. Difficulties with visual perception can cause problems with recognizing the shape, position, or size of items seen. There can be problems with sequencing, which can relate to deficits with processing time intervals or temporal perception. Difficulties with auditory perception can make it difficult to screen out competing sounds in order to focus on one of them, such as the sound of the teacher's voice in a classroom setting. Some children appear to be unable to process tactile input. For example, they may seem insensitive to pain or dislike being touched.\n This is the stage during which perceived input is interpreted, categorized, placed in a sequence, or related to previous learning. Students with problems in these areas may be unable to tell a story in the correct sequence, unable to memorize sequences of information such as the days of the week, able to understand a new concept but be unable to generalize it to other areas of learning, or able to learn facts but be unable to put the facts together to see the \"big picture.\" A poor vocabulary may contribute to problems with comprehension.\n Problems with memory can occur with short-term or working memory, or with long-term memory. Most memory difficulties occur with one's short-term memory, which can make it difficult to learn new material without more repetitions than usual. Difficulties with visual memory can impede learning to spell.\n Information comes out of the brain either through words, that is, language output, or through muscle activity, such as gesturing, writing or drawing. Difficulties with language output can create problems with spoken language. Such difficulties include answering a question on demand, in which one must retrieve information from storage, organize our thoughts, and put the thoughts into words before we speak. It can also cause trouble with written language for the same reasons. Difficulties with motor abilities can cause problems with gross and fine motor skills. People with gross motor difficulties may be clumsy, that is, they may be prone to stumbling, falling, or bumping into things. They may also have trouble running, climbing, or learning to ride a bicycle. People with fine motor difficulties may have trouble with handwriting, buttoning shirts, or tying shoelaces.\nBy function impaired.\nDeficits in any area of information processing can manifest in a variety of specific learning disabilities. It is possible for an individual to have more than one of these difficulties. This is referred to as comorbidity or co-occurrence of learning disabilities. In the UK, the term \"dual diagnosis\" is often used to refer to co-occurrence of learning difficulties.\nReading disorder (ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes: F81.0/315.00).\nReading disorder is the most common learning disability. Of all students with specific learning disabilities, 70\u201380% have deficits in reading. The term \"Developmental Dyslexia\" is often used as a synonym for reading disability; however, many researchers assert that there are different types of reading disabilities, of which dyslexia is one. A reading disability can affect any part of the reading process, including difficulty with accurate or fluent word recognition, or both, word decoding, reading rate, prosody (oral reading with expression), and reading comprehension. Before the term \"dyslexia\" came to prominence, this learning disability used to be known as \"word blindness.\"\nCommon indicators of reading disability include difficulty with phonemic awareness\u2014the ability to break up words into their component sounds, and difficulty with matching letter combinations to specific sounds (sound-symbol correspondence).\nDisorder of written expression (ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR codes 315.2).\nThe DSM-IV-TR criteria for a disorder of written expression is writing skills (as measured by a standardized test or functional assessment) that fall substantially below those expected based on the individual's chronological age, measured intelligence, and age-appropriate education, (Criterion A). This difficulty must also cause significant impairment to academic achievement and tasks that require composition of written text (Criterion B), and if a sensory deficit is present, the difficulties with writing skills must exceed those typically associated with the sensory deficit, (Criterion C).\nIndividuals with a diagnosis of a disorder of written expression typically have a combination of difficulties in their abilities with written expression as evidenced by grammatical and punctuation errors within sentences, poor paragraph organization, multiple spelling errors, and excessively poor penmanship. A disorder in spelling or handwriting without other difficulties of written expression do not generally qualify for this diagnosis. If poor handwriting is due to an impairment in the individuals' motor coordination, a diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder should be considered.\nBy a number of organizations, the term \"dysgraphia\" has been used as an overarching term for all disorders of written expression.\nMath disability (ICD-10 and DSM-IV codes F81.2-3/315.1).\nSometimes called dyscalculia, a math disability involves difficulties such as learning math concepts (such as quantity, place value, and time), difficulty memorizing math facts, difficulty organizing numbers, and understanding how problems are organized on the page. Dyscalculics are often referred to as having poor \"number sense\".\nManagement.\nInterventions include:\nSternberg has argued that early remediation can greatly reduce the number of children meeting diagnostic criteria for learning disabilities. He has also suggested that the focus on learning disabilities and the provision of accommodations in school fails to acknowledge that people have a range of strengths and weaknesses, and places undue emphasis on academic success by insisting that people should receive additional support in this arena but not in music or sports. Other research has pinpointed the use of resource rooms as an important\u2014yet often politicized component of educating students with learning disabilities.\nSociety and culture.\nSchool laws.\nSchools in the United States have a legal obligation to new arrivals to the country, including undocumented students. The landmark Supreme Court ruling Plyler v. Doe (1982) grants all children, no matter their legal status, the right to a free education. This ruling suggests that as a country we acknowledge that we have a population of students with specific needs that differ from those of native speakers. Additionally specifically in regards to ELL's the supreme court ruling Lau v. Nichols (1974) stated that equal treatment in school did not mean equal educational opportunity. Thus if a school teaches a lesson in a language that students do not understand then they are effectively worthless. This ruling is also supported by English language development services provided in schools, but these rulings do not require the individuals that teach and provide services to have any specific training nor is licensing different from a typical teacher or services provider.\nCritique of the medical model.\nLearning disability theory is founded in the medical model of disability, in that disability is perceived as an individual deficit that is biological in origin. Researchers working within a social model of disability assert that there are social or structural causes of disability or the assignation of the label of disability, and even that disability is entirely socially constructed. Since the turn of the 19th century, education in the United States has been geared toward producing citizens who can effectively contribute to a capitalistic society, with a cultural premium on efficiency and science. More agrarian cultures, for example, do not even use learning ability as a measure of adult adequacy, whereas the diagnosis of learning disabilities is prevalent in Western capitalistic societies because of the high value placed on speed, literacy, and numeracy in both the labor force and school system.\nCulture.\nThere are three patterns that are well known in regards to mainstream students and minority labels in the United States:\nIn the present day, it has been reported that white districts have more children from minority backgrounds enrolled in special education than they do majority students. \u201cIt was also suggested that districts with a higher percentage of minority faculty had fewer minority students placed in special education suggesting that 'minority students are treated differently in predominantly white districts than in predominantly minority districts'\".\nEducators have only recently started to look into the effects of culture on learning disabilities. If a teacher ignores a student's culturally diverse background, the student will suffer in the class. \u201cThe cultural repertoires of students from cultural learning disorder backgrounds have an impact on their learning, school progress, and behavior in the classroom\u201d. These students may then act out and not excel in the classroom and will, therefore, be misdiagnosed: \u201cOverall, the data indicates that there is a persistent concern regarding the misdiagnosis and inappropriate placement of students from diverse backgrounds in special education classes since the 1975\u201d.\nSocial roots of learning disabilities in the U.S..\nLearning disabilities have a disproportionate identification of racial and ethnic minorities and students who have low socioeconomic status (SES). While some attribute the disproportionate identification of racial/ethnic minorities to racist practices or cultural misunderstanding, others have argued that racial/ethnic minorities are overidentified because of their lower status. Similarities were noted between the behaviors of \u201cbrain-injured\u201d and lower class students as early as the 1960s. The distinction between race/ethnicity and SES is important to the extent that these considerations contribute to the provision of services to children in need.\nWhile many studies have considered only one characteristic of the student at a time, or used district- or school-level data to examine this issue, more recent studies have used large national student-level datasets and sophisticated methodology to find that the disproportionate identification of African American students with learning disabilities can be attributed to their average lower SES, while the disproportionate identification of Latino youth seems to be attributable to difficulties in distinguishing between linguistic proficiency and learning ability. Although the contributing factors are complicated and interrelated, it is possible to discern which factors really drive disproportionate identification by considering a multitude of student characteristics simultaneously. For instance, if high SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among high SES Whites, and low SES minorities have rates of identification that are similar to the rates among low SES Whites, we can know that the seemingly higher rates of identification among minorities result from their greater likelihood to have low SES. Summarily, because the risk of identification for White students who have low SES is similar to that of Black students who have low SES, future research and policy reform should focus on identifying the shared qualities or experiences of low SES youth that lead to their disproportionate identification, rather than focusing exclusively on racial/ethnic minorities. It remains to be determined why lower SES youth are at higher risk of incidence, or possibly just of identification, with learning disabilities.\nLearning disabilities in adulthood.\nA common misconception about those with learning disabilities is that they outgrow it as they enter adulthood. This is often not the case and most adults with learning disabilities still require resources and care to help manage their disability. One resource available is the Adult Basic Education (ABE) programs, at the state level. ABE programs are allotted certain amounts of funds per state in order to provide resources for adults with learning disabilities. This includes resources to help them learn basic life skills in order to provide for themselves. ABE programs also provide help for adults who lack a high school diploma or an equivalent. These programs teach skills to help adults get into the workforce or into a further level of education. There is a certain pathway that these adults and instructors should follow in order to ensure these adults have the abilities needed to succeed in life. Some ABE programs offer GED preparation programs to support adults through the process to get a GED. It is important to note that ABE programs do not always have the expected outcome on things like employment. Participants in ABE programs are given tools to help them succeed and get a job but, employment is dependent on more than just a guarantee of a job post-ABE. Employment varies based on the level of growth a participant experiences in an ABE program, the personality and behavior of the participant, and the job market they are entering into following completion of an ABE program. \nAnother program to assist adults with disabilities are federal programs called \"home and community based services\" (HCBS). Medicaid funds these programs for many people through a fee waiver system, however, there are still lots of people on a stand-by list. These programs are primarily used for adults with Autism Spectrum Disorders. HCBS programs offer service more dedicated to caring for the adult, not so much providing resources for them to transition into the workforce. Some services provided are: therapy, social skills training, support groups, and counseling. \nContrast with other conditions.\nPeople with an IQ lower than 70 are usually characterized as having an intellectual disability and are not included under most definitions of learning disabilities because their difficulty in learning are considered to be related directly to their overall low intelligence.\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is often studied in connection with learning disabilities, but it is not actually included in the standard definitions of learning disabilities. Individuals with ADHD may struggle with learning, but can often learn adequately once successfully treated for the ADHD. A person can have ADHD but not learning disabilities or have learning disabilities without having ADHD. The conditions can co-occur.\nPeople diagnosed with ADHD sometimes have impaired learning. Some of the struggles people with ADHD have might include lack of motivation, high levels of anxiety, and the inability to process information. There are studies that suggest people with ADHD generally have a positive attitude toward academics and, with developed study skills, can perform just as well as individuals without learning disabilities. Also, using alternate sources of gathering information, such as websites, study groups, and learning centers, can help a person with ADHD be academically successful.\nSome research is beginning to make a case for ADHD being included in the definition of LDs since it is being shown to have a strong effect on \"executive functions\" required for learning. This has not as yet affected any official definitions. Though, historically, ADHD was not clearly distinguished from other disabilities related to learning. Scientific research continues to explore the traits, struggles, and learning styles of those with ADHD."}
